      <title>Multi-messenger observations in the Einstein Telescope era: binary neutron star and black hole - neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), a proposed next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatory, will expand the reach of GW astronomy of stellar-mass compact object binaries to unprecedented distances, enhancing opportunities for multi-messenger observations. Here we investigate multi-messenger emission properties of binary neutron star (NSNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers detectable by ET, providing projections to optimize observational strategies and maximize scientific insights from these sources. Using a synthetic population of compact binary mergers, we model each source's GW signal-to-noise ratio, sky localization uncertainty, kilonova (KN) light curves in optical and near-infrared bands, fluence of the relativistic jet gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission and afterglow light curves across radio, optical, X-ray and very high energy wavelengths. We analyze multi-messenger detectability prospects for ET as a standalone observatory with two different configurations and within a network of next-generation GW detectors. ET will detect over $10^4$ NSNS mergers annually, enabling potential observation of tens to hundreds of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. BHNS mergers have more limited multi-messenger prospects, but joint GW-EM rates will increase by an order of magnitude compared to current-generation instruments. We quantify uncertainties due to the NS equation of state (EoS) and mass distribution of NSNSs, as well as the NS EoS and BH spin for BHNSs. While a single ET will achieve an impressive GW detection rate, the fraction of well-localized events is orders of magnitude lower than in a network with additional detectors. This significantly limits efficient EM follow-up and science cases requiring well-characterized counterparts or early observations. The challenge is even greater for BHNS mergers due to their low EM rate.</description>

      <title>Filamentary Ejecta Network in Cassiopeia~A Reveals Fingerprints of the Supernova Explosion Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] Recent JWST observations have revealed an intricate filamentary network of unshocked ejecta in the young supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A (Cas A), offering new insights into supernova (SN) explosions and ejecta evolution. We investigate the origin and evolution of this structure by (i) characterizing its 3D morphology and kinematics and (ii) identifying the physical mechanisms driving its formation. Using high-resolution hydrodynamic (HD) and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we model the evolution of a neutrino-driven SN from explosion to a remnant age of 1000 years. The initial conditions, set just after shock breakout, are based on a 3D neutrino-driven SN model matching Cas A's basic properties. We find that magnetic fields have little impact on unshocked ejecta evolution, so we focus on HD simulations. A web-like filamentary structure, consistent with JWST observations (down to $\sim 0.01$ pc), naturally forms during the explosion. These filaments arise from early post-collapse processes, including neutrino-heated bubble expansion, hydrodynamic instabilities during blast propagation, and the Ni-bubble effect after shock breakout. The reverse shock later disrupts the filaments via hydrodynamic instabilities, rendering them unobservable by $\sim 700$ years. Our models suggest that JWST-detected filaments in Cas A preserve a 'memory' of early explosion conditions, tracing processes active during and immediately after the SN event. Notably, a filamentary network akin to Cas A's emerges naturally from a neutrino-driven SN explosion.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Timing Analysis of PSR J1741-3016: Efficient Noise Characterization Using PINT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stable rotation of young pulsars is often interrupted by two non-deterministic phenomena: glitches and red timing noise. Timing noise provides insights into plasma and nuclear physics under extreme conditions. The framework leverages rotational symmetry in pulsar spin-down models and temporal symmetry in noise processes to achieve computational efficiency, aligning with the journal's focus on symmetry principles in physical systems. In this paper, we apply a novel frequentist framework developed within the PINT software package (v0.9.8) to analyze single-pulsar noise processes. Using 17.5 years of pulse time-of-arrival (TOA) data for the young pulsar PSR J1741-3016, observed with the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope, we investigate its timing properties. In this study, we employed the Downhill Weighted Least-Squares Fitter to estimate the pulsar's spin parameters and position. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used for model parameter selection. The results obtained with PINT were compared to those from ENTERPRISE and TEMPONEST, two Bayesian-based frameworks. We demonstrate that PINT achieves comparable results with significantly reduced computational costs. Additionally, the adequacy of the noise model can be readily verified through visual inspection tools. Future research will utilize this framework to analyze timing noise across a large sample of young pulsars.</description>

      <title>Disk draining in LIGO progenitor black hole binaries and its significance to electromagnetic counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of tidal forces on transport within a relic accretion disk in binary black holes is studied here with a suite of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. As the binary contracts due to the emission of gravitational waves, the accretion disk is truncated, and a two-armed spiral wave is excited, which remains stationary in the rotating reference frame of the coalescing binary. Such spiral waves lead to increased transport of mass and angular momentum. Our findings suggest that even in the case of weakly ionized accretion disks, spiral density waves will drain the disk long before the orbit of the two black holes decays enough for them to merge, thus dimming prospects for a detectable electromagnetic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study of a hyperluminous X-ray source near NGC 6099: a strong IMBH candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the intriguing properties of a variable X-ray source projected at the outskirts of the elliptical galaxy NGC 6099 ($d \approx 139$ Mpc). If truly located near NGC 6099, this is a hyperluminous X-ray source that reached an X-ray luminosity $L_{X} \approx $ a few times $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in 2012 February (XMM-Newton data), about 50 to 100 times brighter than in 2009 May (Chandra) and 2023 August (XMM-Newton). The X-ray spectrum was soft at all three epochs, with a thermal component at $kT \approx 0.2$ keV and a power-law photon index $&gt;3$. Such properties make it a strong candidate for an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). We also discovered a point-like, blue optical counterpart ($m_{g,{Vega}}\approx24.7$~mag, $M_{g,{Vega}}\approx-11.2$~mag), from images taken by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and later confirmed with Hubble Space Telescope observations. The optical continuum can be modeled as stellar emission from a compact star cluster or an X-ray-irradiated accretion disk, consistent with the IMBH scenario. We discuss alternative explanations for the nature of this system. A possible scenario is tidal stripping of an orbiting star, with repeated X-ray outbursts every few years. An alternative possibility is that the thermal X-ray emission seen in 2009 was from shocked gas in the self-intersecting tidal stream during the rising phase of a tidal disruption event, while the 2012 and 2023 emissions were from the fully-formed accretion disk.</description>

      <title>First X-ray polarimetric view of a Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus: the case of NGC 2110</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN) provides a unique view of Comptonization and non-thermal emission from accreting black holes in the low-accretion rate regime. However, to decipher the exact nature of the Comptonizing corona in LLAGN, its geometry and emission mechanism must be understood beyond the limits of spectro-timing techniques. Spectro-polarimetry offers the potential to break the degeneracies between different coronal emission models. Compton-thin LLAGN provide an opportunity for such spectro-polarimetric exploration in the 2-8 keV energy range using IXPE. In this work, we carry out a spectro-polarimetric analysis of the first IXPE observation, in synergy with a contemporaneous NuSTAR observation, of an LLAGN: NGC 2110. Using 554.4 ks of IXPE data from October 2024, we constrain the 99% upper limit on the Polarization Degree (PD) to be less than 8.3% assuming the corresponding Polarization Angle (PA) to be aligned with the radio jet, and less than 3.6% if in the perpendicular direction. In the absence of a significant PD detection, the PA remains formally unconstrained, yet the polarization significance contours appear to be aligned with the radio jet, tentatively supporting models in which the corona is radially extended in the plane of the disk. We also carry out detailed Monte Carlo simulations using MONK and STOKES codes to test different coronal models against our results and compare the polarization properties between NGC 2110 and brighter Seyferts.</description>

      <title>An Unusual Change in the Radio Jets of GRS 1915+105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare Very Large Array observations of GRS 1915+105 made in 1994 and 2023, with nearly three decades of difference. The source has experienced intriguing major changes. The position angle of the bipolar ejecta in the plane of the sky has increased counterclockwise by 24 degrees. The inclination angle of the flow with respect to the line of sight has increased by 17 degrees. Analysis of GRS 1915+105 images over the years suggest that the observed changes took place within a year or less. Our analysis indicates that during 2023 the plane of the accretion disk was aligned with the line of sight, which may explain the deep X-ray obscured state and the high mid-infrared luminosity observed with JWST in that epoch. More recent 2024 observations imply that the position angle of the ejecta has returned to its historic values. We suggest that these abrupt changes could be due to the presence of an undetected tertiary component in the system. Future monitoring of the time evolution of the source may further clarify the cause of these remarkable changes.</description>

      <title>An 85-s X-ray quasi-periodicity after a stellar tidal disruption by a candidate intermediate-mass black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is still in dispute the existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with a mass of ~10^3-10^5 solar masses (Msun), which are the missing link between stellar-mass black holes (5-50 Msun) and supermassive black holes (10^6-10^10 Msun). The bright flares from tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a new and direct way to probe IMBHs. 3XMM J215022.4-055108 is a unique off-nuclear X-ray transient which can be best explained as the TDE by an IMBH in a massive star cluster, though its mass is not well determined. Here, we report the discovery of a transient X-ray quasi-periodicity signal from 3XMM J215022.4-055108 with a period of ~85 seconds (at a significance of &gt;3.51sigma) and fractional root-mean-squared amplitude of ~10%. Furthermore, the signal is coherent with a quality factor ~16. The significance drops to &gt;3.13sigma if considering all light curves with sufficient quality for QPO search. Combining with the results from X-ray continuum fittings, the detection of QPO allows for joint constraints on the black hole mass and dimensionless spin in the range [9.9*10^3-1.6*10^4 Msun]$ and [0.26-0.36], respectively. This result supports the presence of an IMBH in an off-nuclear massive star cluster and may open up the possibility of studying IMBHs through X-ray timing of TDEs.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Electromagnetic Signatures from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.</description>

      <title>The relation between black hole spin and star formation in massive star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has always been believed that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) has an important impact on star formation in massive galaxies. Black hole spin is an important physical parameter of AGN. We use a large sample of massive star-forming galaxies to study the effects of AGN on star formation. Our main results are as follows: (i) There are significant correlations between black hole spin and star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and star formation activity parameter for massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies, respectively. These results indicate that the spin of supermassive black holes regulates the star formation of massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies. (2) The slopes of the relationship between black hole spin and star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and star formation activity parameter for massive star-forming early-type galaxies and late-type galaxies are similar within the error range. These results imply that the mechanism of black hole spin regulating star formation may be similar in massive star-forming early-type and late-type galaxies.</description>

      <title>Back to business: SLX 1746--331 after 13 years of silence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole candidate system SLX 1746--331 was back to business in 2023, after a long silence of roughly 13 years. An outburst was observed thoroughly by \textit{Insight}-HXMT and \textit{NICER}. The outburst is characterized by spectral dominance of the soft state, where the joint \textit{Insight}-HXMT and \textit{NICER} spectral analysis shows the temperature dependence of the disk flux follows $T_{\rm in}^{3.98}$, and thus suggests that the inner disk reaches to ISCO during almost the entire outburst. By assuming 0.3 $L_{\rm Edd}$ for the peak flux and an inclination angle of zero degrees, the lower limit of the compact object hosted in this system is estimated as 3.28$\pm 2.14 M_\odot$. We also look into the relation of the disk temperature and disk flux for a sample of black hole systems, and by taking the disk temperature derived in the outburst of SLX 1746--331, such a relation results in a mass estimation of $5.2 \pm 4.5M_\odot$. Finally, the spin of the compact object is constrained to larger than 0.8 with a spectral model of kerrbb.</description>

      <title>NICER, NuSTAR and Insight-HXMT views to the newly discovered black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8--1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swift J1727.8--1613 is a black hole X-ray binary newly discovered in 2023. We perform spectral analysis with simultaneous Insight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR observations when the source was approaching to the hard intermediate state. Such a joint view reveals an additional hard component apart from the normally observed hard component with reflection in the spectrum, to be distinguished from the usual black hole X-ray binary systems. By including this extra component in the spectrum, we have measured a high spin of $0.98^{+0.02}_{-0.07}$ and an inclination of around $40^{+1.2}_{-0.8}$ degrees, which is consistent with NICER results reported before. However, we find that the additional spectral component can not be exclusively determined due to the model degeneracy. Accordingly, a possible jet/corona configuration is adjusted to account for the spectral fitting with different model trials. The extra component may originate either from a relativistic jet or a jet base/corona underneath a slow jet.</description>

      <title>NICER, NuSTAR and Insight-HXMT views to black hole X-ray binary SLX 1746--331</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral and temporal properties of the black hole X-ray transient binary SLX 1746--331 during the 2023 outburst with NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT observations. Through the joint fitting of the spectra from NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT, the spin and inclination angles are measured for the first time as $0.85 \pm 0.03$ and $53\pm 0.5$\textdegree, respectively. Accordingly, the mass of the compact star is updated from the previous lower limit of 3.3$\pm 2.1 M_\odot$ to $5.5\pm 3.6 M_\odot$, which is consistent with $5.2 \pm 4.5M_\odot$ measured with an empirical mass-luminosity correlation of BH samples. With more NICER observations covering the later decay of the outburst, we confirm that the entire outburst was dominated by the disk emissions, and the thermal spectrum follows $F \propto T_{\rm in}^{3.974\pm 0.003}$, till a luminosity of over than two magnitudes lower than the maximum of the outburst.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study for gamma-ray nova V1405 Cas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01278v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novae are found to have GeV to TeV gamma-ray emission, which reveals the shock acceleration from the white dwarfs. Recently, V1405 Cas was reported to radiated suspicious gamma-ray by \textit{Fermi}-LAT with low significance ($4.1 \sigma$) after the optical maximum. Radio observations reveal that it is one of the five brightest novae surrounded by low-density ionized gas columns. Here we report continuous search for GeV gamma-ray from \textit{Fermi}-LAT. No gamma-ray were found. For V1405 Cas, the flux level is lower than other well-studied \textit{Fermi} novae, and the gamma-ray maximum appear at $t_{0} + 145$ d. Gamma-ray of V1405 Cas are used to search potential gamma-ray periodicity. No gamma-ray periodicity was found during the time of observation. By comparing multi-wavelength data, the gamma-ray upper limit to optical flux ratio with value at around $10^{-4}$ is obtained to constrain the shock acceleration. Long-term analysis from \textit{Swift}-XRT gets X-ray spectral in the post-shock phase, which indicates that V1405 Cas became a super-soft source. The best-fit black body temperature at the super soft state is 0.11 - 0.19 keV.</description>

      <title>Core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the explosive end-points of stellar evolution for $M_{ZAMS} \gtrsim 8$ $M_\odot$ stars. The cores of these stars collapse to neutron stars, a process in which high neutrino luminosity drives off the overlying stellar layers, which get ejected with thousands of kilometers per second. These supernovae enrich their host galaxies with elements made both during the star's life and in the explosion, providing the main cosmic source of elements such as oxygen, neon and silicon. Their high luminosities ($\sim$ $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak) make SNe beacons to large distances, and their light curves and spectra provide rich information on single and binary stellar evolution, nucleosynthesis, and a diverse set of high-energy physical processes. As the SN ejecta sweep up circumstellar and interstellar matter, it eventually enters a supernova remnant phase, exemplified by nearby, spatially resolved remnants such as Cas A and the Crab Nebula. In this phase, shocks and pulsar winds continue to light up the interior of the exploded stars, giving detailed information about their 3D structure. We review the central concepts of CCSNe, from the late stages of evolution of massive stars, through collapse, explosion, and electromagnetic display, to the final remnant phase. We briefly discuss still open questions, and current and future research avenues.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from dense environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos from dense environments are unique laboratories for astrophysics, particle physics and many-body physics. They tell us about the last stages of the gravitational core-collapse and the explosion of massive stars. These elusive particles are also tightly linked to heavy elements synthesis in gravitational core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, or play a pivotal role at the MeV epoch during the Universe expansion. We highlight theoretical and observational aspects of this interesting domain, in particular for the future measurement of neutrinos from the next core-collapse supernova, and of the diffuse supernova background, whose discovery might lie in the forthcoming future.</description>

      <title>Magnetar structure in nonlinear electrodynamics with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars have inferred polar field strengths in excess of the Schwinger limit, where nonlinear electromagnetic effects can be significant. Their internal fields may be even stronger, suggesting that Maxwellian characterisations of hydromagnetic structure may require revision. A generalised Grad-Shafranov equation, describing static and axisymmetric fluid stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields, is introduced and subsequently solved in a perturbative scheme to calculate quadrupolar deformations. In the Born-Infeld theory, we show that the toroidal field has a maximum strength set by the scale parameter, $b$, implying an upper limit to the stellar prolateness, $|\epsilon_{\rm max}| \sim 10^{-5} \left(b/10^{16}\text{ G}\right)^2$, that is independent of field specifics. Observations of magnetar phenomena that are interpreted as evidence for ellipticity, such as precession, can thus implicitly constrain post-Maxwellian parameters in a way that complements terrestrial experiments. Toroidal ceilings also have implications for dynamo theory and gravitational waves, which we revisit together with field evolution in crusts abiding by beyond-Maxwell physics.</description>

      <title>A kinematically constrained kick distribution for isolated neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnitudes of the velocity kicks that neutron stars (NSs) obtain at their formation have long been a topic of discussion, with the latest studies analysing the velocities of young pulsars and favouring a bimodal kick distribution. In previous work, a novel method was proposed to determine kicks based on the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories. We applied this method to the isolated pulsars with known parallax in order to kinematically constrain the NS natal kick distribution and investigate its proposed bimodality. Since this method is applicable to older pulsars, we effectively increase the sample size with ${\sim}50\%$ compared to the pulsars younger than $10$ Myr. We assumed the velocity vectors of the pulsars to be distributed isotropically in the local standard of rest frame. These velocity vectors were used to trace back the trajectories of the NSs through the Galaxy and estimate their eccentricity. Then, we simulated kicked objects in order to evaluate the relationship between kick magnitude and Galactic eccentricity, which was used to infer the kicks corresponding to the estimated eccentricities. The resulting kick distributions indeed show a bimodal structure for young pulsars. However, for older pulsars the bimodality vanishes and instead we find a log-normal kick distribution peaking at ${\sim}200$ km/s and a median of ${\sim}400$ km/s. We therefore conclude that the natal kicks of these isolated NSs are best described by log-normal distribution with $\mu=6.38$ and $\sigma=1.01$. This analysis reveals no evidence for bimodality in the larger sample, and we suggest that the bimodality found by existing literature may be caused by Poisson noise due to their relatively small sample size.</description>

      <title>Thermal X-ray signatures in late-stage unequal-mass massive black hole binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-messenger combination of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) and the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart from the surrounding circumbinary disk (CBD) will open avenues to new scientific pursuits. In order to realize this science, we need to correctly localize the host galaxy of the merging MBHB. Multi-wavelength, time-dependent electromagnetic (EM) signatures can greatly facilitate the identification of the unique EM counterpart among many sources in LISA's localization volume. To this end, we studied merging unequal-mass MBHBs embedded in a CBD using high-resolution 2D simulations, with a $\Gamma$-law equation of state, incorporating viscous heating, shock heating and radiative cooling. We simulate each binary starting from before it decouples from the CBD until just after the merger. We compute EM signatures and identify distinct features before, during, and after the merger. We corroborate previous findings of a several order of magnitude drop in the thermal X-ray luminosity near the time of merger, but with delayed timing compared to an equal-mass system. The source remains X-ray dark for hours post-merger. Our main results are a potential new signature of a sharp spike in the thermal X-ray emission just before the tell-tale steep drop occurs. This feature may further help to identify EM counterparts of LISA's unequal MBHBs before merger without the need for extensive pre-merger monitoring. Additionally, we find a role-reversal, in which the primary out-accretes the secondary during late inspiral, which may diminish signatures originating from Doppler modulation.</description>

      <title>Is Gamma-ray Burst Polarization from Photosphere Emission?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite more than half a century of research, the dominant radiation mechanism of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission remains unsolved. Some progress has been made through the analyses of the observational spectra of Swift/BAT, Konus/Wind, and Fermi/GBM, as well as the spectra of the photosphere or synchrotron models, but it is still insufficient to pin down the answer. Recent and upcoming high-sensitivity polarization observations can provide additional instructive information for model evaluation. In this work, we thoughtfully investigate the polarization samples of POLAR and AstroSAT, combining the light curve, the spectral, and the polarization parameters. The power-law shape of the X-ray afterglows, the $T_{90}\propto (L_{\text{iso}})^{-0.5}$ correlation, and the hard low-energy spectral index $\alpha$ are revealed, thus supporting the photosphere origin. Furthermore, we discover the positive correlation of the $\alpha$ and the polarization degree (PD), which can be consistently explained by the photosphere polarization scenario involving the jet asymmetry from a moderate viewing angle of $\theta _{v}$=0.015.</description>

      <title>SN 2024ggi: another year, another striking Type II supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova that exploded in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 at a distance of approximately 7 Mpc, making it one of the closest supernovae of the decade. This SN shows clear signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar material, and several studies have investigated the properties of its possible progenitor star using pre-explosion data. In this work we aim to constrain the progenitor properties of SN 2024ggi by performing hydrodynamical modeling of its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024ggi obtained in the Complejo Astron\'omico El Leoncito, in Las Campanas Observatory, and in Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, spanning from 2 to 106 days after explosion. We constructed its bolometric light curve and we characterize it by calculating its morphological parameters. Then, we computed a grid of one dimensional explosion models for evolved stars with varying masses and estimated the properties of the progenitor star of SN 2024ggi by comparing the models to the observations. The observed bolometric luminosity and expansion velocities are well-matched by a model involving the explosion of a star in the presence of a close circumstellar material (CSM), with a zero-age main sequence mass of $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}$ = 15 $M_{\odot}$, a pre-SN mass and radius of 14.1 $M_{\odot}$ and 517 $R_{\odot}$, respectively, an explosion energy of $1.3\times10^{51}$ erg, and a nickel mass below 0.035 $M_{\odot}$. Our analysis suggests that the progenitor suffered a mass-loss rate of $4 \times 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, confined to a distance of 3000 $R_{\odot}$. The CSM distribution is likely a two-component structure that consists of a compact core and an extended tail. This analysis represents the first hydrodynamical model of SN 2024ggi with a complete coverage of the plateau phase.</description>

      <title>Signature of hadronic emission in gamma-ray spectrum of B2 1308+326</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) B2\,1308+326 was in its highest $\gamma$-ray flaring state during 60260-60310\,MJD. During this period, the source was detected in very high energy (VHE) by the large-sized telescope (LST-1). We conducted a detailed broadband spectral study of this source using the simultaneous data available in optical/UV, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands. For the broadband spectral study, we select two gamma-ray high flux states (59750-59800\,MJD, 60260-60310\,MJD) and one low flux state (59250-59320\,MJD). During the epochs, 59750-59800\,MJD (high flux state) and 59250-59320\,MJD (low flux state), the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) is well fitted using one zone leptonic emission model involving synchrotron, synchrotron self Compton (SSC) and external Compton (EC) processes. However, the flaring state (60260-60310\,MJD) during which the source showed VHE emission requires an additional component. We show that the inclusion of the photo-meson process can successfully explain this excess $\gamma$-ray emission. Further the estimated parameters, also suggest the source is transparent to VHE gamma-rays against pair production process.</description>

      <title>Plans for a new array of radio antennas for the detection of air showers at the 433m surface-detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and science case for a new array of radio antennas to be located at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Six stations of three SKALA antennas each will be deployed around a single water-Cherenkov surface detector triggering the radio readout. The planned antenna layout will allow for the detection of cosmic rays above a few tens of PeV and reach full efficiency for vertical air showers at several hundred PeV in primary energy. The array will thus be a pathfinder to demonstrate that fully-efficient radio detection in combination with the underground muon detectors already present at the location is possible. This will enable combined studies of the muon component and the depth of shower maximum, relevant for hadronic interaction models studies and more accurate determination of the cosmic-ray mass composition in the energy range of the Galactic-to-extragalactic transition.</description>

      <title>Radio Observation of the Pulsar Wind Nebula in SNR G11.2-0.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are important sources for understanding galactic high-energy processes, but it is controversial until now about how high-energy particles in PWNe are accelerated and transported. Lacking radio counterparts of X-ray PWNe (the proposed acceleration sites) introduce difficulties to better understandings in multi wavelengths. Our recent 3, 6, and 16\,cm high-resolution observations of G11.2$-$0.3 PWN with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) uniquely show morphological similarity with its X-ray PWN (a torus/jet feature). Spectral indices of the radio torus and jet are around -0.09 and -0.10, respectively. Meanwhile for the jet region, the spectral break between radio and X-ray spectra implies particle acceleration mechanisms other than a diffusive shock acceleration. Polarization results suggest a helical B-field inside the jet, the equipartition B-field strength of which is below 100\,$\mu$G.</description>

      <title>Possible origin of the KM3-230213A neutrino event from dark matter decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of the highest energy neutrino event with 220 PeV energy, detected recently by the KM3NeT experiment to be originating from heavy dark matter (DM) decay. Considering a heavy right handed neutrino (RHN) DM for illustrative purpose, we show that DM mass of 440 PeV, can explain the observed flux. The required DM lifetime to produce the best-fit value of the neutrino flux saturates the existing gamma-ray bounds. Due to the large uncertainty in the flux, it is possible to explain the KM3NeT event from RHN DM decay at $3\sigma$ confidence level (CL) while being in agreement with gamma-ray bounds and non-observation of similar events at IceCube. While we consider a gauged $B-L$ scenario where DM relic can be generated due to other interactions, we also briefly discuss some alternate DM possibilities where the gamma-ray bounds can be alleviated compared to the minimal RHN DM discussed here.</description>

      <title>Assessment of universal relations among second-order moments of relativistic stars via reformulated perturbation equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the universal relations among second-order moments of relativistic stars, namely the moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and spin-induced quadrupole moment, via reformulated perturbation equations. After constructing the spherical background configuration by solving two ordinary differential equations as usual, these three moments are obtained by solving four additional ordinary differential equations. They are solved numerically from the stellar center to the surface, and we do not need to derive homogeneous solutions for obtaining the quadrupole moment. This small number of ordinary differential equations to be solved enables us to identify the primary variable for each second-order moment. Investigating the profile of these variables in the star, we speculate that their nonmonotonic behavior, enhanced typically for soft equations of state and/or high compactnesses, introduces the variety to the relations among these second-order moments unless the black-hole limit is approached.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Neural Networks: Emulating Late Burning Stages in Core Collapse Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in modeling massive stars to the onset of core collapse is the computational bottleneck of nucleosynthesis during advanced burning stages. The number of isotopes formed requires solving a large set of fully-coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), making the simulations computationally intensive and prone to numerical instability. To overcome this barrier, we design a nuclear neural network (NNN) framework with multiple hidden layers to emulate nucleosynthesis calculations and conduct a proof-of-concept to evaluate its performance. The NNN takes the temperature, density and composition of a burning region as input and predicts the resulting isotopic abundances along with the energy generation and loss rates. We generate training sets for initial conditions corresponding to oxygen core depletion and beyond using large nuclear reaction networks, and compare the predictions of the NNNs to results from a commonly used small net. We find that the NNNs improve the accuracy of the electron fraction by $280-660\:\%$ and the nuclear energy generation by $250-750\:\%$, consistently outperforming the small network across all timesteps. They also achieve significantly better predictions of neutrino losses on relatively short timescales, with improvements ranging from $100-10^{6}\:\%$. While further work is needed to enhance their accuracy and applicability to different stellar conditions, integrating NNN trained models into stellar evolution codes is promising for facilitating large-scale generation of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors with higher physical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Backreaction of perturbations around a stable Light Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light rings (LRs) - closed circular orbits of null geodesics - are key features of both black holes and horizonless ultracompact objects. While unstable LRs are relevant for the observation of black hole images, stable LRs have been suspected to trigger instabilities, namely in exotic compact objects that could mimic black holes. The underlying mechanism behind this instability remains poorly understood, but a key missing piece is how the backreaction of a perturbation around the stable LR modifies the surrounding spacetime. In this work, some progress in this direction is provided by examining a conceptually simple, yet instructive, toy model: continuum-shell stars, supported solely by tangential pressures. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we show how perturbations around the stable LR deepen the geodesic potential and shifts its location inward, potentially amplifying any instability associated with the LR. By then extending the analysis to more general stars with nonzero radial pressure, we find that the same phenomenon can be expected to persist under reasonable assumptions.</description>

      <title>Criteria for ion acceleration in laboratory magnetized quasi-perpendicular collisionless shocks: when are 2D simulations enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of collisionless shocks and their role in cosmic ray acceleration has gained importance through observations and simulations, driving interest in reproducing these conditions in laboratory experiments using high-power lasers. In this work, we examine the role of three-dimensional (3D) effects in ion acceleration in quasi-perpendicular shocks under laboratory-relevant conditions. Using hybrid particle-in-cell simulations (kinetic ions and fluid electrons), we explore how the Alfv\'enic and sonic Mach numbers, along with plasma beta, influence ion energization, unlocked only in 3D, and establish scaling criteria for when conducting 3D simulations is necessary. Our results show that efficient ion acceleration requires Alfv\'enic Mach numbers $\geq 25$ and sonic Mach numbers $\geq 13$, with plasma-$\beta \leq 5$. We theoretically found that, while 2D simulations suffice for current laboratory-accessible shock conditions, 3D effects become crucial for shock velocities exceeding 1000 km/s and experiments sustaining the shock for at least 10 ns. We surveyed previous laboratory experiments on collisionless shocks and found that 3D effects are unimportant under those conditions, implying that 1D and 2D simulations should be enough to model the accelerated ion spectra. However, we do find that the same experiments are realistically close to accessing the regime relevant to 3D effects, an exciting prospect for future laboratory efforts. We propose modifications to past experimental configurations to optimize and control 3D effects on ion acceleration. These proposed experiments could be used to benchmark plasma astrophysics kinetic codes and/or employed as controllable sources of energetic particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review talk explores the diverse outcomes of white dwarf mergers, emphasising that not all double degenerate mergers result in supernovae. Possible outcomes include the formation of a more massive WD, partial explosions that leave behind unusual remnants, and merger-induced collapse leading to the formation of rapidly spinning neutron stars or magnetars. Additionally, merging WDs have been proposed as potential progenitors for long gamma-ray bursts and Fast Radio Bursts.</description>

      <title>Observational properties of black hole in quantum fluctuation modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the properties of the thin accretion disk around a black hole in quantum fluctuation modified gravity (QFMGBH) using the Novikov-Thorne model. We restrict the parameter \( \alpha \) characterizing the quantum fluctuation of metric and compute the ISCO radius, examining its effect on the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the luminosity spectrum, the energy efficiency, and the shadow size for various values of the parameter \( \omega \) characterizing the matter around the black hole. Our findings show that the ISCO radius increases with \( \alpha \) for \( \omega = 1/3, 0, -2/3 \), but decreases for \( \omega = -4/3 \). As \( \alpha \) increases, the energy flux and the temperature show distinct trends, with changes in the luminosity spectrum and the efficiency. The shadow size increases for \( \omega = 1/3, 0, -2/3 \), and decreases for \( \omega = -4/3 \). The accretion disk around the QFMGBH is smaller, hotter, and brighter than that surrounded the Schwarzschild BH in GR, suggesting that the observable differences can potentially distinguish quantum fluctuation modified gravity from standard GR.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Electron Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On electron kinetic scales, ions and electrons decouple, and electron velocity shear on electron inertial length $\sim d_e$ can trigger electromagnetic (EM) electron Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (EKHI). In this paper, we present an analytic study of EM EKHI in an inviscid collisionless plasma with a step-function electron shear flow. We show that in incompressible collisionless plasma the ideal electron frozen-in condition $\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_e \times \mathbf{B}/c = 0$ must be broken for the EM EKHI to occur. In a step-function electron shear flow, the ideal electron frozen-in condition is replaced by magnetic flux conservation, i.e., $\nabla \times (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_e\times \mathbf{B}/c) = 0$, resulting in a dispersion relation similar to that of the standard ideal and incompressible magnetohydrodynamics KHI. The magnetic field parallel to the electron streaming suppresses the EM EKHI due to magnetic tension. The threshold for the EM mode of the EKHI is $(\mathbf{k}\cdot\Delta\mathbf{U}_e)^2&gt;\frac{n_{e1}+n_{e2}}{n_{e1} n_{e2}}[n_{e1}(\mathbf{v}_{Ae1}\cdot\mathbf{k})^2+n_{e2}(\mathbf{v}_{Ae2}\cdot\mathbf{k})^2]$, where $\mathbf{v}_{Ae} =\mathbf{B}/(4\pi m_e n_e)^{1/2}$, $\Delta\mathbf{U}_e$ and $n_e$ are the electron streaming velocity shear and densities, respectively. The growth rate of the EM mode is $\gamma_{em} \sim \Omega_{ce}$, the electron gyro-frequency.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Nova Simulations with an Extended Buffer and Lower Initial Mixing Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical nova is a thermonuclear runaway initiated on a white dwarf accreting solar-like material from its stellar companion. Once the white dwarf accretes enough mass, the pressure at the base of the accreted layer reaches a critical point, leading to the ignition of the hydrogen fuel at their interface. This paper presents a set of two-dimensional CO classical nova simulations with an extended buffer zone of a fixed low density and temperature between the top of the accreted layer and the upper boundary, allowing us to capture the thermonuclear outburst in the domain. Our domain reduces the role of the upper-outflow boundary condition that has affected previous simulations and allows us to explore the nucleosynthesis evolution in detail. We also study the effects of the initial temperature perturbation and buffer size to explore their sensitivity in our simulations. Finally, we start our simulations with a lower temperature at the base of the accreted layer ($7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{K}$) than previous work, allowing us to capture mixing earlier in the evolution, reducing the effects of the mixing-length-theory assumptions. This allows for a more realistic description of convective transport in our models.</description>

      <title>Collective Neutrino Oscillations in Three Flavors on Qubit and Qutrit Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor oscillations are of primary importance in understanding the dynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae and subsequent terrestrial detection, but also among the most challenging aspects of numerical simulations. This situation is complicated by the quantum many-body nature of the problem due to neutrino-neutrino interactions which demands a quantum treatment. An additional complication is the presence of three flavors, which often is approximated by the electron flavor and a heavy lepton flavor. In this work, we provide both qubit and qutrit encodings for all three flavors, and develop optimized quantum circuits for the time evolution and analyze the Trotter error. We conclude our study with a hardware experiment of a system of two neutrinos with superconducting hardware: the IBM Torino device for qubits and AQT device for qutrits. We find that error mitigation greatly helps in obtaining a signal consistent with simulations. While hardware results are comparable at this stage, we expect the qutrit setup to be more convenient for large-scale simulations since it does not suffer from probability leakage into nonphsycial qubit space, unlike the qubit setup.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Black holes surrounded by massive vector fields in Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact black hole solution surrounded by massive vector fields predicted by Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity. KK gravity in four dimensions (4D) is of particular interest, as it predicts a tower of particle states, including gravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 components, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity. The extra degrees of freedom in the gravitational sector modify the law of gravity, allowing the theory to explain the effects attributed to dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we construct a black hole solution surrounded by massive spin-1 gravitons within KK theory. In addition to the influence of the massive vector fields, we incorporate an interaction term between the black hole and the massive vector field. The black hole solution is affected by the mass of the spin-1 graviton and an additional parameter that encodes corrections to Newton's constant, as well as the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mass. We find that the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mimics the effect of an electric charge. To this end, we investigate the accretion disk, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and the stability of the black hole spacetime. Finally, we use Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A* to constrain the black hole parameters.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 $\mu$m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of $\sim1000-6000$ MJy ster$^{-1}$ which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 $\mu$m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.</description>

      <title>ASKAP observations of the radio shell in the composite supernova remnant G310.6-1.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observations of the radio shell of the supernova remnant (SNR) G310.6-1.6 at 943 MHz from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) and the Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) surveys by using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We detect polarized emission from the central pulsar wind nebula (PWN) with rotation measures varying from -696 rad m$^{-2}$ to -601 rad m$^{-2}$. We measure the integrated flux density of the shell to be 36.4 +/- 2.2 mJy at 943 MHz and derive a spectral index of -0.4 +/- 0.1 for the PWN and -0.7 +/- 0.3 for the SNR shell. From the combined radio and X-ray observations, the object can be identified as a supernova explosion of about 2500 yr ago with energy of about 1.3 x 10$^{50}$ erg, suggesting an ejected mass of about 10 M_sun. The circular radio shell outside the circular hard X-ray shell is unique among Galactic SNRs. We discuss several possible scenarios, including blast wave, reverse shock, and pulsar-fed emission, but find that none of them can fully explain the observed characteristics of the shell. This poses a challenge for understanding the evolution of SNRs. The results of this paper demonstrate the potential of the ASKAP EMU and POSSUM surveys in discovering more objects of small angular size and low surface brightness.</description>

      <title>MIR: a general-relativistic resistive-magneto-hydrodynamic code to study the effect of resistivity in Neutron Star dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical resistivity plays a fundamental role in many astrophysical systems, influencing the evolution of the magnetic field and energy dissipation processes. During the coalescence of two neutron stars, resistive effects can significantly affect the dynamics and gravitational and electromagnetic signatures associated with these events, such as gamma-ray bursts and kilonova emission. Here, we present our new code, named MIR. Developed within the EinsteinToolkit framework, MIR solves the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations in 3D Cartesian coordinates and on a dynamical spacetime using the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, in both the ideal and resistive regimes, filling a crucial gap in the toolkit's capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of solutions of multidimensional gravity which are formally related to black-hole solutions but can observationally look like compact stars whose surface reflects back all particles or signals getting there. Some particular examples of such solutions are presented and studied, including those with a magnetic field in Maxwell or nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) in five dimensions. For NED as a possible source for magnetic mirror stars, we formulate a methodology of solving the 5D Einstein-NED equations and point out the conditions under which there always exist mirror star solutions. We also note that some of the Einstein-Maxwell solutions under consideration are discussed in the literature and called ``topological stars'' due to the circular topology of the fifth dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of rare emergence (31 nights from 360 nights of observations) of narrow absorption features in hydrogen and helium lines in stationary SS433 spectra with velocities ranging from $-650$ to $-1900$ km/s. The components arise independently of the appearance of P-Cygni line profiles which are frequently observed in the SS433 stationary spectra with terminal velocities ranging from $-200$ to $\sim -2500$ km/s. The characteristic rising time of the transient absorptions is about one day and the decay time is about two days. The phenomenology of the absorptions suggests their origin due to hydrodynamic instabilities of wind outflows from a supercritical accretion disk in SS433.</description>

      <title>Evolution of proto-neutron stars to pulsars, magnetars and central compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.01051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the young neutron stars, the magnetars, have ultra-strong magnetic fields. The models invoked for the origin of magnetar fields require very specific conditions with extreme parameters, which are incompatible with the inference that the birth rate of magnetars is comparable to the rate of core-collapse supernovae. We propose that these seemingly contradictory trends can be reconciled if both pulsars and magnetars pass through a dynamo process at the proto-neutron star (PNS) stage. We invoke a shear-driven dynamo model for the generation of PNS magnetic fields. We argue that the toroidal fields of central compact objects are shaped by the $\Omega$-effect, even though they do not pass through a genuine dynamo process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting compact objects are crucial to understand several important astrophysical phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae, gravitational waves, or X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bursts. In addition, they are natural laboratories to infer fundamental properties of stars, to investigate high-energy phenomena and accretion processes, to test theories of stellar and binary evolution, to explore interactions between high-density plasma and very strong magnetic fields, to examine the interplay between binary evolution and dynamical interactions (in the case they belong to dense star clusters), and they can even be used as a probe for the assembling process of galaxies over cosmic time-scales. Despite the fundamental importance of accreting compact objects for astrophysics and recent progress with the comprehension of these fascinating objects, we still do not fully understand how they form and evolve. In this chapter, we will review the current theoretical status of our knowledge on these objects, and will discuss standing problems and potential solutions to them.</description>

      <title>The impact of disk outflows on the structure of short GRB jets at large scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are known to be associated with binary neutron star (NSNS) or black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers. The detection of gravitational wave and its associated electromagnetic counterparts GW/GRB 170817A has shown that interactions between relativistic jets and mildly relativistic ejecta influence observed radiation. Previous studies simulated a uniform jet propagating through a homologously expanding wind, however, jets and disk outflows are launched together during accretion, making the interaction more complex. We investigate how the disk wind impacts jet propagation at distances $r\sim 10^8\,-\,10^{11}~$cm. We are using two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamical simulations. As initial conditions, we remap the outflows from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations of BH accretion disks that represent post-merger NSNS or BHNS remnants. We account for wind stratification and r-process nucleosynthesis, which alter the pressure profile from that of an ideal gas in the initial conditions. We found that a) self-consistent wind pressure leads to significant changes in the jet collimation and cocoon expansion; b) the angular structure of thermal and kinetic energy components in the jets, cocoons, and winds differ with respect to simple homologous models; c) the temporal evolution of the structure reveals conversion of thermal to kinetic energy being different for each component in the system (jet, cocoon, and wind); d) dynamical ejecta alters the interaction between jets and disk winds. Our results show that the jet and cocoon structure is shaped by the accretion disk wind that alters the effect of dynamical ejecta and may have an impact on the observed afterglow emission.</description>

      <title>AstroSat View of Transient Low-mass X-ray Binary XTE J1701-462: Spectral and Temporal Evolution along the Z-track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AstroSat observed transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1701-462 for a total duration of $\sim$ 135 ks during its 2022 outburst. The source traced a complete `Z' shaped structure in the hardness intensity diagram (HID). The source exhibited an extended horizontal branch and a short-dipping flaring branch in the HID. We find that most suitable spectral model comprises emission from a standard multi-color accretion disk (diskbb in XSPEC) and Comptonized radiation from a hot central corona, described by Comptb model of XSPEC. The observed disk component is cool, having a temperature in the range of 0.28-0.42 keV and truncated far (250 - 1600 km) from the compact object. The Compton corona has an optical depth in the range of 3.4-5.1 and a temperature in the range of 3.3-4.5 keV. The disk and corona flux as well as truncation radius vary significantly along the HID. The temperature $kT_{in}$ depends on both luminosity and inner disk radius and hence shows marginal variation as compared to the truncation radius. The timing analysis revealed horizontal branch oscillations in the frequency range $\sim 34-40$ Hz. The frequency and rms strength of HBO vary systematically as the source moves along the horizontal branch. The observed correlation of the HBO properties with the position on the HB is similar to that previously reported in this source using RXTE data during the 2006 outburst of the source. The source also showed normal branch oscillations with frequency $\sim$ 6.7 Hz in the middle and the lower normal branch. The energy-dependent study of the HBO properties suggests that the HBO is stronger in the higher energy band. We also observed very-low frequency noise and band-limited noise components in the power density spectra. The break frequency of BLN component was found to be tightly correlated with the HBO frequency.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Suppression of Cosmic Rays' Flux in $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ and $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic diffusion on the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) from a cosmological perspective. To this end, we consider two modified theories of gravity (MTGs), namely, the $f(R)$ gravity and a symmetric teleparallel gravity, also known as $f(Q)$ gravity. Utilizing these two MTGs, we calculate the suppression in the flux of UHECRs for a collection of sources. Non-evolution (NE) and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) scenarios have been considered in our calculation of the suppression factor. This study also includes a mixed composition scenario involving the nuclei upto iron (Fe). Furthermore, we provide a parameterization of the suppression factor for the proton and also for the mixed compositions within the $f(R)$ and $f(Q)$ theories, considering both NE and SFR scenarios. The influence of the turbulent magnetic field on the suppression factor is also incorporated in our work. Comparative analysis of all our results with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model reveals significant effects of MTGs on the suppression factor that the $f(R)$ power-law model predicts the lowest suppression factor, while the $f(Q)$ model predicts the highest, and interestingly the results from the standard model fall within the range predicted by these two cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Follow the Mass -- A Concordance Picture of Tidal Disruption Events</title>

Abstract: Three recent global simulations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have produced, using different numerical techniques and parameters, very similar pictures of their dynamics. In typical TDEs, after the star is disrupted by a supermassive black hole, the bound portion of the stellar debris follows highly eccentric trajectories, reaching apocenters of several thousand gravitational radii. Only a very small fraction is captured upon returning to the vicinity of the supermassive black hole. Nearly all the debris returns to the apocenter, where shocks produce a thick irregular cloud on this radial scale and power the optical/UV flare. These simulation results imply that over a few years, the thick cloud settles into an accretion flow responsible for the long term emission. Despite not being designed to match observations, and without adjusting any parameters, the dynamical picture given by the three simulations aligns well with observations of typical events, correctly predicting the flares' typical total radiated energy, luminosity, temperature and emission line width. On the basis of these predictions, we provide an updated method (TDEmass) to infer the stellar and black hole masses from a flare's peak luminosity and temperature. This picture also correctly predicts that the luminosity observed years after the flare should be nearly constant. In addition, we show that in a magnitude-limited survey, if the intrinsic rate of TDEs is independent of black hole mass, the detected events will preferentially have black hole masses $\sim 10^{6.3 \pm 0.3} M_\odot$ and stellar masses $\sim 1 M_\odot$, with the width of the mass distribution for disrupted stars sensitive to the stellar mass function in the host galaxy's center.</description>

      <title>A novel experimental approach to uncover the nature of cosmic-ray Deuterium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the isotopic composition of cosmic-rays (CRs) provides crucial insights into the galactic environment and helps improve existing propagation models. Special attention is given to the secondary-to-primary ratios of light isotopic components in CRs, as these measurements can offer complementary data compared to traditional secondary-to-primary ratios like B/C. Recently, a precision measurement of the Deuterium (D) abundance in CR in the 2-21 GV rigidity range provided by the AMS02 experiment unexpectedly detected an excess of D with respect to its expected secondary nature, opening the field for new measurements at high rigidity to determine how the spectrum evolves and whether there is confirmation of a primary or primary plus secondary origin. While there are theoretical models that attempt to explain this excess, the experimental uncertainties on D production cross-sections and on CR propagation models remain significant, and only new and precise measurements can dissipate existing doubts. In this work we review the current experimental scenario and we propose a dedicated experiment able to extend the D abundance measurement up to 100 GeV/nucl without the need of a magnetic spectrometer, using a multiple scattering based technique for the measurement of particle momentum. The expected performances of the proposed detector were assessed through a dedicated simulation using the GEANT4 package, and its role in the current particle physics scenario is discussed.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption events as the origin of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: The recently discovered spherical eROSITA bubbles arise up to a latitude of $\pm$80\deg-85\deg in the X-ray regime of the Milky Way halo. Similar to the $\gamma$-ray Fermi bubbles, they evolve around the Galactic center, making a common origin plausible. However, the driving mechanism and evolution of both bubbles are still under debate. Aims: We investigate whether hydrodynamic energy injections at the Galactic center, such as e.g. tidal disruption events (TDEs), could have inflated both bubbles. The supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is expected to tidally disrupt a star every 10-100 kyr, potentially leading to an outflow from the central region that drives a shock propagating into the Galactic halo due to its vertically declining density distribution, ultimately forming a superbubble that extends out of the disk similar to the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles. Methods: We model TDEs in the Galaxy using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, considering different Milky Way mass models and TDE rates. We then generate synthetic X-ray maps and compare them with observations. Results: Our simulation results of a $\beta$-model Milky Way halo show that superbubbles, blown for 16 Myr by regular energy injections at the Galactic center that occur every 100 kyr, can have a shape, shell stability, size, and evolution time similar to estimates for the eROSITA bubbles, and an overall structure reminiscent of the Fermi bubbles. The $\gamma$-rays in our model would stem from cosmic ray interactions at the contact discontinuity, where they were previously accelerated by first-order Fermi acceleration at in situ shocks. Conclusions: Regular TDEs in the past 10-20 Myr near the Galactic center could have driven an outflow resulting in both, the X-ray emission of the eROSITA bubbles and the $\gamma$-ray emission of the Fermi bubbles.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Magnetic Field and UHECR Deflections</title>

Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) experience deflections as they traverse the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), which must be accounted for when tracing them back to their sources. After briefly summarizing our results on uncertainties in cosmic-ray deflections from the UF23 ensemble of GMF models (Unger &amp; Farrar, 2024), we report a new preliminary fit of the GMF including foreground emission from the Local Bubble. This fit uses the analytic model of Pelgrims et al. (2024) for the magnetic field in the thick shell of Galactic bubbles. We also discuss how variations in toroidal halo field modeling account for the key differences between the Jansson &amp; Farrar (2012) GMF model and the UF23 ensemble.
  Furthermore, we extend our previous analysis of the origin of the highest-energy "Amaterasu" event observed by the Telescope Array to include the four highest-energy events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. Amaterasu and PAO070114 are the UHECR events with the smallest localization uncertainties of 4.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Neither of their back-tracked directions aligns with any compelling candidate for a continuous UHECR accelerator. This strengthens the evidence that at least a fraction of the highest energy events originate from transient sources.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Radio Telescope Dark Matter Search in the L and S Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03439v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic dark matter in its most general form can be detected through its decay or annihilation to a quasimonochromatic radio line. Assuming only that this line is consistent with the most general properties of the expected phase space of our Milky Way halo, we have developed and carried out a novel model-independent search for dark matter in the L and S bands. More specifically, the search selects for a line that exhibits a Doppler shift with position according to the solar motion through a static halo and similarly varies in intensity with position with respect to the galactic center. Over the combined L- and S-band range 1020 - 2700 MHz, radiative annihilation of dark matter is excluded above $\langle\sigma v\rangle \approx 10^{-30} \text{ cm}^3 \text{ s}^{-1}$, and for decay above $\lambda \approx 10^{-32} \text{ s}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Impact of calibration uncertainties on Hubble constant measurements from gravitational-wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detections of electromagnetically bright compact binary coalescences can provide an independent measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. In order to obtain a measurement that could help arbitrate the existing tension on $H_0$, one needs to fully understand any source of systematic biases for this approach. In this study, we aim to understand the impact of instrumental calibration errors (CEs) on the measurements of the luminosity distance, $D_L$, and the inferred $H_0$ value. We simulate binary neutron star mergers (BNSs), as detected by a network of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo interferometers at their design sensitivity. We artificially add CEs equal to exceptionally large values experienced in LIGO-Virgo's third observing run (O3). We find that for individual BNSs at a network signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the systematic errors on $D_L$ - and hence $H_0$ - are still smaller than the statistical uncertainties. The biases become more significant when we combine multiple events to obtain a joint posterior on $H_0$. In the rather unrealistic case that the data around each detection is affected by the same CEs corresponding to the worst offender of O3, the true $H_0$ value would be excluded from the 90% credible interval after we combine $\sim$40 sources. If instead, 10% of the sources suffer from severe CEs, the true value of $H_0$ is included in the 90% credible interval even after 100 sources.</description>

      <title>Identifying thermal effects in neutron star merger remnants with model-agnostic waveform reconstructions and third-generation detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02493v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We probe the intrinsic differences in simulated gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, arising from varying approaches to incorporating thermal effects in numerical-relativity modeling. We consider a hybrid approach in which the equation of state (EOS) comprises a cold, zero-temperature, piecewise-polytropic part and a thermal part described by an ideal gas, and a tabulated approach based on self-consistent, microphysical, finite-temperature EOS. We use time-domain waveforms corresponding to BNS merger simulations with four different EOSs. Those are injected into Gaussian noise given by the sensitivity of the third-generation detector Einstein Telescope and reconstructed using BayesWave, a Bayesian data-analysis algorithm that recovers the signals through a model-agnostic approach. The two representations of thermal effects result in different dominant peak frequencies in the spectra of the postmerger signals, for both the quadrupole fundamental mode and the late-time inertial modes. For some of the EOSs investigated those differences are large enough to be told apart, especially in the early postmerger phase when the signal amplitude is the loudest. Our results suggest that a self-consistent treatment of thermal effects in BNS postmerger modeling is essential to prevent significant parameter biases in upcoming gravitational-wave detections.</description>

      <title>Probing superheavy dark matter through lunar radio observations of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos and the impacts of neutrino cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy neutrinos (UHE$\nu$s) can be used as a valuable probe of superheavy dark matter above $\sim 10^9$ GeV, the latter being difficult to probe with collider and direct detection experiments due to the feebly interacting nature. Searching for radio emissions originating from the interaction of UHE$\nu$s with the lunar regolith enables us to explore energies beyond $10^{12}$ GeV, which astrophysical accelerators cannot achieve. Taking into account the interaction of UHE$\nu$s with the cosmic neutrino background and resulting standard neutrino cascades to calculate the neutrino flux on Earth, for the first time, we investigate sensitivities of such lunar radio observations to very heavy dark matter. We also examine the impacts of cosmogenic neutrinos that have the astrophysical origin. We show that the proposed ultra-long wavelength lunar radio telescope, as well as the existing low-frequency array, can provide the most stringent constraints on decaying or annihilating superheavy dark matter with masses at $\gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV. The limits are complementary to or even stronger than those from other UHE$\nu$ detectors, such as the IceCube-Gen2 radio array and GRAND.</description>

      <title>Inflation with the Trace Anomaly Action and Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inflation in a recently proposed gravitational effective field theory describing the trace anomaly. The theory requires an additional scalar which is massless in the early universe. This scalar -- referenced as an anomalyon -- couples to the familiar matter and radiation through the gauge field trace anomaly. We derive a class of cosmological solutions that deviate from the standard inflationary ones only slightly, in spite of the fact that the anomalyon has a sizable time dependent background. On the other hand, the scalar cosmological perturbations in this theory are different from the conventional inflationary perturbations. The inflaton and anomalyon perturbations mix, and one of the diagonal combinations gives the standard nearly scale-invariant adiabatic spectrum, while the other combination has a blue power spectrum at short distance scales. We argue that this blue spectrum can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) at distance scales much shorter than the ones tested in CMB observations. The resulting PBHs can be heavy enough to survive to the present day universe. For natural values of the parameters involved the PBHs would constitute only a tiny fraction of the dark matter, but with fine-tunings perhaps all of dark matter could be accounted by them. We also show that the theory predicts primordial gravitational waves which are almost identical to the standard inflationary ones.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star properties through parity-violating electron scattering experiments and relativistic point coupling interactions</title>

Abstract: Parity-violating electron scattering experiments on $\rm ^{48}Ca$ (CREX) and $\rm ^{208}Pb$ (PREX-2) offer valuable insight into the isovector properties of finite nuclei, providing constraints for the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state, which is crucial for understanding astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we establish functional dependencies between the properties of finite nuclei-such as weak charge form factors and neutron skin thickness-and the bulk properties of neutron stars, including tidal deformability from binary neutron star mergers and neutron star radii. The dependencies are formulated by introducing a family of $\beta$-equilibrated equations of state based on relativistic energy density functionals with point coupling interactions. The charge minus the weak form factors derived from CREX and PREX-2 measurements, combined with the observational constraints on tidal deformability from the GW170817 event, are used to constrain the symmetry energy and neutron star radii. Notably, the energy density expanded up to the fourth order in symmetry energy yields larger radii compared to calculations limited to the second order term. However, the results reveal a discrepancy between the constraints provided by the CREX and PREX-2 experiments. For a more quantitative assessment, higher precision parity-violating electron scattering data and neutron star observations are required.</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with a promising solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes surrounded by axions, then they may allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly enough via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~1 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to be quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a transition state between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of strange mesons.</description>

      <title>Nyquist-resolving gravitational waves via orbital frequency-based refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement efficiently facilitates the computation of gravitational waveforms in numerical relativity. However, determining precisely when, where, and to what extent to refine when solving the Einstein equations poses challenges; several ad hoc refinement criteria have been explored in the literature. This work introduces an optimized resolution baseline derived in situ from the inspiral trajectory (ORBIT). This method uses the binary's orbital frequency as a proxy for anticipated gravitational waves to dynamically refine the grid, satisfying the Nyquist frequency requirements on grid resolution up to a specified spin weighted spherical harmonic order. ORBIT sustains propagation of gravitational waves while avoiding the more costly alternative of maintaining high resolution across an entire simulation, both spatially and temporally. We find that enabling ORBIT decreases waveform noise by an order of magnitude and better resolves high-order wave amplitudes through merger. Combined with WAMR and other improvements, updates to Dendro-GR decrease waveform noise, decrease constraint violations, and boost refinement efficiency each by factors of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while reducing computational cost by a factor of four. ORBIT and other recent improvements to Dendro-GR begin to prepare us for gravitational wave science with next-generation detectors.</description>
