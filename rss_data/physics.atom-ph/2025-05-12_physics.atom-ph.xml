      <title>Determination of a set of fundamental constants from molecular hydrogen ion spectroscopy: a modeling study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rovibrational transition frequencies of molecular hydrogen ions (MHI) can be accurately computed using ab initio nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics. A subset of the fundamental constants are required input. We analyze how, once upcoming ultra-high-accuracy spectroscopy data has been obtained, that subset of constants can be determined with greater accuracy. Our analysis shows that under realistic assumptions the uncertainties of the mass ratios of proton, deuteron and triton relative to the electron, and of the triton charge radius can be reduced more than onehundred-fold compared to today (CODATA 2022). Furthermore, the Rydberg constant, as well as the proton and deuteron charge radii can be determined with uncertainties similar to those of today, but solely using data from electronic systems. The implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Selective ionization of Rydberg atoms to reduce the energy spread of a cold atom focused ion beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy spread of a focused ion beam causes chromatic aberration that limits the focal spot size and resolution for imaging and fabrication. Ion beams based on photoionization of neutral atoms can have a much smaller energy spread and higher brightness than conventional liquid metal ion sources and are thus capable of higher resolution. We present a method for using selective ionization of Rydberg atoms to reduce the beam energy spread in a cold atom focused ion beam. We produce experimental maps of the ionization rate of Rubidium-85 near the classical ionization threshold, predict the energy spread of an ion beam produced from these states and demonstrate energy spread reduction in situ in a focused ion beam. We use a novel method to measure the energy spread, using only components present in many commercial FIB systems. Selecting different states changed the energy spread by up to 50%, with opportunities to further reduce the energy spread by constructing a more favorable electric field gradient and finding atomic states with better ionization characteristics.</description>

      <title>Frequency Range Boosted Magnetometry Beyond the Spin Coherence Limit via Compressive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free induction decay (FID) of spin precession serves as an essential tool for quantum sensing across diverse platforms. While extending spin coherence time remains critical for sensitivity enhancement, the requisite long single-shot acquisitions narrow the resolvable frequency range, establishing a fundamental ``spin coherence limit (SCL)'', according to the Nyquist Sampling Theorem. Besides, conventional spectral analysis for FID measurement suffers from frequency alias, causing signal attenuation and positional errors that compromise the measurement validity. Here, we demonstrate a general frequency-range-extended technique that overcomes SCL by leveraging compressive sensing. By applying this method to the FID magnetometer, we expand the resolvable frequency range significantly from the Nyquist-limited range of 251\,Hz to 3000\,Hz, effectively avoiding frequency alias. Our work paves the way for implementing long-coherence-time spin systems in high-sensitivity, broad-bandwidth, and alias-free magnetic field sensing.</description>

      <title>Rydberg atomic spectrum analyzer with microwave-dressed-state-locking and multimode Floquet theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Rydberg atomic spectrum analyzer (RASA) utilizing microwave-dressed-state-locking (MWDSL) in conjunction with multimode Floquet theory (MFT). By leveraging a strong local microwave (MW) field resonant with Rydberg states to implement MWDSL, we analyze the second-order effect of MFT induced by the interplay of controllable bias and signal MW fields. This effect facilitates the coupling of locked dressed states, providing a pathway for measuring the signal MW field. We demonstrate that the RASA can simultaneously characterize multiple MW fields across distinct frequencies, with both the frequency and strength of each MW field discernible in the spectral response. This capability renders RASA suitable for measuring unknown-frequency MW fields, thereby expanding the utility of Rydberg atom-based electrometers in complex spectral analysis scenarios.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional Bose-Bose Mixture in Random Speckle Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the effect of the repulsive speckle potential in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates in one dimension (1D) and two dimension (2D). We simulated linear and circular random speckle potentials in 1D and 2D, respectively. Our calculation shows that the condensate density forms a sharp ring in 2D, and the condensate is divided into two parts in 1D at a high impurity density of speckle potential. We have calculated the energy and chemical potential of the system by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation to see the stability of the condensate. In our study, we have seen that the nature of the impurity response is the same for one-dimensional and two-dimensional quantum droplets.</description>

      <title>Resonances and continued-fraction Green's functions in non-Hermitian Bose-Hubbard-like quantum models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With resonances treated as eigenstates of a non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonian, the task of localization of the complex energy eigenvalues is considered. The paper is devoted to the reduced version of this task in which one only computes the real quantities called singular values. It is shown that in such an approach (and under suitable constraints including the tridiagonality of the Hamiltdonian) the singular values can be sought as poles of an auxiliary Green's function expressible in terms of a doublet of matrix continued fractions. A family of multi-bosonic Bose-Hubbard-like complex Hamiltonians is recalled for illustration purposes.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling for trapped-ion thermometry using dark resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate simulation of vibrational energy transport and quantum thermodynamics with trapped ions requires good methods for the estimation of temperatures. One valuable tool with this purpose is based on the fit of dark resonances in the fluorescence spectrum. However, the reliability of the procedure is still unclear. Here, we discuss several techniques with simplified dynamical equations for the numerical simulation of the spectrum of a trapped ion undergoing thermal motion, identifying advantages and limitations of each method. We start with a simplified three-level model to provide a better insight into the approximations involved and then move on to tackle the experimentally relevant case of an eight-level calcium ion. We observe that mimicking the effect of thermal motion by means of additional dephasing is computationally very convenient but can lead to significant errors in the estimation of the temperature. However, this can be counteracted by a proper calibration, supporting the use of dark resonances as a practical thermometer.</description>

      <title>Entering the overcritical regime of nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production in collisions of bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-rays and superintense, tightly focused laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-future high-intensity lasers offer prospects for the observation of nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production in an overcritical field regime, where the quantum nonlinearity parameter substantially exceeds unity. This experimentally yet unexplored scenario is envisaged here to be reached via the collision of a tightly focused laser pulse with high-energy bremsstrahlung photons. We calculate the achievable number of pairs in a range of laser intensities around 10$^{23}$ W/cm$^2$ and GeV-energies of the incident bremsstrahlung-generating electron beam. We investigate under which conditions the attenuation of the $\gamma$-beam due to the production process must be taken into account and how much the second generation of created pairs contributes to the total yield. In the considered interaction regime, where the local production rate grows rather moderately with higher field intensities, it is shown that the range of mostly contributing bremsstrahlung frequencies is generally very broad. For sufficiently large values of the quantum nonlinearity parameter, an optimum domain of frequencies emerges which is located far below the spectral endpoint. Furthermore, we show that it is beneficial for achieving the optimum pair yield to increase the interaction volume by a wider laser focus at the expense of decreased field intensity.</description>
