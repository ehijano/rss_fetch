      <title>Bayesian Analysis and Analytic Continuation of Scattering Amplitudes from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel procedure for analyzing the lattice-QCD spectrum via the finite-volume formalism to obtain constraints on multi-hadron scattering amplitudes at both real and complex energies. This approach combines a Bayesian reconstruction of the scattering amplitude on the real axis with Nevanlinna interpolation for analytic continuation to complex-valued energies. The method is non-parametric, inherently accounting for parametrization dependence within the uncertainty. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach using both toy data and real lattice-QCD data in resonant systems from the HadSpec and BaSc collaborations.</description>

      <title>Bounding statistical errors in lattice field theory simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of strongly interacting lattice field theories are typically performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Therefore estimators of statistical errors must incorporate the effect of autocorrelations by integrating the corresponding autocorrelation function. Since in practical calculations its integral is truncated to a finite window, in this work we propose a stopping criterion based on upper and lower bounds of the autocorrelation function. We examine its application to both traditional Monte Carlo analysis and the recently introduced master-field approach. By leveraging both bounds, we introduce an automatic windowing procedure which we test on numerical simulations of a few simplified toy models.</description>

      <title>Renormalized quark masses using gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new and simple method for determining the renormalized quark masses from lattice simulations. Renormalized quark masses are an important input to many phenomenological applications, including searching/modeling physics beyond the Standard Model. The non-perturbative renormalization is performed using gradient flow combined with the short-flow-time expansion that is improved by renormalization-group (RG) running to match to the $\overline{\text{MS}}$-scheme. RG running connects the lattice scale to higher energies thus improving the $\overline{\text{MS}}$-scheme matching. Implementing the RG running perturbatively, we demonstrate this method works reliably at least up to the charm-quark mass and is not exhibiting any signs of the usual ``window problem''. Using \abbrev{RBC/UKQCD}'s (2+1)-flavor Shamir domain-wall fermion ensembles with Iwasaki gauge action, we find $m_s^\overline{\text{MS}}(\mu=2 \text{ GeV}) = 90(3)$ MeV and $m_c^\overline{\text{MS}}(\mu=3 \text{ GeV}) = 975(10)$ MeV. These results predict the scale-independent ratio $m_c/m_s= 12.0(4)$. Generalization to other observables is possible, providing an efficient approach to determine non-perturbatively renormalized fermionic observables like form factors or bag parameters from lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of open confining strings in the large-Nc limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a thorough examination of the spectrum of the open confining string in 3+1 dimensions, commonly referred to as the open flux-tube, across various gauge groups of $SU(N_c)$. Our primary objective is to explore its behaviour as we approach the large-$N_c$ limit and the identification of possible world-sheet axion states. Specifically, we undertake a detailed analysis of the associated spectrum for $N_c=3, 4, 5, 6$. This marks the first systematic investigation of the open flux-tube spectrum within the context of the large-$N_c$ limit. More specifically, we analyse the spectra of flux-tubes that form between a static quark-antiquark pair, considering a significant number of radial excitations and eight irreducible representations characterized by the quantum numbers of angular momentum $\Lambda$, charge conjugation and parity $\eta_{CP}$ and the reflection symmetry $\epsilon$ for $\Lambda=0$. To this purpose we employ a diverse set of suitable operators, an anisotropic action, smearing techniques, and solve the generalized eigenvalue problem. We compare our findings with predictions from the Nambu-Goto string model to assess potential tensions indicative of novel phenomena such as the existence of axion-like state along the flux-tube world-sheet. Notably, we provide undoubted evidence of the existence of a massive axion-like particle with the same mass as the corresponding axion extracted within the context of closed flux-tube. This strengthens the conjecture that the axion is a property of the world-sheet of the QCD string.</description>

      <title>Obtaining continuum physics from dynamical simulations of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking the continuum limit is essential for extracting physical observables from quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories. Achieving the correct continuum limit requires careful control of all systematic uncertainties, including those arising from approximate implementations of the time evolution operator. In this work, we review existing approaches based on renormalization techniques, and point out their limitations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new general framework -- the Statistically-Bounded Time Evolution (SBTE) protocol -- for rigorously controlling the impact of approximate time evolution on the continuum limit. The central insight is that, since exact time evolution introduces no UV divergences, errors from approximate evolution can be treated as a source of systematic uncertainty that can be neglected if reduced below the working statistical uncertainty. We show that, using the SBTE protocol, which prescribes driving the approximate time evolution error below the working statistical uncertainty, leads to a simplified renormalization procedure. Furthermore, we show that, due to the existence of rigorous error bounds, one can guarantee a priori that such errors are negligible and do not affect the continuum limit. Ultimately, our protocol lays the foundation for performing systematic and fair comparisons between different simulation algorithms for lattice gauge theory simulations.</description>

      <title>Ill-Posedness in Limited Discrete Fourier Inversion and Regularization for Quasi Distributions in LaMET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigated the limited inverse discrete Fourier transform of the quasi distributions from the perspective of inverse problem theory. This transformation satisfies two of Hadamard's well-posedness criteria, existence and uniqueness of solutions, but critically violates the stability requirement, exhibiting exponential sensitivity to input perturbations. To address this instability, we implemented Tikhonov regularization with L-curve optimized parameters, demonstrating its validity for controlled toy model studies and real lattice QCD results of quasi distribution amplitudes. The reconstructed solutions is consistent with the physics-driven $\lambda$-extrapolation method. Our analysis demonstrates that the inverse Fourier problem within the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) framework belongs to a class of moderately tractable ill-posed problems, characterized by distinct spectral properties that differ from those of more severely unstable inverse problems encountered in other lattice QCD applications. Tikhonov regularization establishes a rigorous mathematical framework for addressing the underlying instability, enabling first-principles uncertainty quantification without relying on ansatz-based assumptions.</description>

      <title>Parton Distributions on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first quantum computation of parton distribution function (PDF) with a real quantum device by calculating the PDF of the lightest positronium in the Schwinger model with IBM quantum computers. The calculation uses 10 qubits for staggered fermions at five spatial sites and one ancillary qubit. The most critical and challenging step is to reduce the number of two-qubit gate depths to around 500 so that sensible results start to emerge. The resulting lightcone correlators have excellent agreement with the classical simulator result in central values, although the error is still large. Compared with classical approaches, quantum computation has the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact.</description>

      <title>Kinetic coupling and dark matter on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a $U(1)\otimes U(1)$ system coupled to scalar fields. Initially the model is studied in a novel continuum formulation and study of the appropriate diagonalizations is performed. Three models are examined, in two of which the scalar field couples with both gauge fields while in the third one the scalar field couples only to the dark photon. The model is then treated on a space-time lattice. We determine the phase diagram for various values of the kinetic coupling parameter. Then there follows the determination of masses for the scalar fields and the massive gauge fields, as well as the fine structure constants for the massless gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD study of the $\chi_{c1}\to J/\psi \, \gamma$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of our lattice QCD computation of the electric ($E_{1}$) and magnetic $(M_{2})$ form factors relevant to the $\chi_{c1}\to J/\psi\,\gamma$ decay by using the gauge field configurations produced by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration with $N_{f}=2+1+1$ dynamical Wilson-Clover twisted mass fermions at four different lattice spacings with physical dynamical $u$ , $d$, $s$ and $c$ quark masses (except for the coarsest lattice for which the lightest sea quark corresponds to a pion with $m_{\pi}\simeq 175~\mathrm{MeV}$). In the continuum limit, we obtain $\Gamma( \chi_{c1}\to J/\psi\ \gamma ) = 0.3265(79)~\mathrm{MeV}$, which agrees to $(1\div 2) \sigma$ with the experimental results and disagrees with a previous (unquenched) lattice QCD calculation. Our result for the magnetic quadrupole fractional transition amplitude, $a_{2} =M_{2}/\sqrt{E_{1}^{2}+M_{2}^{2}} = -0.0666(22)$, is in agreement with the experiment and represents an improvement by a factor of about $30$ with respect to the only existing (quenched) lattice QCD result.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Symmetries of Yang-Mills Theory in (3+1)-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that classical, non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories coupled to spin-1/2 and spin-0 elementary matter fields, in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski space-time, possess an exact integrability structure with an infinite number of conserved charges in involution. Such an integrability lives on the space of non-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and is based on flat connections in generalized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation. We present two novel symmetries of Yang-Mills theories. The first one corresponds to global transformations generated by the infinity of those conserved charges under the Poisson brackets. The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson lines and fluxes have interesting transformation laws under such a global symmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills equations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite dimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop space of functions from the circle $S^1$ to the space-time. Our approach certainly applies to the Standard Model of the Fundamental Interactions. The conserved charges are gauge invariant, and so, in the case of QCD they are color singlets, and perhaps are not confined. Therefore, the hadrons may carry such charges. Our results open up the way for the construction of non-perturbative methods for Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>Pseudocriticality in antiferromagnetic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak first-order pseudocriticality with approximate scale invariance has been observed in a variety of settings, including the intriguing case of deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. Recently, this has been interpreted as extremely slow flows ("walking behavior") for real-valued couplings in proximity to a bona fide critical point with complex-valued couplings, described by a complex conformal field theory (CFT). Here we study an SU($N$) generalization of the the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is a familiar model for deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in 1+1 dimensions the model is located near a complex CFT, whose proximity can be tuned as a function of $N$. We employ state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations for continuous $N$ along with an improved loop estimator for the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy based on a nonequilibrium work protocol. These techniques allow us to track the central charge of this model in detail as a function of $N$, where we observe excellent agreement with CFT predictions. Notably, this includes the region $N&gt;2$, where the CFT moves into the complex plane and pseudocritical drifts enable us to recover the real part of the complex central charge with remarkable accuracy. Since the present model with $N=3$ is also equivalent to the spin-1 biquadratic model, our work sheds new light on the dimerized phase of the spin-1 chain, demonstrating that it is pseudocritical and proximate to a complex CFT.</description>

Abstract: We present the first proof of principle that normalizing flows can accurately learn the Boltzmann distribution of the fermionic Hubbard model - a key framework for describing the electronic structure of graphene and related materials. State-of-the-art methods like Hybrid Monte Carlo often suffer from ergodicity issues near the time-continuum limit, leading to biased estimates. Leveraging symmetry-aware architectures as well as independent and identically distributed sampling, our approach resolves these issues and achieves significant speed-ups over traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Loop-string-hadron approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory: I. Hilbert space of a trivalent vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of gauge invariant states of SU(3) lattice gauge theories has garnered new interest in recent years, but implementing them is complicated by the need for SU(3) Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. In the loop-string-hadron (LSH) approach to lattice gauge theories, the elementary excitations are strictly gauge invariant, and constructing the basis requires no knowledge of Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. Originally developed for SU(2), the LSH formulation was recently generalized to SU(3), but limited to one spatial dimension. In this work, we generalize the LSH approach to constructing the basis of SU(3) gauge invariant states at a trivalent vertex -- the essential building block to multidimensional space. A direct generalization from the SU(2) vertex yields a legitimate basis; however, in certain sectors of the Hilbert space, the naive LSH basis vectors so defined suffer from being nonorthogonal. The issues with orthogonality are directly related to the "missing label" or "outer multiplicity" problem associated with SU(3) tensor products, and may also be phrased in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients or the need for a "seventh Casimir" operator. The states that are unaffected by the problem are orthonormalized in closed form. For the sectors that are afflicted, we discuss the nonorthogonal bases and their orthogonalization. A few candidates for seventh Casimir operators are readily constructed from the suite of LSH gauge-singlet operators. The diagonalization of a seventh Casimir represents one prescriptive solution toward obtaining a complete orthonormal basis, but a closed-form general solution remains to be found.</description>

      <title>Vortex wall phase in fractonic XY-plaquette model on square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The XY-plaquette model is the most straightforward lattice realization of a broad class of fractonic field theories that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility. The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.</description>

      <title>First Nucleon Gluon PDF from Large Momentum Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) using Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). We focus on the gluon operator which was demonstrated to have the best signal-to-noise in the previous attempt [1] in computing gluon PDFs using LaMET. We compute the corresponding Wilson coefficients needed for the hybrid-renormalized matrix elements and the matching kernel to convert the quasi-PDF to the lightcone one at the one-loop level. We demonstrate that with the proper Wilson coefficients in place, the counterterms for the renormalization are independent of the hadron and mass within statistical error. Using the resulting renormalization, we then compute the nucleon PDF using a HISQ ensemble generated by the MILC collaboration with $N_f=2+1+1$, $a \approx 0.12$ fm, with valence pion masses of 310 and 690 MeV and two gauge link smearing techniques. Despite the physics effects of the heavier than physical pion masses and gauge link smearing, this calculation provides excellent proof of principle and compares reasonably with selected global fit results.</description>

      <title>A realistic method to access heavy meson light-cone distribution amplitudes from first-principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of heavy meson within heavy quark effective theory (HQET) are crucial for predicting physical observables in $B$ decays, but unfortunately there is no first-principle result due to severe challenges. After analyzing these challenges, we propose a realistic method to determine heavy meson LCDA. We utilize equal-time correlations and incorporate a dynamic quark field for a fast moving heavy quark. To verify this method, we make use of lattice QCD simulation on a lattice ensemble with spacing $a = 0.05187$\,fm. The preliminary findings for HQET LCDAs qualitatively align with phenomenological models, and the fitted result for the first inverse moment $\lambda_B^{-1}$ is consistent with the experimentally constrain from $B \to \gamma \ell\nu_\ell$. We explore how our findings can reduce model uncertainties in predictions of heavy-to-light form factors at large recoil. These results demonstrate the promise of our method in providing first-principle predictions for heavy meson LCDAs.</description>

      <title>Effective range expansion with a long-range force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The validity range of the time-honored effective range expansion can be very limited due to the presence of a left-hand cut close to the two-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut arises in the two-particle interaction involving a light particle exchange with a mass small or slightly heavier than the mass difference of the two particles, identified as a long-range force, a scenario encountered in a broad range of systems. This can hinder a precise extraction of low-energy scattering observables and resonance poles. To address this issue, we propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that accounts for the left-hand cut. The parameterization is like a Pad\'e approximation but with nonanalytic terms from the left-hand cut and can be regarded as an extension of the effective range expansion. This parameterization is versatile and applicable to a broad range of systems with Yukawa-type interactions -- including particle, hadronic, nuclear, cold atom and quantum gas systems. In particular, it should be invaluable in understanding various near-threshold hadron resonances. As byproducts, we also show that the parameterization can be used to extract the couplings of the exchanged particle to the scattering particles, and derive expressions for amplitude zeros caused by the interplay between the short- and long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the axial-vector coupling constant $g_A$ to two loops in covariant chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the leading two-loop corrections to the axial-vector coupling constant $g_A$ in two covariant versions of two-flavor baryon chiral perturbation theory. Taking the low-energy constants from a combined analysis of elastic and inelastic pion-nucleon scattering, we find that these corrections are rather moderate.</description>

      <title>The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in the Standard Model: an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the current Standard Model (SM) prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $a_\mu$, updating the first White Paper (WP20) [1]. The pure QED and electroweak contributions have been further consolidated, while hadronic contributions continue to be responsible for the bulk of the uncertainty of the SM prediction. Significant progress has been achieved in the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution using both the data-driven dispersive approach as well as lattice-QCD calculations, leading to a reduction of the uncertainty by almost a factor of two. The most important development since WP20 is the change in the estimate of the leading-order hadronic-vacuum-polarization (LO HVP) contribution. A new measurement of the $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ cross section by CMD-3 has increased the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution to a level that makes it impossible to combine the results in a meaningful way. At the same time, the attainable precision of lattice-QCD calculations has increased substantially and allows for a consolidated lattice-QCD average of the LO HVP contribution with a precision of about 0.9%. Adopting the latter in this update has resulted in a major upward shift of the total SM prediction, which now reads $a_\mu^\text{SM} = 116\,592\,033(62)\times 10^{-11}$ (530 ppb). When compared against the current experimental average based on the E821 experiment and runs 1-6 of E989 at Fermilab, one finds $a_\mu^\text{exp} - a_\mu^\text{SM} =38(63)\times 10^{-11}$, which implies that there is no tension between the SM and experiment at the current level of precision. The final precision of E989 (127 ppb) is the target of future efforts by the Theory Initiative. The resolution of the tensions among data-driven dispersive evaluations of the LO HVP contribution will be a key element in this endeavor.</description>
