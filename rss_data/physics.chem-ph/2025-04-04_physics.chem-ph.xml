      <title>Universally applicable and tunable graph-based coarse-graining for Machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) force field methods for molecular systems are a crucial tool to simulate large biological macromolecules and are therefore essential for characterisations of biomolecular systems. While state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)-based models for all-atom force fields have improved immensely over recent years, we observe and analyse significant limitations of the currently available approaches for DL-based CG simulations. In this work, we present the first transferable DL-based CG force field approach (i.e., not specific to only one narrowly defined system type) applicable to a wide range of biosystems. To achieve this, our CG algorithm does not rely on hard-coded rules and is tuned to output coarse-grained systems optimised for minimal statistical noise in the ground truth CG forces, which results in significant improvement of model training. Our force field model is also the first CG variant that is based on the MACE architecture and is trained on a custom dataset created by a new approach based on the fragmentation of large biosystems covering protein, RNA and lipid chemistry. We demonstrate that our model can be applied in molecular dynamics simulations to obtain stable and qualitatively accurate trajectories for a variety of systems, while also discussing cases for which we observe limited reliability.</description>

      <title>From short-sighted to far-sighted: A comparative study of recursive machine learning approaches for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling open quantum system dynamics is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, yet traditional methods struggle to balance accuracy and efficiency. Machine learning (ML) provides a promising alternative, particularly through recursive models that predict system evolution based on past history. While these models have shown success in predicting single observables, their effectiveness in more complex tasks, such as forecasting the full reduced density matrix (RDM), remains unclear. We extend history-based recursive ML approaches to complex quantum systems, comparing four physics-informed neural network (PINN) architectures: (i) single-RDM-predicting PINN (SR-PINN), (ii) SR-PINN with simulation parameters (PSR-PINN), (iii) multi-RDMs-predicting PINN (MR-PINN), and (iv) MR-PINN with simulation parameters (PMR-PINN). These models are applied to the spin-boson (SB) model and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Our results show that SR-PINN and PSR-PINN, constrained by a narrow history window, fail to capture complex quantum evolution, leading to unstable long-term predictions, especially in nonlinear and highly correlated dynamics. In contrast, MR-PINN and PMR-PINN improve accuracy by extending the forecast horizon, incorporating long-range correlations, and reducing error propagation. Surprisingly, explicitly including simulation parameters such as temperature and reorganization energy in PSR-PINN and PMR-PINN does not consistently enhance accuracy and can even reduce performance, suggesting that these effects are already encoded in the RDM evolution. These findings highlight the limitations of short-sighted recursive forecasting and demonstrate the superior stability and accuracy of far-sighted approaches for long-term predictions.</description>

      <title>Super diffusive length dependent thermal conductivity in one-dimensional materials with structural defects: longitudinal to transverse phonon scattering leads to $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural defects in one-dimensional heat conductors couple longitudinal (stretching) and transverse (bending) vibrations. This coupling results in the scattering of longitudinal phonons to transverse phonons and backwards. We show that the decay rate of longitudinal phonons due to this scattering scales with their frequencies as $\omega^{3/2}$ within the long wavelength limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), which is more efficient scattering compared to the traditionally considered Rayleigh scattering within the longitudinal band ($\omega^2$). This scattering results in temperature independent thermal conductivity depending on the size as $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ for sufficiently long materials. This predicted length dependence is observed in nanowires, though the temperature dependence is seen there possibly because of deviations from pure one-dimensional behavior. The significant effect of interaction of longitudinal phonons with transverse phonons is consistent with the earlier observations of a substantial suppression of thermal energy transport by kinks, obviously leading to such interaction, though anharmonic interaction can also be significant.</description>

      <title>Negative and positive anisotropic thermal expansion in 2D fullerene networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular double bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy of N2O Solid Simulating the haze of trans-Neptunian objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \ Nitrous oxide (N$_2$O) ice is likely to exist in trans-Neptunian objects such as Pluto and Triton, potentially formed through ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun or cosmic ray irradiation of N$_2$ and CO ices. However, the mid-infrared spectral characteristics of N$_2$O ice in higher temperature regions (90-110 K), changes in mid-infrared spectra during UV irradiation, and the chemical network of nitrogen oxide (N$_x$O$_y$) ices remain insufficiently understood. This study aims to elucidate these aspects through in-situ mid-infrared spectral measurements of cryogenic particles using two-dimensional imaging Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
  Spectroscopic imaging confirmed strong absorption at 7.75 $\mu$m (N$_2$O $\nu_1$ vibrational mode), with weaker vibrational modes observed at 8.60 $\mu$m (N$_2$O 2$\nu_2$), 7.27 $\mu$m (N$_2$O torsion), and 5.29 $\mu$m (N$_2$O $\nu_1$+$\nu_2$). Annealing experiments simulating high-temperature conditions demonstrated that all vibrational modes irreversibly intensified with increasing temperature, indicating progressive crystallization. New spectral features appeared at approximately 12 $\mu$m and 14 $\mu$m at the condensed sample.
  N$_2$O ice was exposed to ultraviolet radiation (190-340 nm) using a D$_2$ lamp for 8.5 hours to investigate spectral changes during UV irradiation. After 60-90 minutes of irradiation, all N$_2$O vibrational modes disappeared, while absorption intensities of various nitrogen oxides, including NO, NO$_2$, N$_2$O$_3$, and O$_3$ increased. Beyond 180 minutes, vibrational modes of multiple nitrogen oxide ices exhibited intensity variations across different wavelengths, corresponding to other species such as cis-(NO)$_2$, N$_2$O$_4$, and N$_2$O$_5$.</description>

      <title>In situ and real-time ultrafast spectroscopy of photoinduced reactions in perovskite nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing two synchronized mode-locked femtosecond lasers and interferometric detection of the pump-probe spectra -- referred to as asynchronous and interferometric transient absorption (AI-TA) -- we have developed a method for broad dynamic range and rapid data acquisition. Using AI-TA, we examined photochemical changes during femtosecond pump-probe experiments on all-inorganic cesium lead halide nanomaterials, including perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) and nanoplatelets (PeNPLs). The laser pulse train facilitates photoreactions while allowing real-time observation of charge carrier dynamics. In PeNCs undergoing halide anion photo-substitution, transient absorption spectra showed increasing bandgap energy and faster relaxation dynamics as the Cl/Br ratio increased. For colloidal PeNPLs, continuous observation revealed both spectral and kinetic changes during the light-induced coalescence of nanoplatelets, by analyzing temporal segments. This integrated technique not only deepens understanding of exciton dynamics and environmental influences in perovskite nanomaterials but also establishes AI-TA as a transformative tool for real-time observation of photochemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid lunar ISRU plant: a comparative analysis with carbothermal reduction and water extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To establish a self-sustained human presence in space and to explore deeper into the solar system, extensive research has been conducted on In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems. Past studies have proposed and researched many technologies to produce oxygen from regolith, such as carbothermal reduction and water extraction from icy regolith, to utilize it for astronauts' life support and as the propellant of space systems. However, determining the most promising technology remains challenging due to uncertainties in the lunar environment and processing methods. To better understand the lunar environment and ISRU operations, it is crucial to gather more information. Motivated by this need for information gathering, this paper proposes a new ISRU plant architecture integrating carbothermal reduction of dry regolith and water extraction from icy regolith. Two different hybrid plant architectures integrating both technologies (1) in parallel and (2) in series are examined. The former involves mining and processing in both a Permanently Shadowed Region (PSR) and a peak of eternal light in parallel, while the latter solely mines in a PSR. In this series hybrid architecture, the dry regolith tailings from water extraction are further processed by carbothermal reduction. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of the landed mass and required power of each plant architecture utilizing subsystem-level models. Furthermore, based on uncertain parameters such as resource content in regolith, the potential performance range of each plant was discovered through Monte Carlo simulations. The result indicates the benefit of the series hybrid architecture in terms of regolith excavation rate, while its mass cost seems the highest among the studied architectures.</description>

      <title>QuantumBind-RBFE: Accurate Relative Binding Free Energy Calculations Using Neural Network Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is crucial in drug discovery, particularly during hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases, however, limitations in ligand force fields continue to impact prediction accuracy. In this work, we validate relative binding free energy (RBFE) accuracy using neural network potentials (NNPs) for the ligands. We utilize a novel NNP model, AceFF 1.0, based on the TensorNet architecture for small molecules that broadens the applicability to diverse drug-like compounds, including all important chemical elements and supporting charged molecules. Using established benchmarks, we show overall improved accuracy and correlation in binding affinity predictions compared with GAFF2 for molecular mechanics and ANI2-x for NNPs. Slightly less accuracy but comparable correlations with OPLS4. We also show that we can run the NNP simulations at 2 fs timestep, at least two times larger than previous NNP models, providing significant speed gains. The results show promise for further evolutions of free energy calculations using NNPs while demonstrating its practical use already with the current generation. The code and NNP model are publicly available for research use.</description>

      <title>Optimal Invariant Bases for Atomistic Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The representation of atomic configurations for machine learning models has led to the development of numerous descriptors, often to describe the local environment of atoms. However, many of these representations are incomplete and/or functionally dependent. Incomplete descriptor sets are unable to represent all meaningful changes in the atomic environment. Complete constructions of atomic environment descriptors, on the other hand, often suffer from a high degree of functional dependence, where some descriptors can be written as functions of the others. These redundant descriptors do not provide additional power to discriminate between different atomic environments and increase the computational burden. By employing techniques from the pattern recognition literature to existing atomistic representations, we remove descriptors that are functions of other descriptors to produce the smallest possible set that satisfies completeness. We apply this in two ways: first we refine an existing description, the Atomistic Cluster Expansion. We show that this yields a more efficient subset of descriptors. Second, we augment an incomplete construction based on a scalar neural network, yielding a new message-passing network architecture that can recognize up to 5-body patterns in each neuron by taking advantage of an optimal set of Cartesian tensor invariants. This architecture shows strong accuracy on state-of-the-art benchmarks while retaining low computational cost. Our results not only yield improved models, but point the way to classes of invariant bases that minimize cost while maximizing expressivity for a host of applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Based Voltage Prediction for Alkali-Metal-Ion Battery Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate voltage prediction of battery materials plays a pivotal role in advancing energy storage technologies and in the rational design of high-performance cathode materials. In this work, we present a deep neural network (DNN) model, built using PyTorch, to estimate the average voltage of cathode materials across Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. The model is trained on an extensive dataset from the Materials Project, incorporating a wide range of descriptors-structural, physical, chemical, electronic, thermodynamic, and battery-specific-ensuring a comprehensive representation of material properties. Our model exhibits strong predictive performance, as corroborated by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The close alignment between the DNN predictions and DFT outcomes highlights the robustness and accuracy of our machine learning framework in effectively screening and identifying viable battery materials. Utilizing this validated model, we successfully propose novel Na-ion battery compositions, with their predicted behavior confirmed through rigorous computational assessment. By seamlessly integrating data-driven prediction with first-principles validation, this study presents an effective framework that significantly accelerates the discovery and optimization of advanced battery materials, contributing to the development of more reliable and efficient energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity as the system enters the attractive regime, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics.</description>
