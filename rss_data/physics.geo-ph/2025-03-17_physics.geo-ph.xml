      <title>Reciprocity and representation theorems for rotational seismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in employing rotational motion measurements for seismic source inversion, structural imaging and ambient noise analysis. We derive reciprocity and representation theorems for rotational motion. The representations express the rotational motion inside an inhomogeneous anisotropic earth in terms of translational and rotational motion at the surface. The theorems contribute to the theoretical basis for rotational seismology methodology, such as determining the moment tensor of earthquake sources.</description>

      <title>2024 California Community Earth Models for Seismic Hazard Assessments Workshop Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The California Community Earth Models for Seismic Hazard Assessments Workshop (https://www.scec.org/workshops/2024/california-community-models, accessed December 16, 2024) was held online on March 4-5, 2024, with more than 200 participants over two days. In this report, we provide a summary of the key points from the presentations and discussions. We highlight three use cases that drive the development of community Earth models, present an inventory of existing community Earth models in California, summarize a few techniques for integrating and merging models, discuss potential connections with the Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center (CRESCENT), and discuss what "community" means in community Earth models. Appendix B contains the workshop agenda and Appendix C contains a list of participants.</description>

      <title>RNN-DAS: A New Deep Learning Approach for Detection and Real-Time Monitoring of Volcano-Tectonic Events Using Distributed Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel Deep Learning model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells, designed as a real-time Volcano-seismic Signal Recognition (VSR) system for Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) measurements. The model was trained on an extensive database of Volcano-Tectonic (VT) events derived from the co-eruptive seismicity of the 2021 La Palma eruption, recorded by a High-fidelity submarine Distributed Acoustic Sensing array (HDAS) near the eruption site. The features used for supervised model training, based on signal energy average in frequency bands, effectively enable the model to leverage spatial contextual information and the temporal evolution of volcano-seismic signals provided by the DAS technique. The proposed model not only detects the presence of VT events but also analyzes their temporal evolution, selecting and classifying their complete waveforms with an accuracy of approximately 97% for correctly detected and classified VT events. Furthermore, the model has demonstrated robust performance in generalizing to other time intervals and volcanoes, enabling continuous real-time monitoring of seismicity. Such results highlight the potential of using RNN-based approaches with LSTM cells for application to other active volcanoes, enabling fast, automatic analysis with low computational requirements and the need of minimal retraining, for the creation of labeled seismic catalogs directly from DAS measurements. This represents a significant advancement in the use of DAS technology as a viable tool to study active volcanoes and their seismic activity.</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Operator based surrogates for $CO_2$ storage in realistic geologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop surrogate models for accelerating decision making processes associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Selection of sub-surface $CO_2$ storage sites often necessitates expensive and involved simulations of $CO_2$ flow fields. Here, we develop a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based model for real-time, high-resolution simulation of $CO_2$ plume migration. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset generated from realistic subsurface parameters and offers $O(10^5)$ computational acceleration with minimal sacrifice in prediction accuracy. We also explore super-resolution experiments to improve the computational cost of training the FNO based models. Additionally, we present various strategies for improving the reliability of predictions from the model, which is crucial while assessing actual geological sites. This novel framework, based on NVIDIA's Modulus library, will allow rapid screening of sites for CCS. The discussed workflows and strategies can be applied to other energy solutions like geothermal reservoir modeling and hydrogen storage. Our work scales scientific machine learning models to realistic 3D systems that are more consistent with real-life subsurface aquifers/reservoirs, paving the way for next-generation digital twins for subsurface CCS applications.</description>

      <title>NH-rich organic compounds from the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu: nanoscale spectral and isotopic characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of spectral bands at 3.06 um by MicrOmega, combined with the chemical identification of other NH-containing organic molecules in Ryugu samples, suggests the presence of potential NH-bearing compounds. However, the chemical forms of these NH-rich compounds, whether associated with N-rich organics, ammonium (NH4+) salts, NH4 or NH-organics-bearing phyllosilicates, or other forms, remain to be better understood. In this study, we report the characterization of two Ryugu particles (C0050 and C0052) using multi-scale infrared (mm-reflectance, micro-FTIR, and nano-AFM-IR) and NanoSIMS techniques to constrain the nature and origin of NH-bearing components in the Ryugu asteroid. Our findings show that Ryugu's C0052 particle contains rare, micrometer-sized NH-rich organic compounds with peaks at 1660 cm-1 (mainly due to C=O stretching of the amide I band) and 1550 cm-1 (mainly due to N-H bending vibration mode of the amide II band), indicative of amide-related compounds. In contrast, these compounds are absent in C0050. Notably, nitrogen isotopic analysis reveals that these amides in C0052 are depleted in 15N (d15N = -215 +/- 92 permil), confirming their indigenous origin, while carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions are indistinguishable from terrestrial values within errors (d13C = -22 +/- 52 and dD = 194 +/- 368 permil). The amides detected in C0052 could have formed through hydrothermal alteration from carboxylic acids and amines precursors on the Ryugu's parent planetesimal. Alternatively, they could have originated from the irradiation of 15N-depleted N-bearing ice by UV light or galactic cosmic rays, either at the surface of the asteroid in the outer Solar System or on mantle of interstellar dust grains in the interstellar medium. Amides delivered to early Earth by primitive small bodies, such as asteroid Ryugu, may have played a crucial role in prebiotic chemistry.</description>
