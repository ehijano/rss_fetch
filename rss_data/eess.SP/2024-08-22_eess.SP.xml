      <title>DSP-MLIR: A MLIR Dialect for Digital Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Digital Signal Processing ( DSP ) compilers work at low level ( C-level / assembly level ) and hence lose much of the optimization opportunities present at high-level ( domain-level ). The emerging multi-level compiler infrastructure MLIR ( Multi-level Intermediate Representation ) allows to specify optimizations at higher level. In this paper, we utilize MLIR framework to introduce a DSP Dialect and perform domain-specific optimizations at dialect -level ( high-level ) and show the usefulness of these optimizations on sample DSP apps. In particular, we develop a compiler for DSP and a DSL (Domain Specific Language) to ease the development of apps. We show the performance improvement in execution time for these sample apps by upto 10x which would have been difficult if the IR were at C/ affine level.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Continuous-Aperture Array Communications: How to Learn Current Distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous aperture array (CAPA) can provide higher degree-of-freedom and spatial resolution than the spatially discrete array (SDPA), where optimizing multi-user current distributions in CAPA systems is crucial but challenging. The challenge arises from solving non-convex functional optimization problems without closed-form objective functions and constraints. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework called L-CAPA to learn current distribution policies. In the framework, we find finite-dimensional representations of channel functions and current distributions, allowing them to be inputted into and outputted from a deep neural network (DNN) for learning the policy. To address the issue that the integrals in the loss function without closed-form expressions hinder training the DNN in an unsupervised manner, we propose to design another two DNNs for learning the integrals. The DNNs are designed as graph neural networks to incorporate with the permutation properties of the mappings to be learned, thereby improving learning performance. Simulation results show that L-CAPA can achieve the performance upper-bound of optimizing precoding in the SDPA system as the number of antennas approaches infinity, and it is with low inference complexity.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preservation in Delay-Based Localization Systems: Artificial Noise or Artificial Multipath?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization plays an increasingly pivotal role in 5G/6G systems, enabling various applications. This paper focuses on the privacy concerns associated with delay-based localization, where unauthorized base stations attempt to infer the location of the end user. We propose a method to disrupt localization at unauthorized nodes by injecting artificial components into the pilot signal, exploiting model mismatches inherent in these nodes. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of two techniques, namely artificial multipath (AM) and artificial noise (AN), in mitigating location leakage. By leveraging the misspecified Cram\'er-Rao bound framework, we evaluate the impact of these techniques on unauthorized localization performance. Our results demonstrate that pilot manipulation significantly degrades the accuracy of unauthorized localization while minimally affecting legitimate localization. Moreover, we find that the superiority of AM over AN varies depending on the specific scenario.</description>

      <title>Channel Modeling Framework for Both Communications and Bistatic Sensing Under 3GPP Standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is considered a promising technology in the B5G/6G networks. The channel model is essential for an ISAC system to evaluate the communication and sensing performance. Most existing channel modeling studies focus on the monostatic ISAC channel. In this paper, the channel modeling framework for bistatic ISAC is considered. The proposed channel modeling framework extends the current 3GPP channel modeling framework and ensures the compatibility with the communication channel model. To support the bistatic sensing function, several key features for sensing are added. First, more clusters with weaker power are generated and retained to characterize the potential sensing targets. Second, the target model can be either deterministic or statistical, based on different sensing scenarios. Furthermore, for the statistical case, different reflection models are employed in the generation of rays, taking into account spatial coherence. The effectiveness of the proposed bistatic ISAC channel model framework is validated by both ray tracing simulations and experiment studies. The compatibility with the 3GPP communication channel model and how to use this framework for sensing evaluation are also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex ISAC-Enabled D2D Underlaid Cellular Networks: Joint Transceiver Beamforming and Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11329v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating device-to-device (D2D) communication into cellular networks can significantly reduce the transmission burden on base stations (BSs). Besides, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key feature in future wireless networks. In this work, we consider a full-duplex ISAC- based D2D underlaid system, and propose a joint beamforming and power allocation scheme to improve the performance of the coexisting ISAC and D2D networks. To enhance spectral efficiency, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated for the full-duplex ISAC-based D2D underlaid system, which is non-convex. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm and prove its convergence. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with the iterative algorithm, demonstrating that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art ones in both communication and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Flock: Enhancing Sets of Particles for Multi~Sub-State Particle Filtering with Neural Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A leading family of algorithms for state estimation in dynamic systems with multiple sub-states is based on particle filters (PFs). PFs often struggle when operating under complex or approximated modelling (necessitating many particles) with low latency requirements (limiting the number of particles), as is typically the case in multi target tracking (MTT). In this work, we introduce a deep neural network (DNN) augmentation for PFs termed learning flock (LF). LF learns to correct a particles-weights set, which we coin flock, based on the relationships between all sub-particles in the set itself, while disregarding the set acquisition procedure. Our proposed LF, which can be readily incorporated into different PFs flow, is designed to facilitate rapid operation by maintaining accuracy with a reduced number of particles. We introduce a dedicated training algorithm, allowing both supervised and unsupervised training, and yielding a module that supports a varying number of sub-states and particles without necessitating re-training. We experimentally show the improvements in performance, robustness, and latency of LF augmentation for radar multi-target tracking, as well its ability to mitigate the effect of a mismatched observation modelling. We also compare and illustrate the advantages of LF over a state-of-the-art DNN-aided PF, and demonstrate that LF enhances both classic PFs as well as DNN-based filters.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of Radar Range Deception Jamming Using Random Finite Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a radar target tracking framework for addressing main-beam range deception jamming attacks using random finite sets (RFSs). Our system handles false alarms and detections with false range information through multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) to resolve data association uncertainties. We focus on range gate pull-off (RGPO) attacks, where the attacker adds positive delays to the radar pulse, thereby mimicking the target trajectory while appearing at a larger distance from the radar. The proposed framework incorporates knowledge about the spatial behavior of the attack into the assumed RFS clutter model and uses only position information without relying on additional signal features. We present an adaptive solution that estimates the jammer-induced biases to improve tracking accuracy as well as a simpler non-adaptive version that performs well when accurate priors on the jamming range are available. Furthermore, an expression for RGPO attack detection is derived, where the adaptive solution offers superior performance. The presented strategies provide tracking resilience against multiple RGPO attacks in terms of position estimation accuracy and jamming detection without degrading tracking performance in the absence of jamming.</description>

      <title>Generative AI based Secure Wireless Sensing for ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is expected to be a key technology for 6G, and channel state information (CSI) based sensing is a key component of ISAC. However, current research on ISAC focuses mainly on improving sensing performance, overlooking security issues, particularly the unauthorized sensing of users. In this paper, we propose a secure sensing system (DFSS) based on two distinct diffusion models. Specifically, we first propose a discrete conditional diffusion model to generate graphs with nodes and edges, guiding the ISAC system to appropriately activate wireless links and nodes, which ensures the sensing performance while minimizing the operation cost. Using the activated links and nodes, DFSS then employs the continuous conditional diffusion model to generate safeguarding signals, which are next modulated onto the pilot at the transmitter to mask fluctuations caused by user activities. As such, only ISAC devices authorized with the safeguarding signals can extract the true CSI for sensing, while unauthorized devices are unable to achieve the same sensing. Experiment results demonstrate that DFSS can reduce the activity recognition accuracy of the unauthorized devices by approximately 70%, effectively shield the user from the unauthorized surveillance.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to combine spatial and spectral information from hyperspectral images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a generic framework to process jointly the spatial and spectral information of hyperspectral images. First, sub-images are extracted. Then each of these sub-images follows two parallel workflows, one dedicated to the extraction of spatial features and the other dedicated to the extraction of spectral features. Finally, the extracted features are merged, producing as many scores as sub-images. Two applications are proposed, illustrating different spatial and spectral processing methods. The first one is related to the characterization of a teak wood disk, in an unsupervised way. It implements tensors of structure for the spatial branch, simple averaging for the spectral branch and multi-block principal component analysis for the fusion process. The second application is related to the early detection of apple scab on leaves. It implements co-occurrence matrices for the spatial branch, singular value decomposition for the spectral branch and multiblock partial least squares discriminant analysis for the fusion process. Both applications demonstrate the interest of the proposed method for the extraction of relevant spatial and spectral information and show how promising this new approach is for hyperspectral imaging processing.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Signal Processing: Unleashing the Power of Proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After nearly a century of specialized applications in optics, remote sensing, and acoustics, the near-field (NF) electromagnetic propagation zone is experiencing a resurgence in research interest. This renewed attention is fueled by the emergence of promising applications in various fields such as wireless communications, holography, medical imaging, and quantum-inspired systems. Signal processing within NF sensing and wireless communications environments entails addressing issues related to extended scatterers, range-dependent beampatterns, spherical wavefronts, mutual coupling effects, and the presence of both reactive and radiative fields. Recent investigations have focused on these aspects in the context of extremely large arrays and wide bandwidths, giving rise to novel challenges in channel estimation, beamforming, beam training, sensing, and localization. While NF optics has a longstanding history, advancements in NF phase retrieval techniques and their applications have lately garnered significant research attention. Similarly, utilizing NF localization with acoustic arrays represents a contemporary extension of established principles in NF acoustic array signal processing. This article aims to provide an overview of state-of-the-art signal processing techniques within the NF domain, offering a comprehensive perspective on recent advances in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic Performance and Impact Analysis of a MEMS-Based Non-Invasive Monitoring System for Wind Turbine Blades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind power generation plays a crucial role in transitioning away from fossil fuel-dependent energy sources, contributing significantly to the mitigation of climate change. Monitoring and evaluating the aerodynamics of large wind turbine rotors is crucial to enable more wind energy deployment. This is necessary to achieve the European climate goal of a reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This paper presents a comparison between two measurement systems for evaluating the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine rotor blades on a full-scale wind tunnel test. One system uses an array of ten commercial compact ultra-low power micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) pressure sensors placed on the blade surface, while the other employs high-accuracy lab-based pressure scanners embedded in the airfoil. The tests are conducted at a Reynolds number of 3.5 x 10^6, which represents typical operating conditions for wind turbines. MEMS sensors are of particular interest, as they can enable real-time monitoring which would be impossible with the ground truth system. This work provides an accurate quantification of the impact of the MEMS system on the blade aerodynamics and its measurement accuracy. Our results indicate that MEMS sensors, with a total sensing power below 1.6 mW, can measure key aerodynamic parameters like Angle of Attack (AoA) and flow separation with a precision of 1{\deg}. Although there are minor differences in measurements due to sensor encapsulation, the MEMS system does not significantly compromise blade aerodynamics, with a maximum shift in the angle of attack for flow separation of only 1{\deg}. These findings indicate that surface and low-power MEMS sensor systems are a promising approach for efficient and sustainable wind turbine monitoring using self-sustaining Internet of Things devices and wireless sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Novel Many-to-Many NOMA-based Communication Protocols for Vehicular Platoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technique for ultra-reliable low-latency communication as it provides higher spectral efficiency and lower latency. In this work, we propose novel many-to-many (M2M) NOMA-based schemes to exchange broadcast, multicast, and unicast messages between cluster heads (CHs) of vehicular platoons. Specifically, we design uplink-M2M-NOMA (UM-NOMA), downlink-M2M-NOMA (DM-NOMA) and joint uplink-downlink-M2M-NOMA (UDM-NOMA) schemes for peer-to-peer vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). We propose a unique clustering design for full-duplex communication that utilizes the high throughput millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels. Furthermore, we investigate jointly optimal CH selection (CHS) and power allocation (PA) to maximize the network sum rate and devise a computationally efficient tailored-greedy algorithm that yields near-optimal performance. We also propose a super-cluster formation protocol to further limit the overhead of successive interference cancellation (SIC). The results reveal that in most of the considered scenarios, the proposed UDM-NOMA scheme outperforms orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in terms of sum rate by up to 50% even when the SIC receiver errors reach 10%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to interference detection in 5G New Radio (5G-NR) networks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Interference in 5G networks challenges high-quality service due to dense user equipment deployment and increased wireless environment complexity. Our CNN-based model is designed to detect Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) sequences amidst various interference scenarios, leveraging the spatial and temporal characteristics of PRACH signals to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Comprehensive datasets of simulated PRACH signals under controlled interference conditions were generated to train and validate the model. Experimental results show that our CNN-based approach outperforms traditional PRACH detection methods in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. This study demonstrates the potential of AI/ML techniques in advancing interference management in 5G networks, providing a foundation for future research and practical applications in optimizing network performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating S-Band Interference: Impact of Satellite Systems on Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The co-existence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) is essential for achieving global coverage in sixth-generation cellular networks. Due to increasing spectrum demand, there is discussion in the world level to share some frequencies used in terrestrial Networks (TNs) with NTNs, resulting in co-channel interference and performance degradation. This paper analyzes the interference caused by satellite networks on TN in the S-band. We examined the transmission mechanisms of satellite signals and conducted simulations to evaluate interference intensity across varying slant ranges. Our findings indicate that the angle between the user equipment direction and the sub-satellite point direction from the beam center significantly impacts the interference level.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Graph Error Control with Low Complexity in Causal Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the causal bandit problem is investigated, in which the objective is to select an optimal sequence of interventions on nodes in a causal graph. It is assumed that the graph is governed by linear structural equations; it is further assumed that both the causal topology and the distribution of interventions are unknown. By exploiting the causal relationships between the nodes whose signals contribute to the reward, interventions are optimized. First, based on the difference between the two types of graph identification errors (false positives and negatives), a causal graph learning method is proposed, which strongly reduces sample complexity relative to the prior art by learning sub-graphs. Under the assumption of Gaussian exogenous inputs and minimum-mean squared error weight estimation, a new uncertainty bound tailored to the causal bandit problem is derived. This uncertainty bound drives an upper confidence bound based intervention selection to optimize the reward. To cope with non-stationary bandits, a sub-graph change detection mechanism is proposed, with high sample efficiency. Numerical results compare the new methodology to existing schemes and show a substantial performance improvement in both stationary and non-stationary settings. Compared to existing approaches, the proposed scheme takes 67% fewer samples to learn the causal structure and achieves an average reward gain of 85%.</description>

      <title>Koopman AutoEncoder via Singular Value Decomposition for Data-Driven Long-Term Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman autoencoder, a data-driven technique, has gained traction for modeling nonlinear dynamics using deep learning methods in recent years. Given the linear characteristics inherent to the Koopman operator, controlling its eigenvalues offers an opportunity to enhance long-term prediction performance, a critical task for forecasting future trends in time-series datasets with long-term behaviors. However, controlling eigenvalues is challenging due to high computational complexity and difficulties in managing them during the training process. To tackle this issue, we propose leveraging the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Koopman matrix to adjust the singular values for better long-term prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that, during training, the loss term for singular values effectively brings the eigenvalues close to the unit circle, and the proposed approach outperforms existing baseline methods for long-term prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Just Project! Multi-Channel Despeckling, the Easy Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing speckle fluctuations in multi-channel SAR images is essential in many applications of SAR imaging such as polarimetric classification or interferometric height estimation. While single-channel despeckling has widely benefited from the application of deep learning techniques, extensions to multi-channel SAR images are much more challenging.This paper introduces MuChaPro, a generic framework that exploits existing single-channel despeckling methods. The key idea is to generate numerous single-channel projections, restore these projections, and recombine them into the final multi-channel estimate. This simple approach is shown to be effective in polarimetric and/or interferometric modalities. A special appeal of MuChaPro is the possibility to apply a self-supervised training strategy to learn sensor-specific networks for single-channel despeckling.</description>

      <title>RaNDT SLAM: Radar SLAM Based on Intensity-Augmented Normal Distributions Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rescue robotics sets high requirements to perception algorithms due to the unstructured and potentially vision-denied environments. Pivoting Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave radars are an emerging sensing modality for SLAM in this kind of environment. However, the complex noise characteristics of radar SLAM makes, particularly indoor, applications computationally demanding and slow. In this work, we introduce a novel radar SLAM framework, RaNDT SLAM, that operates fast and generates accurate robot trajectories. The method is based on the Normal Distributions Transform augmented by radar intensity measures. Motion estimation is based on fusion of motion model, IMU data, and registration of the intensity-augmented Normal Distributions Transform. We evaluate RaNDT SLAM in a new benchmark dataset and the Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset. The new dataset contains indoor and outdoor environments besides multiple sensing modalities (LiDAR, radar, and IMU).</description>

      <title>Active learning for efficient data selection in radio-signal based positioning via deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of user equipment (UE) positioning based on radio signals via deep learning. As in most supervised-learning tasks, a critical aspect is the availability of a relevant dataset to train a model. However, in a cellular network, the data-collection step may induce a high communication overhead. As a result, to reduce the required size of the dataset, it may be interesting to carefully choose the positions to be labelled and to be used in the training. We therefore propose an active learning approach for efficient data collection. We first show that significant gains (both in terms of positioning accuracy and size of the required dataset) can be obtained for the considered positioning problem using a genie. This validates the interest of active learning for positioning. We then propose a \textcolor{blue}{practical} method to approximate this genie.</description>

      <title>S4Sleep: Elucidating the design space of deep-learning-based sleep stage classification models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scoring sleep stages in polysomnography recordings is a time-consuming task plagued by significant inter-rater variability. Therefore, it stands to benefit from the application of machine learning algorithms. While many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, certain critical architectural decisions have not received systematic exploration. In this study, we meticulously investigate these design choices within the broad category of encoder-predictor architectures. We identify robust architectures applicable to both time series and spectrogram input representations. These architectures incorporate structured state space models as integral components and achieve statistically significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the extensive Sleep Heart Health Study dataset. We anticipate that the architectural insights gained from this study along with the refined methodology for architecture search demonstrated herein will not only prove valuable for future research in sleep staging but also hold relevance for other time series annotation tasks.</description>

      <title>Edge AI as a Service with Coordinated Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to expand in next-generation networks, there is a growing need for deep neural network (DNN) models. Although DNN models deployed at the edge are promising for providing AI as a service with low latency, their cooperation is yet to be explored. In this paper, we consider that DNN service providers share their computing resources as well as their models' parameters and allow other DNNs to offload their computations without mirroring. We propose a novel algorithm called coordinated DNNs on edge (\textbf{CoDE}) that facilitates coordination among DNN services by establishing new inference paths. CoDE aims to find the optimal path, which is the path with the highest possible reward, by creating multi-task DNNs from individual models. The reward reflects the inference throughput and model accuracy. With CoDE, DNN models can make new paths for inference by using their own or other models' parameters. We then evaluate the performance of CoDE through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate a $40\%$ increase in the inference throughput while degrading the average accuracy by only $2.3\%$. Experiments show that CoDE enhances the inference throughput and, achieves higher precision compared to a state-of-the-art existing method.</description>

      <title>Towards End-to-End GPS Localization with Neural Pseudorange Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pseudorange error is one of the root causes of localization inaccuracy in GPS. Previous data-driven methods regress and eliminate pseudorange errors using handcrafted intermediate labels. Unlike them, we propose an end-to-end GPS localization framework, E2E-PrNet, to train a neural network for pseudorange correction (PrNet) directly using the final task loss calculated with the ground truth of GPS receiver states. The gradients of the loss with respect to learnable parameters are backpropagated through a Differentiable Nonlinear Least Squares (DNLS) optimizer to PrNet. The feasibility of fusing the data-driven neural network and the model-based DNLS module is verified with GPS data collected by Android phones, showing that E2E-PrNet outperforms the baseline weighted least squares method and the state-of-the-art end-to-end data-driven approach. Finally, we discuss the explainability of E2E-PrNet.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Positioning Via Ray Tracing With Noisy Angle of Arrival Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00611v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the positioning problem in non line-of-sight (NLoS) situations, where several base stations (BS) try to locate a user equipment (UE) based on uplink angle of arrival (AoA) measurements and a digital twin of the environment. Ray launching in a Monte Carlo manner according to the AoA statistics enables to produce a map of points for each BS. These points represent the intersections of the rays with a xy plane at a given user equipment (UE) elevation. We propose to fit a parametric probability density function (pdf), such as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), to each map of points. Multiplying the obtained pdfs for each BS enables to compute the position probability of the UE. This approach yields an algorithm robust to a reduced number of launched rays. Moreover, these parametric pdfs may be fitted and stored in an offline phase such that ray tracing can be avoided in the online phase. This significantly reduces the computational complexity of the positioning method.</description>

      <title>OmniCount: Multi-label Object Counting with Semantic-Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05435v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object counting is pivotal for understanding the composition of scenes. Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open-vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights (priors) from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging varied interactive prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions.</description>

      <title>CrossFi: A Cross Domain Wi-Fi Sensing Framework Based on Siamese Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Wi-Fi sensing has garnered significant attention due to its numerous benefits, such as privacy protection, low cost, and penetration ability. Extensive research has been conducted in this field, focusing on areas such as gesture recognition, people identification, and fall detection. However, many data-driven methods encounter challenges related to domain shift, where the model fails to perform well in environments different from the training data. One major factor contributing to this issue is the limited availability of Wi-Fi sensing datasets, which makes models learn excessive irrelevant information and over-fit to the training set. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale Wi-Fi sensing datasets across diverse scenarios is a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose CrossFi, a siamese network-based approach that excels in both in-domain scenario and cross-domain scenario, including few-shot, zero-shot scenarios, and even works in few-shot new-class scenario where testing set contains new categories. The core component of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net, which improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention mechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the distance or cosine similarity. Based on it, we develop an extra Weight-Net that can generate a template for each class, so that our CrossFi can work in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CrossFi achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. In gesture recognition task, our CrossFi achieves an accuracy of 98.17% in in-domain scenario, 91.72% in one-shot cross-domain scenario, 64.81% in zero-shot cross-domain scenario, and 84.75% in one-shot new-class scenario. To facilitate future research, we will release the code for our model upon publication.</description>
