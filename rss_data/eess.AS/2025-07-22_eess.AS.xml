      <title>Distributed Asynchronous Device Speech Enhancement via Windowed Cross-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of microphone-equipped personal devices offers great flexibility and potential using them as ad-hoc microphone arrays in dynamic meeting environments. However, most existing approaches are designed for time-synchronized microphone setups, a condition that may not hold in real-world meeting scenarios, where time latency and clock drift vary across devices. Under such conditions, we found transform-average-concatenate (TAC), a popular module for neural multi-microphone processing, insufficient in handling time-asynchronous microphones. In response, we propose a windowed cross-attention module capable of dynamically aligning features between all microphones. This module is invariant to both the permutation and the number of microphones and can be easily integrated into existing models. Furthermore, we propose an optimal training target for multi-talker environments. We evaluated our approach in a multi-microphone noisy reverberant setup with unknown time latency and clock drift of each microphone. Experimental results show that our method outperforms TAC on both iFaSNet and CRUSE models, offering faster convergence and improved learning, demonstrating the efficacy of the windowed cross-attention module for asynchronous microphone setups.</description>

      <title>An approach to measuring the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models in the context of Large Language Model (LLM) powered applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) plays a crucial role in human-machine interaction and serves as an interface for a wide range of applications. Traditionally, ASR performance has been evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER), a metric that quantifies the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions in the generated transcriptions. However, with the increasing adoption of large and powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core processing component in various applications, the significance of different types of ASR errors in downstream tasks warrants further exploration. In this work, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to correct errors introduced by ASRs and propose a new measure to evaluate ASR performance for LLM-powered applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Framework for Speech Bandwidth Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering high-frequency components lost to bandwidth constraints is crucial for applications ranging from telecommunications to high-fidelity audio on limited resources. We introduce NDSI-BWE, a new adversarial Band Width Extension (BWE) framework that leverage four new discriminators inspired by nonlinear dynamical system to capture diverse temporal behaviors: a Multi-Resolution Lyapunov Discriminator (MRLD) for determining sensitivity to initial conditions by capturing deterministic chaos, a Multi-Scale Recurrence Discriminator (MS-RD) for self-similar recurrence dynamics, a Multi-Scale Detrended Fractal Analysis Discriminator (MSDFA) for long range slow variant scale invariant relationship, a Multi-Resolution Poincar\'e Plot Discriminator (MR-PPD) for capturing hidden latent space relationship, a Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD) for cyclical patterns, a Multi-Resolution Amplitude Discriminator (MRAD) and Multi-Resolution Phase Discriminator (MRPD) for capturing intricate amplitude-phase transition statistics. By using depth-wise convolution at the core of the convolutional block with in each discriminators, NDSI-BWE attains an eight-times parameter reduction. These seven discriminators guide a complex-valued ConformerNeXt based genetor with a dual stream Lattice-Net based architecture for simultaneous refinement of magnitude and phase. The genertor leverage the transformer based conformer's global dependency modeling and ConvNeXt block's local temporal modeling capability. Across six objective evaluation metrics and subjective based texts comprises of five human judges, NDSI-BWE establishes a new SoTA in BWE.</description>

      <title>SDBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark Suite for Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems exhibit high variance in error rates across different datasets, representing numerous use cases and domains. Furthermore, comparing across systems requires careful application of best practices such as dataset splits and metric definitions to allow for apples-to-apples comparison. We propose SDBench (Speaker Diarization Benchmark), an open-source benchmark suite that integrates 13 diverse datasets with built-in tooling for consistent and fine-grained analysis of speaker diarization performance for various on-device and server-side systems. SDBench enables reproducible evaluation and easy integration of new systems over time. To demonstrate the efficacy of SDBench, we built SpeakerKit, an inference efficiency-focused system built on top of Pyannote v3. SDBench enabled rapid execution of ablation studies that led to SpeakerKit being 9.6x faster than Pyannote v3 while achieving comparable error rates. We benchmark 6 state-of-the-art systems including Deepgram, AWS Transcribe, and Pyannote AI API, revealing important trade-offs between accuracy and speed.</description>

      <title>LABNet: A Lightweight Attentive Beamforming Network for Ad-hoc Multichannel Microphone Invariant Real-Time Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multichannel speech enhancement (SE) aims to restore clean speech from noisy measurements by leveraging spatiotemporal signal features. In ad-hoc array conditions, microphone invariance (MI) requires systems to handle different microphone numbers and array geometries. From a practical perspective, multichannel recordings inevitably increase the computational burden for edge-device applications, highlighting the necessity of lightweight and efficient deployments. In this work, we propose a lightweight attentive beamforming network (LABNet) to integrate MI in a low-complexity real-time SE system. We design a three-stage framework for efficient intra-channel modeling and inter-channel interaction. A cross-channel attention module is developed to aggregate features from each channel selectively. Experimental results demonstrate our LABNet achieves impressive performance with ultra-light resource overhead while maintaining the MI, indicating great potential for ad-hoc array processing.</description>

      <title>TTMBA: Towards Text To Multiple Sources Binaural Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing text-to-audio (TTA) generation methods produce mono outputs, neglecting essential spatial information for immersive auditory experiences. To address this issue, we propose a cascaded method for text-to-multisource binaural audio generation (TTMBA) with both temporal and spatial control. First, a pretrained large language model (LLM) segments the text into a structured format with time and spatial details for each sound event. Next, a pretrained mono audio generation network creates multiple mono audios with varying durations for each event. These mono audios are transformed into binaural audios using a binaural rendering neural network based on spatial data from the LLM. Finally, the binaural audios are arranged by their start times, resulting in multisource binaural audio. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both audio generation quality and spatial perceptual accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Step-Audio~2, an end-to-end multi-modal large language model designed for industry-strength audio understanding and speech conversation. By integrating a latent audio encoder and reasoning-centric reinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 achieves promising performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio understanding. To facilitate genuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the generation of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly enhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking styles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic knowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to mitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions of hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and expressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various audio understanding and conversational benchmarks compared to other open-source and commercial solutions.

      <title>SALM: Spatial Audio Language Model with Structured Embeddings for Understanding and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial audio understanding is essential for accurately perceiving and interpreting acoustic environments. However, existing audio-language models struggle with processing spatial audio and perceiving spatial acoustic scenes. We introduce the Spatial Audio Language Model (SALM), a novel framework that bridges spatial audio and language via multi-modal contrastive learning. SALM consists of a text encoder and a dual-branch audio encoder, decomposing spatial sound into semantic and spatial components through structured audio embeddings. Key features of SALM include seamless alignment of spatial and text representations, separate and joint extraction of spatial and semantic information, zero-shot direction classification and robust support for spatial audio editing. Experimental results demonstrate that SALM effectively captures and aligns cross-modal representations. Furthermore, it supports advanced editing capabilities, such as altering directional audio using text-based embeddings.</description>

      <title>ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo. We provide the dataset and the evaluation code at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AaronZ345/MRSDrama and https://github.com/AaronZ345/ISDrama.</description>

      <title>MDDM: A Multi-view Discriminative Enhanced Diffusion-based Model for Speech Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of deep learning, speech enhancement has been greatly optimized in terms of speech quality. Previous methods typically focus on the discriminative supervised learning or generative modeling, which tends to introduce speech distortions or high computational cost. In this paper, we propose MDDM, a Multi-view Discriminative enhanced Diffusion-based Model. Specifically, we take the features of three domains (time, frequency and noise) as inputs of a discriminative prediction network, generating the preliminary spectrogram. Then, the discriminative output can be converted to clean speech by several inference sampling steps. Due to the intersection of the distributions between discriminative output and clean target, the smaller sampling steps can achieve the competitive performance compared to other diffusion-based methods. Experiments conducted on a public dataset and a realworld dataset validate the effectiveness of MDDM, either on subjective or objective metric.</description>

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence raises concerns related to energy consumption, copyright infringement and creative atrophy. We show that randomly initialized recurrent neural networks can produce arpeggios and low-frequency oscillations that are rich and configurable. In contrast to end-to-end music generation that aims to replace musicians, our approach expands their creativity while requiring no data and much less computational power.

      <title>Audio Geolocation: A Natural Sounds Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can we determine someone's geographic location purely from the sounds they hear? Are acoustic signals enough to localize within a country, state, or even city? We tackle the challenge of global-scale audio geolocation, formalize the problem, and conduct an in-depth analysis with wildlife audio from the iNatSounds dataset. Adopting a vision-inspired approach, we convert audio recordings to spectrograms and benchmark existing image geolocation techniques. We hypothesize that species vocalizations offer strong geolocation cues due to their defined geographic ranges and propose an approach that integrates species range prediction with retrieval-based geolocation. We further evaluate whether geolocation improves when analyzing species-rich recordings or when aggregating across spatiotemporal neighborhoods. Finally, we introduce case studies from movies to explore multimodal geolocation using both audio and visual content. Our work highlights the advantages of integrating audio and visual cues, and sets the stage for future research in audio geolocation.</description>

      <title>Omni-Router: Sharing Routing Decisions in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call this model Omni-router Transformer. Extensive experiments on a large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse, out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness to diverse data.</description>

      <title>Music-Aligned Holistic 3D Dance Generation via Hierarchical Motion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Well-coordinated, music-aligned holistic dance enhances emotional expressiveness and audience engagement. However, generating such dances remains challenging due to the scarcity of holistic 3D dance datasets, the difficulty of achieving cross-modal alignment between music and dance, and the complexity of modeling interdependent motion across the body, hands, and face. To address these challenges, we introduce SoulDance, a high-precision music-dance paired dataset captured via professional motion capture systems, featuring meticulously annotated holistic dance movements. Building on this dataset, we propose SoulNet, a framework designed to generate music-aligned, kinematically coordinated holistic dance sequences. SoulNet consists of three principal components: (1) Hierarchical Residual Vector Quantization, which models complex, fine-grained motion dependencies across the body, hands, and face; (2) Music-Aligned Generative Model, which composes these hierarchical motion units into expressive and coordinated holistic dance; (3) Music-Motion Retrieval Module, a pre-trained cross-modal model that functions as a music-dance alignment prior, ensuring temporal synchronization and semantic coherence between generated dance and input music throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulNet significantly surpasses existing approaches in generating high-quality, music-coordinated, and well-aligned holistic 3D dance sequences.</description>
