      <title>Computation of the index on orbifold from the Atiyah-Segal-Singer fixed point theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the independent chiral zero modes on the orbifolds from the Atiyah-Segal-Singer fixed point theorem. The required information for this calculation includes the fixed points of the orbifold and the manner in which the spatial symmetries act on these points, unlike previous studies that necessitated the calculation of zero modes. Since the fixed point theorem can be applied to any fermionic theory on any orbifold, it allows us to determine the index even on orbifolds where the calculation of zero modes is challenging or in the presence of non-trivial gauge configurations.
  We compute the indices on the $T^{2}/ \mathbb{Z}_N\,(N=2,3,4,6)$ and $T^{4}/ \mathbb{Z}_N\,(N=2,3,5)$ as examples. Furthermore, we also attempt to compute the indices on a Coxeter orbifold related to the $D_4$ lattice.</description>

      <title>Unique multistable states in periodic structures with saturable nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report that conventional saturable periodic structures, in sharp contrast to the conventional systems with different nonlinearities which exhibit the typical S- shaped optical bi- and multi-stable states, reveal some unusual and unique nonlinear dynamics. These include the onset of ramp-like optical bistability (OB) and optical multistability (OM) curves which further transit into mixed OM states combining both ramp-like states followed by the S-shaped multistable curves. We also extend this study to another domain of physics, namely parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)- symmetry, by including equal amount of gain and loss into the system which then establishes additional degree of freedom by enabling the investigation into additional two domains which are the unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$- symmetric regimes. Although these bi- and multi-stable states are unusual and unique, when the frequency detuning is introduced, the revival of S-shaped stable states is possible but only in the presence of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$- symmetry. Conversely, the broken $\mathcal{PT}$- symmetry which usually generates ramp-like multistable states, gives rise to the birth of novel multistable states with a vortex like envelope, (the curve that features simultaneous increase in the critical switch-up and switch-down powers with an increase in the input power) causing a novel structure which has not been reported in the existing literature of different physical systems manifesting multi-stable states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Effect in Noisy Integrable Quantum Circuits for Impurity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the open quantum system dynamics (in the Trotterized limit) of integrable quantum circuits in the presence of onsite dephasing noise with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity interacting at the edge. Using a combination of Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of both the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains in the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \ll 1/\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of complex Hadamard matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the $6\times 6$ complex Hadamard matrices (CHMs) is an open problem in linear algebra and quantum information. In this paper, we investigate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of CHMs. We show that any $n\times n$ CHM with dephased form has two constant eigenvalues $\pm\sqrt{n}$ and has two constant eigenvectors. We obtain the maximum numbers of identical eigenvalues of $6\times 6$ CHMs with dephased form and we extend this result to arbitrary dimension. We also show that there is no $6\times 6$ CHM with four identical eigenvalues. We conjecture that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $6\times 6$ CHMs will lead to the complete classification of $6\times 6$ CHMs.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Symmetry-Protected Signature of 3-body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and characterizing multi-body interactions in quantum processes remains a significant challenge. This is partly because 2-body interactions can produce an arbitrary time evolution, a fundamental fact often called the universality of 2-local gates in the context of quantum computing. However, when an unknown Hamiltonian respects a U(1) symmetry such as charge or particle number conservation, N-body interactions exhibit a distinct symmetry-protected signature known as the N-body phase, which fewer-body interactions cannot mimic. We develop and demonstrate an efficient technique for the detection of 3-body interactions despite the presence of unknown 2-body interactions. This technique, which takes advantage of GHZ states for phase estimation, requires probing the unitary evolution and measuring its determinant in a small subspace that scales linearly with the system size, making it an efficient approach.</description>

      <title>First return times on sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation with Space Contributions Embedded in a Quantum-Corrected Gravitational Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the interface between curved spacetime quantum mechanics and applications in space quantum communications, quantum technologies and quantum optics, the Dirac equation is considered with the recently proposed generalized gravitational interaction (Kepler or Coulomb), which includes post-Newtonian (relativistic) and quantum corrections to the classical potential. The general idea in choosing the metric is that the spacetime contributions are contained in an external potential or in an electromagnetic potential which can be considered as a good basis for future studies on space quantum communication. We also discuss several known generalizations of the Coulomb potential within this formulation in terms of certain Heun functions. The impossibility of solving our equation for the quantum-corrected Coulomb terms using known exact or quasi-exact nonperturbative analytical techniques is discussed, and finally the Bethe-ansatz approach is proposed to overcome this challenging problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study massless solutions to the Einstein equations coupled to different matter models with a magnetic field and a conformal gauge singularity assuming spatial homogeneity with three commuting spatial translations. We show that there are no solutions in the case that the matter model is a radiation fluid. If the matter is described via kinetic theory we obtain that there exist unique solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system and the Einstein-Boltzmann system for a certain range of soft potentials. For both the Vlasov and the Boltzmann case we also obtain asymptotic expansions close to the initial conformal gauge singularity.</description>

      <title>Connection between coherent states and some integrals and integral representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents an interesting mathematical feedback between the formalism of coherent states and the field of integrals and integral representations involving special functions. This materializes through an easy and fast method to calculate integrals or integral representations of different functions, expressible by means of Meijer's G-, as well as hypergeometric generalized functions. The feedback starts from a fundamental integral that comes from the decomposition of the unity operator in the language of coherent states from quantum mechanics. In this way, integrals and integral representations are obtained, some that do not appear in the literature, and others already known, which can be verified by orthodox methods. All calculations are made using the properties of the diagonal operators ordering technique (DOOT), a relatively new technique of normal ordering of the creation and annihilation operators in quantum mechanics. The paper contributes to increasing the number of solvable integrals involving special functions.</description>

      <title>Framework for uncertainty quantification of wave-structure interaction in a flume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a numerical procedure for the quantification of uncertainties in wave-structure interaction. We utilise the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme for modelling the wave mechanics, coupled one-way with a finite element method (FEM) for the structural response. Physical wave flumes are extensively used in the study of hydrodynamics especially in wave-structure interaction (WSI) and prediction of forces to near-shore structures in disaster mitigation and offshore structures in the oil and gas, and more recently renewable energy sector. Over the years, numerical wave flumes have been developed extensively to enable the modelling of complex wave-structure interaction. However, most of these studies are deterministic and limited to using either simple flexible beams or rigid monolithic structures to model the structural part in the WSI. Additionally, uncertainties are commonly observed in both wave and structural parameters and need to be accounted for. This work presents a numerical framework to enable uncertainty quantification for wave-structure interaction problems in terms of the forces experienced by the structure. A one-way coupling between SPH with the FEM and uncertainty quantification (UQ) is proposed. We employ the so-called Tokyo wave flume geometry, which has potential for future surrogate modelling in WSI. The developed model is validated using numerical and experimental results from the literature and is used to demonstrate the prediction of probabilistic responses of structures under breaking and non-breaking wave scenarios.</description>

      <title>The high resolution sampling methods for acoustic sources from multi-frequency far field patterns at sparse observation directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to novel uniqueness results and high resolution sampling methods for source support from multi-frequency sparse far field patterns. With a single pair of observation directions $\pm\hat{x}$, we prove that the lines $\{z\in\mathbb R^2|\, \hat{x}\cdot z = \hat{x}\cdot y, \,y\in A_{\hat{x}}\}$ can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at the directions $\pm\hat{x}$, where $A_{\hat{x}}$ denotes a set containing the corners of the boundary and points whose normal vector to the boundary is parallel to $\hat{x}$. Furthermore, if the source support is composed of polygons and annuluses, then we prove that the support can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at sparse directions. Precisely, the lowest number of the observation directions is given in terms of the number of the corners and the annuluses. Inspired by the uniqueness arguments, we introduce two novel indicators to determine the source support. Numerical examples in two dimensions are presented to show the validity and robustness of the two indicators for reconstructing the boundaries of the source support with a high resolution. The second indicator also shows its powerful ability to determine the unknown source function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of KPZ equation scaling limits arising from directed random walk models in random media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalized model of random walk in dynamical random environment, and we show that the multiplicative-noise stochastic heat equation (SHE) describes the fluctuations of the quenched density at a certain precise location in the tail. The distribution of transition kernels is fixed rather than changing under the diffusive rescaling of space-time, i.e., there is no critical tuning of the model parameters when scaling to the stochastic PDE limit. The proof is done by pushing the methods developed in [arxiv 2304.14279, arXiv 2311.09151] to their maximum, substantially weakening the assumptions and obtaining fairly sharp conditions under which one expects to see the SHE arise in a wide variety of random walk models in random media. In particular we are able to get rid of conditions such as nearest-neighbor interaction as well as spatial independence of quenched transition kernels. Moreover, we observe an entire hierarchy of moderate deviation exponents at which the SHE can be found, confirming a physics prediction of J. Hass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the cubic Schrodinger equation on the line, for which the scattering theory requires modifications due to long range effects. We revisit the construction of the modified wave operator, and recall the construction of its inverse, in order to describe the asymptotic behavior of these operators near the origin. At leading order, these operators, whose definition includes a nonlinear modification in the phase compared to the linear dynamics, correspond to the identity. We compute explicitly the first corrector in the asymptotic expansion, and justify this expansion by error estimates.</description>

      <title>Modelling of planetary accretion and core-mantle structure formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We advance a thermodynamically consistent model of self-gravitational accretion and differentiation in planets. The system is modeled in actual variables as a compressible thermoviscoelastic fluid in a fixed, sufficiently large domain. The supply of material to the accreting and differentiating system is described as a bulk source of mass, volume, impulse, and energy localized in some border region of the domain. Mass, momentum, and energy conservation, along with constitutive relations, result in an extended compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier-Poisson system. After studying some single-component setting, we consider a two-component situation, where metals and silicates mix and differentiate under gravity, eventually forming a core-mantle structure. The energetics of the models are elucidated. Moreover, we prove that the models are stable, in that self-gravitational collapse is excluded. Eventually, we comment on the prospects of devising a rigorous mathematical approximation and existence theory.</description>

      <title>The directed landscape from Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an almost sure bijection which constructs the directed landscape from a sequence of infinitely many independent Brownian motions. This is the analogue of the RSK correspondence in this setting. The Brownian motions arise as a marginal of the extended Busemann process for the directed landscape, and the inverse map gives an explicit and natural coupling where Brownian last passage percolation converges in probability to the directed landscape. We use this map to prove that the directed landscape on a strip can be reconstructed from the Airy line ensemble. Along the way, we describe two more new versions of RSK in the semi-discrete setting, build a general theory of sorting via Pitman operators, and construct extended Busemann processes for the directed landscape and Brownian last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>The integration problem for principal connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Integration Problem for principal connections. Just as a principal connection on a principal bundle $\phi:Q\rightarrow M$ may be used to split $TQ$ into horizontal and vertical subbundles, a discrete connection may be used to split $Q\times Q$ into horizontal and vertical submanifolds. All discrete connections induce a connection on the same principal bundle via a process known as the Lie or derivative functor. The Integration Problem consists of describing, for a principal connection $\mathcal{A}$, the set of all discrete connections whose associated connection is $\mathcal{A}$. Our first result is that for \emph{flat} principal connections, the Integration Problem has a unique solution among the \emph{flat} discrete connections. More broadly, under a fairly mild condition on the structure group $G$ of the principal bundle $\phi$, we prove that the existence part of the Integration Problem has a solution that needs not be unique. Last, we see that, when $G$ is abelian, given compatible continuous and discrete curvatures the Integration Problem has a unique solution constrained by those curvatures.</description>

      <title>Exchangeable arrays and integrable systems for characteristic polynomials of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The joint moments of the derivatives of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix, and also a variant of the characteristic polynomial that is real on the unit circle, in the large matrix size limit, have been studied intensively in the past twenty five years, partly in relation to conjectural connections to the Riemann zeta-function and Hardy's function. We completely settle the most general version of the problem of convergence of these joint moments, after they are suitably rescaled, for an arbitrary number of derivatives and with arbitrary positive real exponents. Our approach relies on a hidden, higher-order exchangeable structure, that of an exchangeable array. Using these probabilistic techniques, we then give a combinatorial formula for the leading order coefficient in the asymptotics of the joint moments, when the power on the characteristic polynomial itself is a positive real number and the exponents of the derivatives are integers, in terms of a finite number of finite-dimensional integrals which are explicitly computable. Finally, we develop a method, based on a class of Hankel determinants shifted by partitions, that allows us to give an exact representation of all these joint moments, for finite matrix size, in terms of derivatives of Painlev\'e V transcendents, and then for the leading order coefficient in the large-matrix limit in terms of derivatives of solutions of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III' equation. Equivalently, we can represent all the joint moments of power sum linear statistics of a certain determinantal point process behind this problem in terms of derivatives of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III' transcendents. This gives an efficient way to compute all these quantities explicitly. Our methods can be used to obtain analogous results for a number of other models sharing the same features.</description>

      <title>Character Complexity: A Novel Measure for Quantum Circuit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, quantifying circuit complexity remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces Character Complexity, a novel measure that bridges Group-theoretic concepts with practical quantum computing concerns. By leveraging tools from representation theory, I prove several key properties of character complexity and establish a surprising connection to the classical simulability of quantum circuits. This new measure offers a fresh perspective on the complexity landscape of quantum algorithms, potentially reshaping our understanding of quantum-classical computational boundaries. I present innovative visualization methods for character complexity, providing intuitive insights into the structure of quantum circuits. The empirical results reveal intriguing scaling behaviors with respect to qubit and gate counts, opening new avenues for quantum algorithm design and optimization. This work not only contributes to the theoretical foundations of quantum complexity but also offers practical tools for the quantum computing community. As quantum hardware continues to advance, character complexity could play a crucial role in developing more efficient quantum algorithms and in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>
