      <title>Towards Practical First-Order Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order model counting (FOMC) is the problem of counting the number of models of a sentence in first-order logic. Since lifted inference techniques rely on reductions to variants of FOMC, the design of scalable methods for FOMC has attracted attention from both theoreticians and practitioners over the past decade. Recently, a new approach based on first-order knowledge compilation was proposed. This approach, called Crane, instead of simply providing the final count, generates definitions of (possibly recursive) functions that can be evaluated with different arguments to compute the model count for any domain size. However, this approach is not fully automated, as it requires manual evaluation of the constructed functions. The primary contribution of this work is a fully automated compilation algorithm, called Gantry, which transforms the function definitions into C++ code equipped with arbitrary-precision arithmetic. These additions allow the new FOMC algorithm to scale to domain sizes over 500,000 times larger than the current state of the art, as demonstrated through experimental results.</description>

      <title>Rational Capability in Concurrent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend concurrent game structures (CGSs) with a simple notion of preference over computations and define a minimal notion of rationality for agents based on the concept of dominance. We use this notion to interpret a CL and an ATL languages that extend the basic CL and ATL languages with modalities for rational capability, namely, a coalition's capability to rationally enforce a given property. For each of these languages, we provide results about the complexity of satisfiability checking and model checking as well as about axiomatization.</description>

      <title>Logic and Computation Through the Lens of Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study computational aspects of first-order logic and its extensions in the semiring semantics developed by Gr\"adel and Tannen. We characterize the complexity of model checking and data complexity of first-order logic both in terms of a generalization of BSS-machines and arithmetic circuits defined over $K$. In particular, we give a logical characterization of $\mathrm{FAC}^0_{K}$ by an extension of first-order logic that holds for any $K$ that is both commutative and positive.</description>

      <title>Classical notions of computation and the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spirit of the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, we define and study a syntax and semantics for classical logic equipped with a computationally involutive negation, using a polarised effect calculus. A main challenge in designing a denotational semantics is to accommodate both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation strategies, which leads to a failure of associativity of composition. Building on the work of the third author, we devise the notion of dialogue duploid, which provides a non-associative and effectful counterpart to the notion of dialogue category introduced by the second author in his 2-categorical account, based on adjunctions, of logical polarities and continuations. We show that the syntax of the polarised calculus can be interpreted in any dialogue duploid, and that it defines in fact a syntactic dialogue duploid. As an application, we establish, by semantic as well as syntactic means, the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem, which states that the notions of central map and of thunkable map coincide in any dialogue duploid (in particular, for any double negation monad on a symmetric monoidal category).</description>

      <title>On the Computational Tractability of the (Many) Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have examined the computational complexity of computing Shapley additive explanations (also known as SHAP) across various models and distributions, revealing their tractability or intractability in different settings. However, these studies primarily focused on a specific variant called Conditional SHAP, though many other variants exist and address different limitations. In this work, we analyze the complexity of computing a much broader range of such variants, including Conditional, Interventional, and Baseline SHAP, while exploring both local and global computations. We show that both local and global Interventional and Baseline SHAP can be computed in polynomial time for various ML models under Hidden Markov Model distributions, extending popular algorithms such as TreeSHAP beyond empirical distributions. On the downside, we prove intractability results for these variants over a wide range of neural networks and tree ensembles. We believe that our results emphasize the intricate diversity of computing Shapley values, demonstrating how their complexity is substantially shaped by both the specific SHAP variant, the model type, and the distribution.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hostadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's G function is recursively defined via G(0) = 0 and then G(n) = n -G(G(n -1)). Following Hofstadter, a family (F\_k) of similar functions is obtained by varying the number k of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions F\_k . In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions F k are acting as right shifts of the digits. The Fibonacci-like sequences are then expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial X^k -X^(k-1) -1. Thanks to that, we estimate the discrepancy of each function F\_k , i.e., the maximal distance between F\_k and its linear equivalent. This discrepancy is finite exactly when k $\le$ 4. This also solves some related questions, in particular two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions F\_3 and F\_4 are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover F\_k can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when k $\le$ 2, while F\_k is almost additive exactly when k $\le$ 4. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of F\_3 .</description>

      <title>Resolving Nondeterminism with Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In automata theory, while determinisation provides a standard route to solving many common problems in automata theory, some weak forms of nondeterminism can be dealt with in some problems without costly determinisation. For example, the handling of specifications given by nondeterministic automata over infinite words for the problems of reactive synthesis or runtime verification requires resolving nondeterministic choices without knowing the future of the input word. We define and study classes of $\omega$-regular automata for which the nondeterminism can be resolved by a policy that uses a combination of memory and randomness on any input word, based solely on the prefix read so far.
  We examine two settings for providing the input word to an automaton. In the first setting, called adversarial resolvability, the input word is constructed letter-by-letter by an adversary, dependent on the resolver's previous decisions. In the second setting, called stochastic resolvability, the adversary pre-commits to an infinite word and reveals it letter-by-letter. In each setting, we require the existence of an almost-sure resolver, i.e., a policy that ensures that as long as the adversary provides a word in the language of the underlying nondeterministic automaton, the run constructed by the policy is accepting with probability 1.
  The class of automata that are adversarially resolvable is the well-studied class of history-deterministic automata. The case of stochastically resolvable automata, on the other hand, defines a novel class. Restricting the class of resolvers in both settings to stochastic policies without memory introduces two additional new classes of automata. We show that the new automaton classes offer interesting trade-offs between succinctness, expressivity, and computational complexity, providing a fine gradation between deterministic automata and nondeterministic automata.</description>

      <title>Completions of Kleene's second model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14656v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate completions of partial combinatory algebras (pcas), in particular of Kleene's second model $\mathcal{K}_2$ and generalizations thereof. We consider weak and strong notions of embeddability and completion that have been studied before in the literature. It is known that every countable pca can be weakly embedded into $\mathcal{K}_2$, and we generalize this to arbitrary cardinalities by considering generalizations of $\mathcal{K}_2$ for larger cardinals. This emphasizes the central role of $\mathcal{K}_2$ in the study of pcas. We also show that $\mathcal{K}_2$ and its generalizations have strong completions.</description>

      <title>Alternating Quantifiers in Uniform One-Dimensional Fragments with an Excursion into Three-Variable Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniform one-dimensional fragment of first-order logic was introduced a few years ago as a generalization of the two-variable fragment to contexts involving relations of arity greater than two. Quantifiers in this logic are used in blocks, each block consisting only of existential quantifiers or only of universal quantifiers. In this paper we consider the possibility of mixing both types of quantifiers in blocks. We show the finite (exponential) model property and NExpTime-completeness of the satisfiability problem for two restrictions of the resulting formalism: in the first we require that every block of quantifiers is either purely universal or ends with the existential quantifier, in the second we restrict the number of variables to three; in both equality is not allowed. We also extend the second variation to a rich subfragment of the three-variable fragment (without equality) that still has the finite model property and decidable, NExpTime-complete satisfiability.</description>
