      <title>Enhancing Car-Following Models with Bike Dynamics for Improved Traffic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road traffic simulations are crucial for establishing safe and efficient traffic environments. They are used to test various road applications before real-world implementation. SUMO is a well-known simulator for road networks and intermodal traffic, often used in conjunction with other tools to test various types of applications. Realistic simulations require accurate movement models for different road users, such as cars, bicycles, and buses. While realistic models are already implemented for most vehicle types, bicycles, which are essential for achieving safe and efficient traffic, can only be modeled as slow vehicles or fast pedestrians at present. This paper introduces the Realistic Bicycle Dynamics Model (RBDM), the first dedicated bicycle model for SUMO, addressing this significant gap. Leveraging real-world bicycle data from the SimRa dataset, the RBDM implements realistic speed, acceleration, and deceleration behaviors of bicycles in urban scenarios. The evaluation is conducted using the Monaco SUMO traffic scenario and a newly generated Berlin scenario in SUMO. The RBDM significantly outperforms the existing slow-vehicle approximation in SUMO, aligning more closely with real-world data. These results underscore the necessity of a realistic bicycle movement model for accurate simulations, given the significant differences in the movement profiles of bicycles, cars, and pedestrians. Furthermore, the model is tested for its ability to generalize to disparate scenarios and urban topologies, which is dependent on the manner and geographical region in which the SimRa data were gathered. In addition, recommendations are provided for how it could be adapted for use in different city topologies.</description>

      <title>The gradual transformation of inland countries -- human plowing, horse plowing and equity incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern countries have not learned their lessons and often hope for the wisdom of later generations, resulting in them only possessing modern technology and difficult to iterate ancient civilizations. At present, there is no way to tell how we should learn from history and promote the gradual upgrading of civilization. Therefore, we must tell the history of civilization's progress and the means of governance, learn from experience to improve the comprehensive strength and survival ability of civilization, and achieve an optimal solution for the tempering brought by conflicts and the reduction of internal conflicts. Firstly, we must follow the footsteps of history and explore the reasons for the long-term stability of each country in conflict, including providing economic benefits to the people and means of suppressing them; then, use mathematical methods to demonstrate how we can achieve the optimal solution at the current stage. After analysis, we can conclude that the civilization transformed from human plowing to horse plowing can easily suppress the resistance of the people and provide them with the ability to resist; The selection of rulers should consider multiple institutional aspects, such as exams, elections, and drawing lots; Economic development follows a lognormal distribution and can be adjusted by expected value and variance. Using a lognormal distribution with the maximum value to divide equity can adjust the wealth gap.</description>

      <title>How large language models judge and influence human cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to support decisions in social settings. Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral and political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based social decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected when the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a pressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect reciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others. Here, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide 21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate -- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these interactions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary game-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where the extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of LLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating cooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and between-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals. We show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact the prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms, showing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through goal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term social dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order to preserve human cooperation.</description>

      <title>What is the best shape of a city</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban form plays a crucial role in shaping transportation patterns, accessibility, energy consumption, and more. Our study examines the relationship between urban form and transportation energy use by developing a parametric model that simulates city structures and their impact on travel distances. We explore various urban morphologies, including sprawling, elongated, compact, and vertically concentrated cities, and consider five urban profiles: "needle," "pyramid," "pancake," "bowl," and "ring." We designed an interactive visualisation and calculator that enables the analysis of these effects, providing insights into the impact of various urban configurations. Our model quantifies the average commuting distances associated with these forms, demonstrating that compact and centrally dense cities minimise the total travel distance in cities.</description>

      <title>Gender and Discipline Shape Length, Content and Tone of Grant Peer Review Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer review by experts is central to the evaluation of grant proposals, but little is known about how gender and disciplinary differences shape the content and tone of grant peer review reports. We analyzed 39,280 review reports submitted to the Swiss National Science Foundation between 2016 and 2023, covering 11,385 proposals for project funding across 21 disciplines from the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), Life Sciences (LS), and Mathematics, Informatics, Natural Sciences, and Technology (MINT). Using supervised machine learning, we classified over 1.3 million sentences by evaluation criteria and sentiment. Reviews in SSH were significantly longer and more critical, with less focus on the applicant's track record, while those in MINT were more concise and positive, with a higher focus on the track record, as compared to those in LS. Compared to male reviewers, female reviewers write longer reviews that more closely align with the evaluation criteria and express more positive sentiments. Female applicants tend to receive reviews with slightly more positive sentiment than male applicants. Gender and disciplinary culture influence how grant proposals are reviewed - shaping the tone, length, and focus of peer review reports. These differences have important implications for fairness and consistency in research funding.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Heider Balance Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Heider balance theory models the evolution of social networks towards balanced states with stress minimization. Triad relationships are classically either balanced or imbalanced. However, real-world relationships often exhibit uncertainty, complexity, and interconnected dynamics that transcend this classical framework, and we will sometimes see the synchronicity of balance and imbalance states. When these triadics are simultaneously balanced and imbalanced, they form superposition and entanglement states that necessitate the introduction of quantum balance. This study introduces a framework that extends classical Heider balance theory from social network analysis by incorporating principles of quantum mechanics. In the framework, each triad is a quantum state of spin systems embedded in various network topologies. Using a quantum transformation operator, we investigate the emergence of balanced and imbalanced states and identify ground and steady states. In the quantum state, developments towards balance will occur by introducing the Hamiltonian within the creation and annihilation operators framework. In these developments, we witness the emergence of superposition and entanglement quantum states with no classical equivalent, which form an uncertainty in the states. When the quantum evolution is a functional temperature, we investigate the emergence of balanced and imbalanced states, analyze ground and steady states, and examine phase transitions as a function of temperature. Our results reveal novel dynamical behaviors unique to quantum social systems and offer a new perspective on collective decision-making, conflict resolution, and emergent order in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Historical Contingencies Steer the Topology of Randomly Assembled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are used to represent and analyze data in domains as diverse as physics, biology, chemistry, planetary science, and the social sciences. Across domains, random graph models relate generative processes to expected graph properties, and allow for sampling from distinct ensembles. Here we introduce a new random graph model, inspired by assembly theory, and characterize the graphs it generates. We show that graphs generated using our method represent a diverse ensemble, characterized by a broad range of summary statistics, unexpected even in graphs with identical degree sequences. Finally we demonstrate that the distinct properties of these graphs are enabled by historical contingencies during the generative process. These results lay the foundation for further development of novel sampling methods based on assembly theory with applications to drug discovery and materials science.</description>

      <title>Can Machines Philosophize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the Turing test, we present a novel methodological framework to assess the extent to which a population of machines mirrors the philosophical views of a population of humans. The framework consists of three steps: (i) instructing machines to impersonate each human in the population, reflecting their backgrounds and beliefs, (ii) administering a questionnaire covering various philosophical positions to both humans and machines, and (iii) statistically analyzing the resulting responses. We apply this methodology to the debate on scientific realism, a long-standing philosophical inquiry exploring the relationship between science and reality. By considering the outcome of a survey of over 500 human participants, including both physicists and philosophers of science, we generate their machine personas using an artificial intelligence engine based on a large-language generative model. We reveal that the philosophical views of a population of machines are, on average, similar to those endorsed by a population of humans, irrespective of whether they are physicists or philosophers of science. As compared to humans, however, machines exhibit a weaker inclination toward scientific realism and a stronger coherence in their philosophical positions. Given the observed similarities between the populations of humans and machines, this methodological framework may offer unprecedented opportunities for advancing research in experimental philosophy by replacing human participants with their machine-impersonated counterparts, possibly mitigating the efficiency and reproducibility issues that affect survey-based empirical studies.</description>

      <title>How do Probabilistic Graphical Models and Graph Neural Networks Look at Network Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11869v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</description>

      <title>From Interviews to Equations: A Multi-Phase System Dynamics Model of Engineering Student Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic approach for converting qualitative data into quantitative parameters within a system dynamics (SD) framework, focusing on modeling engineering student engagement. Although SD typically relies on numerical inputs, important "soft" factors such as motivation, confidence, and a sense of belonging have often been neglected due to the challenge of measurement. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with mechanical engineering students in a Learning Studio environment, capturing stories about hands-on coursework, peer support, and personal growth. Using inductive thematic analysis, frequent mentions of relevant factors were coded and converted into weighted parameters for a Vensim model. The resulting structure includes interconnected submodels illustrating how community cohesion influences motivation, which then affects learning outcomes and career goals. Simulation results show exponential growth in motivation, confidence, and sense of belonging over a sixteen-week period, alongside declines in negative factors like dissatisfaction. Introducing a logistic limit on belonging confirmed that, after social needs plateau, other positive aspects continue to improve. A scenario with a one-week delay in feedback loops reduced the rate of change but maintained the model's overall behavior. These findings align with educational theory, suggesting that community-driven interventions can enhance student engagement. This approach highlights the importance of capturing intangible, evolving student experiences in SD models. While additional validation with larger samples is necessary, the framework shows how incorporating qualitative insights into simulations can yield more actionable findings for educators and researchers.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Dynamics with Self-Interaction Learning in Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of cooperation in networked systems helps to understand the dynamics in social networks, multi-agent systems, and biological species. The self-persistence of individual strategies is common in real-world decision making. The self-replacement of strategies in evolutionary dynamics forms a selection amplifier, allows an agent to insist on its autologous strategy, and helps the networked system to avoid full defection. In this paper, we study the self-interaction learning in the networked evolutionary dynamics. We propose a self-interaction landscape to capture the strength of an agent's self-loop to reproduce the strategy based on local topology. We find that proper self-interaction can reduce the condition for cooperation and help cooperators to prevail in the system. For a system that favors the evolution of spite, the self-interaction can save cooperative agents from being harmed. Our results on random networks further suggest that an appropriate self-interaction landscape can significantly reduce the critical condition for advantageous mutants, especially for large-degree networks.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Altruistic Rationality Provides a Solution to Social Dilemmas via Rational Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decades of scientific inquiry have sought to understand how evolution fosters cooperation, a concept seemingly at odds with the belief that evolution should produce rational, self-interested individuals. Most previous work has focused on the evolution of cooperation among boundedly rational individuals whose decisions are governed by behavioral rules that do not need to be rational. Here, using an evolutionary model, we study how altruism can evolve in a community of rational agents and promote cooperation. We show that in both well-mixed and structured populations, a population of objectively rational agents is readily invaded by mutant individuals who make rational decisions but evolve a distorted (i.e., subjective) perception of their payoffs. This promotes behavioral diversity and gives rise to the evolution of rational, other-regarding agents who naturally solve all the known strategic problems of two-person, two-strategy games by perceiving their games as pure coordination games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sustainability has been defined as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. But what are the needs of the present? And are they met? From the poor performance of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), defined by the UN in 2015, not even the collective needs of the present seem to be met. How to expect not to compromise the needs of the future? Is the achievement of global world goals incompatible with the characteristic processes of human evolution, as some authors have recently suggested? Simple mathematical models cannot capture the whole breadth of human experience and destiny. But, on the other hand, one should not neglect whatever insights they may provide. And what these models teach us is how the behavior pattern "Parochial cooperation - Conflict - Growth" was reached and how this pattern, in addition to leading to several types of crises, is also on the way of the global governance needed to achieve the SDG's</description>

      <title>Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap -- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent architectural component.</description>
