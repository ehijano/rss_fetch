      <title>Optical Cycling and Sensitivity to the Electron's Electric Dipole Moment in Gold-Containing Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose diatomic molecules built from gold and carbon-group atoms as promising candidates for optical cycling and precision measurements. We show that this class of molecules (AuX, X = C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) features laser-accessible electronic transitions with nearly diagonal Franck-Condon factors. The $^2\Pi_{1/2}$ ground states can be easily polarized in the laboratory frame and have near-zero magnetic moments, valuable features for quantum science and precision measurement applications. The sensitivities of AuX molecules to the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) are found to be favorable, with effective electric fields of 10-30 GV/cm. Together, these features imply that AuX molecules may enable significantly improved searches for time-reversal symmetry violation.</description>

      <title>Robust High-frequency Laser Phase Noise Suppression by Adaptive Pound-Drever-Hall Feedforward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppressing high-frequency laser phase noise, particularly at frequencies near and beyond typical feedback bandwidths of a few MHz, is a critical yet challenging task in many advanced applications. Feedforward-based methods generally outperform feedback in high-frequency range, but their performances are more susceptible to perturbations. In this work, we focus on the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)-feedforward method we demonstrated recently [Yu-Xin Chao et al., Optica 11(7), 945-950 (2024)] and analyze the factors that affect its long-term stability. By constructing a simple circuit allowing for adaptive control of the feedforward gain in response to power fluctuations of cavity transmission, we demonstrate a robust $\geq 40$~dB suppression of laser phase noise around 2~MHz and a noise suppression bandwidth up to 50~MHz. In comparison, when using normal PDH feedback, robust noise suppression of over 40 dB can only occur for frequencies below tens of kHz in most setups. Our findings may pave the way for general usage of PDH feedforward and allow for simple construction of low-noise lasers for precise quantum controls and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and linear response modeling of high-fidelity Rydberg gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fidelity of entangling operations is a key figure of merit in quantum information processing, especially in the context of quantum error correction. High-fidelity entangling gates in neutral atoms have seen remarkable advancement recently. A full understanding of error sources and their respective contributions to gate infidelity will enable the prediction of fundamental limits on quantum gates in neutral atom platforms with realistic experimental constraints. In this work, we implement the time-optimal Rydberg CZ gate, design a circuit to benchmark its fidelity, and achieve a fidelity, averaged over symmetric input states, of 0.9971(5), setting a new state-of-the-art for neutral atoms. The remaining infidelity is explained by an ab initio error model, consistent with our experimental results over a range of gate speeds, with varying contributions from different error sources. Further, we develop a linear response formalism to efficiently predict infidelity from laser noise with non-trivial power spectral densities and derive scaling laws of infidelity with gate speed. Besides its capability of predicting gate fidelity, we also utilize the linear response formalism to compare and optimize gate protocols, to learn laser frequency noise, and to study the noise response for quantum simulation tasks. Finally, we predict that a CZ gate fidelity of ${\gtrsim} 0.999$ is feasible with realistic experimental upgrades.</description>

      <title>Long-lived collective Rydberg excitations in atomic gas achieved via ac-Stark lattice modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06513v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective Rydberg excitations provide promising applications ranging from quantum information processing, and quantum computing to ultra-sensitive electrometry. However, their short lifetime is an immense obstacle in real-life scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods of prolonging the lifetime were mainly implemented for ground-state quantum memories and would require a redesign to effectively work on different atomic transitions. We propose a protocol for extending the Rydberg excitation lifetime, which in principle can freeze the spin-wave and completely cancel the effects of thermal dephasing. The protocol employs off-resonant ac-Stark lattice modulation of spin waves by interfering two laser beams on the atomic medium. Our implementation showed that the excitation lifetime can be extended by an order of magnitude, paving the way towards more complex protocols for collective Rydberg excitations.</description>

      <title>Lorentz violating backgrounds from quadratic, shift-symmetric, ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an effective theory for a shift-symmetric, quadratically-coupled, ultralight spin-0 field. The leading CP-conserving interactions with Standard Model fields in the effective theory arise at dimension 8. We discuss the renormalization group evolution and positivity bounds on these operators, as well as their possible UV origins. Assuming that the spin-0 field is associated with an ultralight dark matter candidate, we discuss the effects of the dimension-8 operators on experiments searching for the oscillation of fundamental constants and Lorentz violation. We find that the direct bounds on these two effects are of similar strength but rather weak, corresponding to a UV cutoff scale of keV order, as they are mediated by dimension-8 operators.</description>
