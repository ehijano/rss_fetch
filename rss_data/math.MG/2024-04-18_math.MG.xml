      <title>Steiner trees with infinitely many terminals on the sides of an angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclidean Steiner problem is the problem of finding a set $St$, with the shortest length, such that $St \cup A$ is connected, where $A$ is a given set in a Euclidean space. The solutions $St$ to the Steiner problem will be called Steiner sets while the set $A$ will be called input. Since every Steiner set is acyclic we call it Steiner tree in the case when it is connected. We say that a Steiner tree is indecomposable if it does not contain any Steiner tree for a subset of the input.
  We are interested in finding the Steiner set when the input consists of infinitely many points distributed on two lines. In particular we would like to find a configuration which gives an indecomposable Steiner tree.
  We consider a self-similar input, namely the set $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ of points with coordinates $(\lambda^{k-1}\cos \alpha,$ $\pm \lambda^{k-1}\sin \alpha)$, where $\lambda&gt;0$ and $\alpha&gt;0$ are small fixed values. These points are distributed on the two sides of an angle of size $2\alpha$ in such a way that the distances from the points to the vertex of the angle are in a geometric progression.
  To our surprise, we show that in this case the solutions to the Steiner problem for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$, when $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are small enough, are always decomposable trees. More precisely, any Steiner tree for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ is a countable union of Steiner trees, each one connecting 5 points from the input. By considering only a finite number of components we obtain many solutions to the Steiner problem for finite sets composed of $4k+1$ points distributed on the two lines ($2k+1$ on a line and $2k$ on the other line). These solutions are very similar to the ladders of Chung and Graham.</description>

      <title>A Fourier analytic approach to exceptional set estimates for orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marstrand's celebrated projection theorem gives the Hausdorff dimension of the orthogonal projection of a Borel set in Euclidean space for almost all orthogonal projections. It is straightforward to see that sets for which the Fourier and Hausdorff dimension coincide have no exceptional projections, that is, \emph{all} orthogonal projections satisfy the conclusion of Marstrand's theorem. With this in mind, one might believe that the Fourier dimension (or at least, Fourier decay) could be used to give better estimates for the Hausdorff dimension of the exceptional set in general. We obtain projection theorems and exceptional set estimates based on the Fourier spectrum; a family of dimensions that interpolates between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions. We apply these results to show that the Fourier spectrum can be used to improve several results for the Hausdorff dimension in certain cases, such as Ren--Wang's sharp bound for the exceptional set in the plane, Peres--Schlag's exceptional set bound and Bourgain--Oberlin's sharp $0$-dimensional exceptional set estimate.</description>

      <title>Metric Sobolev spaces I: equivalence of definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of two works concerning the Sobolev calculus on metric measure spaces and its applications. In this work, we focus on several notions of metric Sobolev space and on their equivalence. More precisely, we give a systematic presentation of first-order $p$-Sobolev spaces, with $p\in[1,\infty)$, defined over a complete and separable metric space equipped with a boundedly-finite Borel measure. We focus on three different approaches: via approximation with Lipschitz functions; by studying the behaviour along curves, in terms either of the curve modulus or of test plans; via integration-by-parts, using Lipschitz derivations with divergence. Eventually, we show that all these approaches are fully equivalent. We emphasise that no doubling or Poincar\'{e} assumption is made, and that we allow also for the exponent $p=1$.
  A substantial part of this work consists of a self-contained and partially-revisited exposition of known results, which are scattered across the existing literature, but it contains also several new results, mostly concerning the equivalence of metric Sobolev spaces for $p=1$.</description>

      <title>Self-affinity of discs under glass-cut dissections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological disc is called $n$-self-affine if it has a dissection into $n$ affine images of itself. It is called $n$-gc-self-affine if the dissection is obtained by successive glass-cuts, which are cuts along segments splitting one disc into two. For every $n \ge 2$, we characterize all $n$-gc-self-affine discs. All such discs turn out to be either triangles or convex quadrangles. All triangles and trapezoids are $n$-gc-self-affine for every $n$. Non-trapezoidal quadrangles are not $n$-gc-self-affine for even $n$. They are $n$-gc-self-affine for every odd $n \ge 7$, and they are $n$-gc-self-affine for $n=5$ if they aren't affine kites. Only four one-parameter families of quadrangles turn out to be $3$-gc-self-affine.
  In addition, we show that every convex quadrangle is $n$-self-affine for all $n \ge 5$.</description>

      <title>On star-convex bodies with rotationally invariant sections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will prove that an origin-symmetric star-convex body $K$ with sufficiently smooth boundary and such that every hyperplane section of $K$ passing through the origin is a body of affine revolution, is itself a body of affine revolution. This will give a positive answer to the recent question asked by G. Bor, L. Hern\'andez-Lamoneda, V. Jim\'enez de Santiago, and L. Montejano-Peimbert, though with slightly different prerequisites.</description>

      <title>General Higher Order $L^p$ Mean Zonoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the higher-order difference body and the associated Rogers-Shephard inequality. Recently, Haddad, Langharst, Putterman, Roysdon and Ye expanded the concept to a burgeoning higher-order Brunn-Minkowski theory. In 1991, Zhang introduced mean zonoids of a convex body, which was extended to the Firey-Brunn-Minkowski theory setting by Xi, Guo and Leng in 2014. In this note, we extend these $L^p$ mean zonoids to the higher-order setting and establish the associated isoperimetric inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is based on Professor Vitali Kapovitch's comparison geometry course at the University of Toronto. It delves into various comparison theorems, including those by Rauch and Toponogov, focusing on their applications, such as Bishop-Gromov volume comparison, critical point theory of distance functions, diameter sphere theorem, and negative and nonnegative curvature. Additionally, it covers the soul theorem, splitting theorem, and covering theorem by Cheeger-Gromoll, as well as Perelman's proof of the soul conjecture. Finally, the note introduces Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, Alexandrov Spaces, and the Finite Homotopy type theorem by Grove-Peterson.</description>

      <title>The unbounded Lagrangian spectral norm and wrapped Floer cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the question of whether the spectral metric on the orbit space of a fiber in the disk cotangent bundle of a closed manifold, under the action of the compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group, is bounded. We utilize wrapped Floer cohomology to define the spectral invariant of an admissible Lagrangian submanifold within a Weinstein domain. We show that the pseudo-metric derived from this spectral invariant is a valid $Ham$-invariant metric. Furthermore, we establish that the spectral metric on the orbit space of an admissible Lagrangian is bounded if and only if the wrapped Floer cohomology vanishes. Consequently, we prove that the Lagrangian Hofer diameter of the orbit space for any fiber in the disk cotangent bundle of a closed manifold is infinite.</description>

      <title>Generalized Morse Theory for Tubular Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04034v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of Morse function and establish Morse theory-like theorems over offsets of a compact set in a Euclidean space at regular values of their distance function. Our approach involves non-smooth analysis over Lipschitz functions. This paper adds to previous works that were able to extend Morse theory to several classes of subsets of Euclidean spaces such as submanifolds, Whitney-stratified sets and sets with positive reach. We prove that in our setting, the homotopy type of the sublevels sets of suitably-defined Morse functions changes around a critical value by gluing exactly one cell around each critical point of the same value.</description>
