      <title>Sequence entropy of rank one systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sequence entropy of rank one measure-preserving systems along subexponential sequences. We prove that the sequence entropy along a large class of sequences can be infinite using Ornstein's probabilistic constructions. Moreover, we show that sequence entropy necessarily vanishes for subexponential sequences if the growth of tower heights remains below certain growth rates, and obtain a flexibility result for polynomial sequences at this critical threshold.</description>

      <title>Classification of horospherical invariant measures in higher rank: The Full Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify horospherical invariant Radon measures for Anosov subgroups of arbitrary semisimple real algebraic groups. This generalizes the works of Burger and Roblin in rank one to higher ranks. At the same time, this extends the works of Furstenberg, Veech, and Dani, and a special case of Ratner's theorem for finite-volume homogeneous spaces to infinite-volume Anosov homogeneous spaces.
  Especially, this resolves the open problems proposed by Landesberg--Lee--Lindenstrauss--Oh and by Oh. Our measure classification is in fact for a more general class of discrete subgroups, including relatively Anosov subgroups with respect to any parabolic subgroups, not necessarily minimal. Our method is rather geometric, not relying on continuous flows or ergodic theorems.</description>

      <title>Interacting dynamical systems on networks and fractals: discrete and continuous models, mean-field limit, and convergence rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuum limit and mean-field theory for interacting particle systems (IPS) on self-similar networks, a new class of discrete models whose large-scale behavior gives rise to nonlocal evolution equations on fractal domains. This work extends the graphon-based framework for IPS, used to derive continuum and mean-field limits in the non-exchangeable setting, to situations where the spatial domain is fractal rather than Euclidean. The motivation arises from both physical models naturally formulated on fractals and real-world networks exhibiting hierarchical or quasi-self-similar structure.
  Our analysis relies on tools from fractal geometry, including Iterated Function Systems and self-similar measures. A central result is an explicit isomorphism between self-similar IPS and graphon IPS, which allows us to justify the continuum and mean-field limits in the self-similar setting. This connection reveals that macroscopic dynamics on fractal domains emerge naturally as limits of dynamics on appropriate discretizations of fractal sets.
  Another contribution of the paper is the derivation of optimal convergence rates for the discrete self-similar models. We introduce a scale of generalized Lipschitz spaces on fractals, extending the Nikolskii-Besov spaces used in the Euclidean setting, and obtain convergence estimates for discontinuous Galerkin approximations of nonlocal equations posed on fractal domains. These results apply to kernels with minimal regularity addressing models relevant in applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent spatial organization of competing species under environmental stress and cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how species persist under interacting stressors is a central challenge in ecology. We develop a spatially explicit reaction-diffusion framework to investigate competing species in landscapes shaped by climate variability, pollution, resource heterogeneity, and cooperation. Here, temperature follows low-frequency oscillations, while pollution and resources diffuse from localized sources. Growth is governed by a dynamic carrying capacity integrating abiotic stress with an endogenous, pollution-sensitive cooperation field.
  Numerical simulations reveal the spontaneous emergence of persistent spatial organization, including dominance segregation and stable competitive boundaries. Quantitative analyses-using boundary geometry, fractal dimension, and spatial entropy-demonstrate a transition from intermixed initial states to low-complexity, quasi-stationary configurations. Coexistence occurs through distinct strategies: one species occupies more area, while the other maintains higher local densities. Cooperation enhances resilience but collapses in polluted zones, creating heterogeneous "social buffering."
  We further introduce a hybrid inverse modeling framework using a Swin Transformer to infer high-dimensional parameters from only two temporal snapshots. Trained on synthetic data, the model accurately recovers demographic, diffusive, and environmental-sensitivity parameters. While it achieves reliable short-term spatial predictions, long-term forecasts diverge due to the intrinsic sensitivity of nonlinear systems. This unified framework links sparse observations to mechanistic dynamics, advancing biodiversity forecasting under accelerating global change.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a family of finitely generated elementary amenable iet-groups. These groups are generated by finitely many rationals iets and rotations. For them, we state criteria for not virtual nilpotency or solvability, and we give conditions to ensure that they are not virtually solvable. We precise their abelianizations, we determine when they are isomorphic to certain lamplighter groups and we provide non isomorphic cases among them. As consequences, in the class of infinite finitely generated subgroups of iets up to isomorphism, we exhibit infinitely many non virtually solvable and non linear groups, and infinitely many solvable groups of arbitrary derived length.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of solitary waves in a lattice where all particles interact with each other by pair-wise repulsive forces that decay with distance. The variational existence proof is based on constrained optimization and provides a one-parameter family of unimodal solutions. We also describe the asymptotic behavior of large, fast, high-energy waves.</description>

      <title>A General Tikhonov Regularized Second-Order Dynamical System for Convex-Concave Bilinear Saddle Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general Tikhonov regularized second-order dynamical system with viscous damping, time scaling and extrapolation coefficients for the convex-concave bilinear saddle point problem. By the Lyapunov function approach, we show that the convergence properties of the proposed dynamical system depend on the choice of the Tikhonov regularization parameter. Specifically, when the Tikhonov regularization parameter tends to zero rapidly, the convergence rate of the primal-dual gap along the generated trajectory is O(1 over t squared times beta(t)); when the Tikhonov regularization parameter tends to zero slowly, the convergence rate of the primal-dual gap is o(1 over beta(t)). We also prove the strong convergence property of the trajectory generated by the Tikhonov regularized dynamical system to the minimum-norm solution of the convex-concave bilinear saddle point problem, and derive several integral estimates. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed dynamical system is verified through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) was recently proposed for state estimation in dynamical systems when only a sparse subset of the state variables can be observed. The S-DEIM estimate involves a kernel vector whose optimal value is inferred through a data assimilation algorithm. This data assimilation step suffers from two drawbacks: (i) It requires the knowledge of the governing equations of the dynamical system, and (ii) It is not generally guaranteed to converge to the optimal kernel vector. To address these issues, here we introduce an equation-free S-DEIM framework that estimates the optimal kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We show that the recurrent architecture is necessary since the kernel vector cannot be estimated from instantaneous observations. But RNNs, which incorporate the past history of the observations in the learning process, lead to nearly optimal estimations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on three numerical examples with increasing degree of spatiotemporal complexity: a conceptual model of atmospheric flow known as the Lorenz-96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Rayleigh-Benard convection. In each case, the resulting S-DEIM estimates are satisfactory even when a relatively simple RNN architecture, namely the reservoir computing network, is used. More specifically, our RNN-based S-DEIM state estimations reduce the relative error between 42% and 58% when compared to Q-DEIM which ignores the kernel vector by setting it equal to zero.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>Tameness of actions on finite rank median algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for (compact) finite-rank median algebras the geometric rank equals the independence number of all (continuous) median-preserving functions to $[0,1]$. Combined with Rosenthal's dichotomy, this yields a generalized Helly selection principle: for finite-rank median algebras, the space of all median-preserving functions to $[0,1]$ is sequentially compact in the pointwise topology. Generalizing joint results with E. Glasner on dendrons (rank-1), we establish that every continuous action of a topological group $G$ by median automorphisms on a finite-rank compact median algebra is Rosenthal representable, hence dynamically tame. As an application, the Roller-Fioravanti compactification of finite-rank topological median $G$-algebras with compact intervals is often a dynamically tame $G$-system.</description>

      <title>Singular basins in multiscale systems: tunneling between stable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world systems often evolve on different timescales and possess multiple coexisting stable states. Whether or not a system returns to a given stable state after being perturbed away from it depends on the shape and extent of its basin of attraction. We show that basins of attraction in multiscale systems can exhibit special geometric properties in the form of singular funnels. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different regions of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the system's resilience to perturbations. Consequently, singular funnels may prevent common dimensionality reductions in the limit of large timescale separation, such as the quasi-static approximation, adiabatic elimination and time-averaging of the fast variables. We refer to basins of attraction with singular funnels as singular basins. We show that singular basins are universal and occur robustly in a range of multiscale systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly adapting parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators.</description>

      <title>On the finite time blow-ups for solutions of nonlinear differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations where the dominant term, with respect to large spatial variables, causes blow-ups and is positively homogeneous of a degree $1+\alpha$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$. We prove that the asymptotic behavior of a solution $y(t)$ near a finite blow-up time $T_*$ is $(T_*-t)^{-1/\alpha}\xi_*$ for some nonzero vector $\xi_*$. Specific error estimates for $|(T_*-t)^{1/\alpha}y(t)-\xi_*|$ are provided. In some typical cases, they can be a positive power of $(T_*-t)$ or $1/|\ln(T_*-t)|$. This depends on whether the decaying rate of the lower order term, relative to the size of the dominant term, is of a power or logarithmic form. Similar results are obtained for a class of nonlinear differential inequalities with finite time blow-up solutions. Our results cover larger classes of nonlinear equations, differential inequalities and error estimates than those in the previous work.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>
