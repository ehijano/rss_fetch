      <title>A Survey on Recent Advances in Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organising maps are a powerful tool for cluster analysis in a wide range of data contexts. From the pioneer work of Kohonen, many variants and improvements have been proposed. This review focuses on the last decade, in order to provide an overview of the main evolution of the seminal SOM algorithm as well as of the methodological developments that have been achieved in order to better fit to various application contexts and users' requirements. We also highlight a specific and important application field that is related to commercial use of SOM, which involves specific data management.</description>

      <title>Automatic tuning of communication protocols for vehicular ad hoc networks using metaheuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) deals with a set of communicating vehicles which are able to spontaneously interconnect without any pre-existing infrastructure. In such kind of networks, it is crucial to make an optimal configuration of the communication protocols previously to the final network deployment. This way, a human designer can obtain an optimal QoS of the network beforehand. The problem we consider in this work lies in configuring the File Transfer protocol Configuration (FTC) with the aim of optimizing the transmission time, the number of lost packets, and the amount of data transferred in realistic VANET scenarios. We face the FTC with five representative state-of-the-art optimization techniques and compare their performance. These algorithms are: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Evolutionary Strategy (ES), and Simulated Annealing (SA). For our tests, two typical environment instances of VANETs for Urban and Highway scenarios have been defined. The experiments using ns- 2 (a well-known realistic VANET simulator) reveal that PSO outperforms all the compared algorithms for both studied VANET instances.</description>

      <title>A Bioplausible Model for the Expanding Hole Illusion: Insights into Retinal Processing and Illusory Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Expanding Hole Illusion is a compelling visual phenomenon in which a static, concentric pattern evokes a strong perception of continuous forward motion. Despite its simplicity, this illusion challenges our understanding of how the brain processes visual information, particularly motion derived from static cues. While the neural basis of this illusion has remained elusive, recent psychophysical studies [1] reveal that this illusion induces not only a perceptual effect but also physiological responses, such as pupil dilation. This paper presents a computational model based on Difference of Gaussians (DoG) filtering and a classical receptive field (CRF) implementation to simulate early retinal processing and to explain the underlying mechanisms of this illusion. Based on our results we hypothesize that the illusion arises from contrast-dependent lateral inhibition in early visual processing. Our results demonstrate that contrast gradients and multi-layered spatial processing contribute to the perception of expansion, aligning closely with psychophysical findings and supporting the role of retinal ganglion cells in generating this illusory motion signal. Our findings provide insights into the perceptual biases driving dynamic illusions and offer a new framework for studying complex visual phenomena.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Retina: An FPGA-based Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implementing accurate models of the retina is a challenging task, particularly in the context of creating visual prosthetics and devices. Notwithstanding the presence of diverse artificial renditions of the retina, the imperative task persists to pursue a more realistic model. In this work, we are emulating a neuromorphic retina model on an FPGA. The key feature of this model is its powerful adaptation to luminance and contrast, which allows it to accurately emulate the sensitivity of the biological retina to changes in light levels. Phasic and tonic cells are realizable in the retina in the simplest way possible. Our FPGA implementation of the proposed biologically inspired digital retina, incorporating a receptive field with a center-surround structure, is reconfigurable and can support 128*128 pixel images at a frame rate of 200fps. It consumes 1720 slices, approximately 3.7k Look-Up Tables (LUTs), and Flip-Flops (FFs) on the FPGA. This implementation provides a high-performance, low-power, and small-area solution and could be a significant step forward in the development of biologically plausible retinal prostheses with enhanced information processing capabilities</description>
