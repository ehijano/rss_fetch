      <title>Lattice stitching by eigenvector continuation for Holstein polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of lattice particle - phonon systems are fundamentally restricted by the exponential growth of the number of quantum states with the lattice size. Here, we demonstrate an algorithm that constructs the lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector for the Holstein model in extended lattices from eigenvalue problems for small, independent lattice segments. This leads to exponential reduction of the computational Hilbert space and allows applications of variational quantum algorithms to particle - phonon interactions in large lattices. We illustrate that the ground state of the Holstein polaron in the entire range of electron - phonon coupling, from weak to strong, and the lowest phonon frequency ($\omega/t = 0.1$) considered by numerical calculations to date can be obtained from a sequence of up to four-site problems. When combined with quantum algorithms, the present approach leads to a dramatic reduction of required quantum resources. We show that the ground state of the Holstein polaron in a lattice with 100 sites and 32 site phonons can be computed by a variational quantum eigensolver with 11 qubits.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate Mixed Quantum Classical Simulations of Vibrational Polaritonic Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in vibrational polaritonic chemistry, where ground-state chemical kinetics are modified via confined optical modes in a cavity, has surged in recent years. Although models have been developed to understand cavity-modified reactions, fully quantum mechanical simulations remain out of reach for the collective regime that involves many molecules, a critical aspect of the phenomenon. Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations offer a scalable alternative, but their accuracy requires testing and potential improvements even in the single-molecule limit. In this work, we take this step by first introducing the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) to address the limitations of traditional MQC methods. Second, we incorporate a quantum treatment of the cavity mode, moving beyond the classical approximations often employed in previous studies. Results for a single-molecule model of vibrational polaritonic chemistry show that combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode yields the most accurate rates. However, this scheme may produce different long-time population dynamics at zero coupling depending on whether the cavity mode is quantized; a problem known as size-inconsistency in MASH. We address this problem proposing the $\epsilon$-MASH approach, which forbids hopping between states with negligible nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). Combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode thus provides a promising approach for scalable and accurate MQC simulations in the collective regime.</description>

      <title>Continuous time crystals as a PT symmetric state and the emergence of critical exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous time-translation symmetry is often spontaneously broken in open quantum systems, and the condition for their emergence has been actively investigated. However, there are only a few cases in which its condition for appearance has been fully elucidated. In this Letter, we show that a Lindbladian parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry can generically produce persistent periodic oscillations in a wide class of systems. This includes one-collective spin models, which have been studied thoroughly in the context of dissipative continuous time crystals, and spatially extended bipartite bosonic systems with conserved particle number. Interestingly, the periodic orbits in the PT-symmetric phase are found to be center-type, implying an initial state dependence. These results are established by proving that the Lindbladian $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry at the microscopic level implies a nonlinear PT symmetry, and by performing a linear stability analysis near the transition point. This research will further our understanding of novel non-equilibrium phases of matter and phase transitions with spontaneous anti-unitary symmetry breaking.</description>
