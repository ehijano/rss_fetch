      <title>Kummer Surfaces, Isogenies and Theta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses geometric and computational aspects associated with $(n,n)$-isogenies for principally polarized Abelian surfaces and related Kummer surfaces. We start by reviewing the comprehensive Theta function framework for classifying genus-two curves, their principally polarized Jacobians, as well as for establishing explicit quartic normal forms for associated Kummer surfaces. This framework is then used for practical isogeny computations. A particular focus of the discussion is the $(n,n)$-Split isogeny case. We also explore possible extensions of Richelot's $(2,2)$-isogenies to higher order cases, with a view towards developing efficient isogeny computation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Singularities in Calogero--Moser Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we describe completely the singularities appearing in Calogero--Moser varieties associated (at any parameter) to the wreath product symplectic reflection groups. We do so by parameterizing the symplectic leaves in the variety, describing combinatorially the resulting closure relation and computing a transverse slice to each leaf. We also show that the normalization of the closure of each symplectic leaf is isomorphic to a Calogero--Moser variety for an associated (explicit) subquotient of the symplectic reflection group. This confirms a conjecture of Bonnaf\'e for these groups. We use the fact that the Calogero--Moser varieties associated to wreath products can be identified with certain Nakajima quiver varieties. In particular, our result identifying the normalization of the closure of each symplectic leaf with another quiver variety holds for arbitrary quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>On a decomposition theorem in equivariant generalized homology theories for finite group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A. Vistoli proved a decomposition theorem for the rational equivariant algebraic K-theory of a variety under the action of a finite group $G$. We generalize his result to more general algebraic (co)homology theories having the Mackey property and admitting localization long exact sequences. In general, the pieces are indexed by conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$. Our construction is based on some result about a decomposition of the rational Burnside ring of a finite group, which stands behind the classical splitting theorems for equivariant spectra in stable equivariant homotopy theory.
  Applying this result to the case of Borne's modular K-theory we exhibit a case where the splitting is indexed by not necessarily abelian subgroups.</description>

      <title>On the generalised Kummer fourfold of the Jacobian of a genus two curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a birational model of the generalised Kummer fourfold of the Jacobian of a genus two curve, based on a geometric interpretation of the addition law on this Jacobian, obtained by the properties of the linear system of conics on that curve. We show that our model has mild singularities and that it admits a finite ramified covering to the four-dimensional projective space.</description>

      <title>Coble duality for Jacobian Kummer fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study projective models of generalized Kummer fourfolds via O'Grady's theta groups and the classical Coble cubic. More precisely, we establish a duality between two singular models of the generalized Kummer fourfold of a Jacobian abelian surface. We also give projective models for singular Jacobian Kummer varieties of arbitrary dimension. Along the way, we also construct a first non-natural involution on the Hilbert square of a Jacobian surface. In the appendix, we study singularities of secants of arbitrary varieties at identifiable points, following Choi, Lacini, Park and Sheridan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ be a monoidal dg-category. We construct a complex controlling the deformation of the monoidal structure on $\mathcal{C}$ together with the deformation of the underlying dg-category itself. We show that in the case of a semisimple category $\mathcal{C}$ it reduces to the Davydov-Yetter complex. Furthermore, we study this complex in several special cases, in particular, in the case of the category of $A$-modules over a commutative algebra $A$ we obtain a complex computing operadic $E_2$-cohomology of $A$. And in the case of the category of representations of an associative bialgebra we recover the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex. In the latter case our construction can be considered as a generalization of the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex to quasi-bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Chern character operators and Okounkov's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Chern character operators on the equivariant cohomology of the Hilbert schemes of points in the complex affine plane $C^2$ with the action of the torus $(C^*)^2$, and partially verify Okounkov's Conjecture [Oko, Conjecture 2] in this setting. Our main idea is to apply the connection between the equivariant cohomology of these Hilbert schemes and the ring of symmetric functions, via the deformed vertex operators of Cheng and Wang [CW], (the integral form of) the Jack symmetric functions and the transformed Macdonald symmetric functions of Garsia and Haiman [GH, Hai].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a moduli space of ``complete quasimaps'' to $\mathsf{Bl}_{\mathbb{P}^s}(\mathbb{P}^r)$. The construction, following previous work for curves on projective spaces, essentially proceeds by blowing up Ciocan-Fontanine--Kim's space of quasimaps at loci where sections of line bundles are linearly dependent. We conjecture that tautological intersection numbers on these moduli spaces give enumerative counts of curves of fixed complex structure on $X$ subject to general incidence conditions, in contrast with traditional compactifications of the moduli spaces of maps. A result of Farkas guarantees that these spaces are pure of expected dimension. The conjecture is proven in dimension 2, where the main input is a Brill-Noether theorem for general curves on toric surfaces.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of Free Algebras of Modular Forms on Unitary Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical results on the classification of reflections in an arithmetic subgroup $\Gamma$ imply that if the graded algebra of modular forms $M_*(\Gamma)$ is freely generated, then $\Gamma$ must be an arithmetic subgroup of either the orthogonal group $\operatorname{O}^+(2,n)$ or the unitary group $\operatorname{U}(1,n)$. Vinberg and Schwarzman showed that in the orthogonal case, if $n&gt;10$, then it is never free. In this paper, we investigate the remaining unitary case and prove that, up to scaling, there are only finitely many isometry classes of Hermitian lattices of signature $(1, n)$ with $n &gt; 2$ over imaginary quadratic fields with odd discriminant that admit a free algebra of modular forms. In particular, when $n&gt;99$ (except over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, where we require $n &gt; 154$), the graded algebra $M_*(\Gamma)$ is never free for any arithmetic subgroup $\Gamma&lt;\operatorname{U}(1,n)$, thereby partially confirming a conjecture by Wang and Williams. As a byproduct, we also establish a finiteness result for reflective modular forms. In the course of this proof, we derive a formula for the covolume of an arithmetic subgroup of a special unitary group, presented as the stabiliser of a Hermitian lattice, which generalises Prasad's volume formula for principal arithmetic subgroups in the case of special unitary groups.</description>

      <title>The $abc$ conjecture is true almost always</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let ${\rm rad}(n)$ denote the product of distinct prime factors of an integer $n\geq 1$. The celebrated $abc$ conjecture asks whether every solution to the equation $a+b=c$ in triples of coprime integers $(a,b,c)$ must satisfy ${\rm rad}(abc) &gt; K_\varepsilon\, c^{1-\varepsilon}$, for some constant $K_\varepsilon&gt;0$. In this expository note, we present a classical estimate of de Bruijn that implies almost all such triples satisfy the $abc$ conjecture, in a precise quantitative sense. Namely, there are at most $O(N^{2/3})$ many triples of coprime integers in a cube $(a,b,c)\in\{1,\ldots,N\}^3$ satisfying $a+b=c$ and ${\rm rad}(abc) &lt; c^{1-\varepsilon}$. The proof is elementary and essentially self-contained. Beyond revisiting a classical argument for its own sake, this exposition is aimed to contextualize a new result of Browning, Lichtman, and Ter\"av\"ainen, who prove a refined estimate $O(N^{33/50})$, giving the first power-savings since 1962.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotics of the set $S(d)$ of possible prime orders of $K$-rational points on elliptic curves over number fields $K$ of degree $d$ as $d$ tends to infinity. Assuming some conjectures on the sparsity of newforms of weight $2$ and prime level with unexpectedly high analytic rank, we show that $\max S(d) \le 3d + 1$ for sufficiently large even $d$ and $\max S(d) = o(d)$ for odd $d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The projective space of symmetric tensors of degree d can be reinterpreted as a projective space of finite, graded Gorenstein rings with socle in degree d. Via a pair of explicit stability conditions (one for even values of d and one for odd values), the space of symmetric tensors is partitioned by Harder-Narasimhan filtration type. This is worked out explicitly for low degree examples in dimension three (the projective plane) and compared with the betti tables of the Gorenstein rings.</description>

      <title>Multiple q-zeta values and traces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(a)_\infty = (a; q)_\infty = \prod_{n=0}^\infty (1-aq^n)$. An elegant result of Bloch and Okounkov [BO] states that if $x = e^z$, then $$ \frac{(xq)_\infty (x^{-1}q)_\infty}{(q)_\infty^2}, $$ which appears in various traces in representation theory and algebraic geometry, is a formal power series in $z^2$ whose coefficient for $z^{2k}$ is a quasi-modular form of weight $2k$. Quasi-modular forms are special types of multiple $q$-zeta values. In this paper, we generalize this result of Bloch and Okounkov and prove that certain other traces are related to multiple $q$-zeta values. A simple case of our main results asserts that if $x = e^z$ and $y = e^w$, then $$ \frac{(xq)_\infty (yq)_\infty}{(q)_\infty (xyq)_\infty}, $$ which appears in [CW, Theorem 5] as a trace (the deformed Bloch-Okounkov $1$-point function), is a formal power series in $z$ and $w$ whose coefficient for $z^mw^n$ is a multiple $q$-zeta value (in the sense of [BK3, Oko]) of weight $(m+n)$.</description>

Abstract: We determine the N\'eron-Severi lattices of $K3$ hypersurfaces with large Picard number in toric three-folds derived from Fano polytopes. On each $K3$ surface, we introduce a particular elliptic fibration. In the proof of the main theorem, we show that the N\'eron-Severi lattice of each $K3$ surface is generated by a general fibre, sections and appropriately selected components of the singular fibres of our elliptic fibration. Our argument gives a certain proof of the Dolgachev conjecture for Fano polytopes, which is a conjecture on mirror symmetry for $K3$ surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the Morita invariance of Categorical Enumerative Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Categorical Enumerative Invariants (CEI) are invariants associated with a unital, cyclic, smooth $A_\infty$-category and a splitting of its non-commutative Hodge filtration. In this paper, we extend the definition of CEI to Calabi-Yau $A_\infty$-categories with a splitting. Moreover, we formulate and prove the Morita invariance of CEI. As part of our proof, we develop tools to construct unital and cyclic models for Calabi-Yau categories. In particular, we prove a unital version of Kontsevich-Soibelman's Darboux theorem. As an application, we compute CEI in some new examples. Also, when applied to derived categories of coherent sheaves, our results yield new invariants of smooth, proper Calabi-Yau 3-folds.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Beelen, Datta and Ghorpade for the number of points of varieties over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and positive integers $d,m,r$ with $1\leq r\leq \binom{m+d}{d}$. Let $S_d(m)$ be the $\mathbb{F}_q$ vector space of all homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ in $X_0,\dots,X_m$. Let $e_r(d,m)$ be the maximum number of $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points in the vanishing set of $W$ as $W$ varies through all subspaces of $S_d(m)$ of dimension $r$. Beelen, Datta and Ghorpade had conjectured an exact formula of $e_r(d,m)$ when $q\geq d+1$. We prove that their conjectured formula is true when $q$ is sufficiently large in terms of $m,d,r$. The problem of determining $e_r(d,m)$ is equivalent to the problem of computing the $r^{th}$ generalized hamming weights of projective the Reed Muller code $PRM_q(d,m)$. It is also equivalent to the problem of determining the maximum number of points on sections of Veronese varieties by linear subvarieties of codimension $r$.</description>

      <title>On the behavior of adjoint ideals under pure morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17537v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize adjoint ideal sheaves via ultraproducts and, utilizing this characterization, study their behavior under pure morphisms. In particular, given a pure morphism $f:Y \to X$ between normal quasi-projective complex varieties, a reduced divisor $D$ and an effective $\mathbb{Q}$-Weil divisor $\Gamma$ on $X$ without common components, we have the following result: if the cycle-theoretic pullback $E:=f^{\natural}D$ is reduced and $(Y, E+f^*\Gamma)$ is of plt type along $E$, then $(X, D+\Gamma)$ is of plt type along $D$. This provides an affirmative answer to a question posed by Z. Zhuang.</description>

      <title>Tautological projection for cycles on the moduli space of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15768v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a tautological projection operator for algebraic cycle classes on the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties $\mathcal{A}_g$: every cycle class decomposes canonically as a sum of a tautological and a non-tautological part. The main new result required for the definition of the projection operator is the vanishing of the top Chern class of the Hodge bundle over the boundary $\bar{\mathcal{A}}_g\smallsetminus \mathcal{A}_g$ of any toroidal compactification $\bar{\mathcal{A}}_g$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$. We prove the vanishing by a careful study of residues in the boundary geometry.
  The existence of the projection operator raises many natural questions about cycles on $\mathcal{A}_g$. We calculate the projections of all product cycles $\mathcal{A}_{g_1}\times \ldots \times \mathcal{A}_{g_\ell}$ in terms of Schur determinants, discuss Faber's earlier calculations related to the Torelli locus, and state several open questions. The Appendix contains a conjecture about the projection of the locus of abelian varieties with real multiplication.</description>

      <title>The Ziegler spectrum for enriched ringoids and schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ziegler spectrum for categories enriched in closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck categories is defined and studied in this paper. It recovers the classical Ziegler spectrum of a ring. As an application, the Ziegler spectrum as well as the category of generalised quasi-coherent sheaves of a reasonable scheme is introduced and studied. It is shown that there is a closed embedding of the injective spectrum of a coherent scheme endowed with the tensor fl-topology (respectively of a noetherian scheme endowed with the dual Zariski topology) into its Ziegler spectrum. It is also shown that quasi-coherent sheaves and generalised quasi-coherent sheaves are related to each other by a recollement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an unexpected general relation between the Jacobian syzygies of a projective hypersurface $V\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ with only isolated singularities and the nature of its singularities. This allows to establish a new method for the identification of quasi-homogeneous hypersurface isolated singularities. The result gives an insight on how the geometry is reflected in the Jacobian syzygies and extends previous results of the first, second and last author for free and nearly free plane curves [1].</description>

      <title>Equality of tropical rank and dimension for tropical linear series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tropical rank of a semimodule of rational functions on a metric graph mirrors the concept of rank in linear algebra. Defined in terms of the maximal number of tropically independent elements within the semimodule, this quantity has remained elusive due to the challenges of computing it in practice. In this note, we establish that the tropical rank is, in fact, precisely equal to the topological dimension of the semimodule, one more than the dimension of the associated linear system of divisors. Moreover, we show that the equality of divisorial and tropical ranks in the definition of tropical linear series is equivalent to the pure dimensionality of the corresponding linear system. We conclude with several complementary results and questions on combinatorial, topological, and computability properties of the tropical rank.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Identification of Stable Sheaf Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers generalizations of certain arithmetic complexes appearing in the work of Raicu and VandeBogert in connection with the study of stable sheaf cohomology on flag varieties. Defined over the ring of integer valued polynomials, we prove an isomorphism of these complexes as conjectured by Gao, Raicu, and VandeBogert. In particular, this shows that a previously made identification between the stable sheaf cohomology of hook and two column partition Schur functors applied to the cotangent sheaf of projective space can be made to be uniform with respect to these complexes. These results are extended to the projective space defined over the integers.</description>

      <title>On Abelian extensions in mixed characteristic and ramification in codimension one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Paul Roberts states that the integral closure of a regular local ring in a generically abelian extension is Cohen-Macaulay, provided the characteristic of the residue field does not divide the order of the Galois group. An example of Koh shows the conclusion is false in the modular case. After a modification to the statement concerning ramification over $p$ in codimension one, we give an extension of Roberts's theorem to the modular case for unramified regular local rings in mixed characteristic when the $p$-torsion of the Galois group is annihilated by $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several known constructions relate initial degenerations of projective toric varieties and Grassmannians to regular subdivisions of appropriate point configurations. We define a general framework which allows for partial generalizations of these constructions to arbitrary projective schemes (as well as their very affine parts). We associate a point configuration $A$ with any homogeneous ideal $I$. We obtain upper and lower bounds on every initial ideal of $I$, defining them in terms of the regular subdivision of $A$ given by the same weight. Furthermore, both bounds are interpreted categorically via (co)limits over the face poset of the subdivision. We also investigate when these bounds are exact, showing that the respective weights form a subfan in the secondary fan of $A$.</description>
