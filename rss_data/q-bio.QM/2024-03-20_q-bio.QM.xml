      <title>The Wreaths of KHAN: Uniform Graph Feature Selection with False Discovery Rate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphical models find numerous applications in biology, chemistry, sociology, neuroscience, etc. While substantial progress has been made in graph estimation, it remains largely unexplored how to select significant graph signals with uncertainty assessment, especially those graph features related to topological structures including cycles (i.e., wreaths), cliques, hubs, etc. These features play a vital role in protein substructure analysis, drug molecular design, and brain network connectivity analysis. To fill the gap, we propose a novel inferential framework for general high dimensional graphical models to select graph features with false discovery rate controlled. Our method is based on the maximum of $p$-values from single edges that comprise the topological feature of interest, thus is able to detect weak signals. Moreover, we introduce the $K$-dimensional persistent Homology Adaptive selectioN (KHAN) algorithm to select all the homological features within $K$ dimensions with the uniform control of the false discovery rate over continuous filtration levels. The KHAN method applies a novel discrete Gram-Schmidt algorithm to select statistically significant generators from the homology group. We apply the structural screening method to identify the important residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein during the binding process to the ACE2 receptors. We score the residues for all domains in the spike protein by the $p$-value weighted filtration level in the network persistent homology for the closed, partially open, and open states and identify the residues crucial for protein conformational changes and thus being potential targets for inhibition.</description>

      <title>Molecular Classification Using Hyperdimensional Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work introduces an innovative approach to graph learning by leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing. Graphs serve as a widely embraced method for conveying information, and their utilization in learning has gained significant attention. This is notable in the field of chemoinformatics, where learning from graph representations plays a pivotal role. An important application within this domain involves the identification of cancerous cells across diverse molecular structures.
  We propose an HDC-based model that demonstrates comparable Area Under the Curve results when compared to state-of-the-art models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or the Weisfieler-Lehman graph kernel (WL). Moreover, it outperforms previously proposed hyperdimensional computing graph learning methods. Furthermore, it achieves noteworthy speed enhancements, boasting a 40x acceleration in the training phase and a 15x improvement in inference time compared to GNN and WL models. This not only underscores the efficacy of the HDC-based method, but also highlights its potential for expedited and resource-efficient graph learning.</description>

      <title>Emergence of dynamical networks in termites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Termites form complex dynamical trail networks from simple individual rules when exploring their environment. To help identify those simple rules, we reconstructed trail networks from time-lapse images of roaming termites. We quantified the trails' frequentations over time and compared them to the ones obtained by a null model. Arena borders were preferred in both simulated and observed data. Yet, the amplification phenomenon was higher with real termites, underlining the role of pheromones.</description>

      <title>Settlement Mapping for Population Density Modelling in Disease Risk Spatial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In disease risk spatial analysis, many researchers especially in Indonesia are still modelling population density as the ratio of total population to administrative area extent. This model oversimplifies the problem, because it covers large uninhabited areas, while the model should focus on inhabited areas. This study uses settlement mapping against satellite imagery to focus the model and calculate settlement area extent. As far as our search goes, we did not find any specific studies comparing the use of settlement mapping with administrative area to model population density in computing its correlation to a disease case rate. This study investigates the comparison of both models using data on Tuberculosis (TB) case rate in Central and East Java Indonesia. Our study shows that using administrative area density the Spearman's $\rho$ was considered as "Fair" (0.566, p&lt;0.01) and using settlement density was "Moderately Strong" (0.673, p&lt;0.01). The difference is significant according to Hotelling's t test. By this result we are encouraging researchers to use settlement mapping to improve population density modelling in disease risk spatial analysis.
