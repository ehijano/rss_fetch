      <title>Two-sided bounds for dihedral angle sums of path and 4-ball tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tetrahedron is called a path tetrahedron, if it has three mutually orthogonal edges that do not intersect at a single point. A tetrahedron is called a 4-ball tetrahedron, if there exists a sphere tangent to all its edges. We derive two-sided tight bounds for dihedral angle sums of such tetrahedra. In particular, we prove that this sum lies in the interval (2{\pi}, 2.5{\pi}) for path tetrahedra and in [6 arccos 1/3, 3{\pi}) for 4-ball tetrahedra. Also some of their useful properties are presented.</description>

      <title>Side-to-side Tiling of the Sphere by Congruent Curvilinear Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The edge-to-edge tilings of the sphere by congruent polygons, where all edges are straight, have been completely classified. We classify the curvilinear version of the similar triangular tilings, where the edges may not be straight, and find that these are the modifications of the straight triangular tilings.</description>

      <title>On the Lambert conformal conical projection and the general map of the Russian Empire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of drawing geographical maps is the one of mapping a subset of the sphere, representing a country or some other region on the surface of the Earth, into the Euclidean plane, minimising certain distortion properties that are specified in advance. It is known that from the purely mathematical point of view, this is an extremely difficult problem. One of Leonhard Euler's duties during his first stay at the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Saint Petersburg (1727-1741) was to help establishing maps of the Russian Empire. He worked on this project under the direction of the famous French geographer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle, who was the head of the astronomy and geography departments of the Academy. The general map of the Russian Empire, together with several maps of its particular regions were published under Euler's direction in the so-called Russian Atlas in 1745. In his later memoir ``De proiectione geographica De Lisliana in mappa generali imperii russici usitata'', written in 1777, Euler developed the mathematical theory of the method used by Delisle on a heuristic basis, which he himself used for drawing the general map of the Russian Empire. This method usually carries now the name Delisle--Euler map. In a previous paper, the first two authors of the present paper compared the Delisle--Euler map with several other maps of the conical type, with respect to various mathematical distorsion properties. They showed that this map is the best one from all the points of view considered, when it is applied to the drawing of the Russian Empire. In the present paper, we compare the Euler--Delisle map with a map which was not considered in the paper mentioned, namely, the so-called Lambert conformal conical projection, applied to the same region of the Earth. We show that the latter is better in several respects than all the other maps considered in the previous paper, including the Delisle--Euler map.</description>

      <title>An interpolation of metrics and spaces of metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.13227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalization of Hausdorff's extension theorem of metrics, we prove an interpolation theorem of a family of metrics defined on closed subsets of metrizable spaces. As an application, we investigate typicality of subsets of moduli spaces of metrics. We observe that various sets of all metrics with properties appearing in metric geometry are dense intersections of countable open subsets in spaces of metrics on metrizable spaces. For instance, our study is applicable to the set of all non-doubling metrics and the set of all non-uniformly disconnected metrics.</description>

      <title>Rotation of a polytope in another one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the naive problem whether we can move a solid object in a solid box or not. We restrict move to rotation. In the case we can, the centre and the ``direction'' of rotation may be restricted. Simplifying, we consider possibility of rotation of a polytope within another one of the same dimension and give a criterion for the possibility. Consider the particular case of simplices of the same dimension assuming that the vertices of the inner simplex are contained in different facets of the outer one. Premising further that simplices are even dimensional, rotation is possible in a very general situation. However, in dimension 3, the possible case is not not general. Even in these elementary phenomena, the parity of the dimension seems to yield difference.</description>

      <title>Distributional sectional curvature bounds for Riemannian metrics of low regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sectional curvature bounds are of central importance in the study of Riemannian mani\-folds, both in smooth differential geometry and in the generalized synthetic setting of Alexandrov spaces. Riemannian metrics along with metric spaces of bounded sectional curvature enjoy a variety of, oftentimes rigid, geometric properties. The purpose of this article is to introduce and discuss a new notion of sectional curvature bounds for manifolds equipped with continuous Riemannian metrics of Geroch--Traschen regularity, i.e., $H^1_{\mathrm{loc}} \cap C^0$, based on a distributional version of the classical formula. Our main result states that for $g \in C^1$, this new notion recovers the corresponding bound based on triangle comparison in the sense of Alexandrov. A weaker version of this statement is also proven for locally Lipschitz continuous metrics.</description>

      <title>Timelike conjugate points in Lorentzian length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study notions of conjugate points along timelike geodesics in the synthetic setting of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces, inspired by earlier work for metric spaces by Shankar--Sormani. After preliminary considerations on convergence of timelike and causal geodesics, we introduce and compare one-sided, symmetric, unreachable and ultimate conjugate points along timelike geodesics. We show that all such notions are compatible with the usual one in the smooth (strongly causal) spacetime setting. As applications, we prove a timelike Rauch comparison theorem, as well as a result closely related to the recently established Lorentzian Cartan--Hadamard theorem by Er\"{o}s--Gieger. In the appendix, we give a detailed treatment of the Fr\'{e}chet distance on the space of non-stopping curves up to reparametrization, a technical tool used throughout the paper.</description>
