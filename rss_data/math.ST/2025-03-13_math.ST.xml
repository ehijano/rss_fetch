      <title>Distribution and Moments of a Normalized Dissimilarity Ratio for two Correlated Gamma Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$ following correlated Gamma distributions, characterized by identical scale and shape parameters and a linear correlation coefficient $\rho$. Our focus is on the parameter: \[
  D(X,Y) = \frac{|X - Y|}{X + Y}, \] which appears in applied contexts such as dynamic speckle imaging, where it is known as the \textit{Fujii index}. In this work, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability density function of $D(X,Y)$ as well as analytical formulas for its moments of order $k$. Our derivation starts by representing $X$ and $Y$ as two correlated exponential random variables, obtained from the squared magnitudes of circular complex Gaussian variables. By considering the sum of $k$ independent exponential variables, we then derive the joint density of $(X,Y)$ when $X$ and $Y$ are two correlated Gamma variables. Through appropriate varable transformations, we obtain the theoretical distribution of $D(X,Y)$ and evaluate its moments analytically. These theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations, with particular attention to two specific cases: zero correlation and unit shape parameter.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Graphon Estimation: Theory and Applications to Graphon Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of estimating a low-rank graphon from sampled network data, employing a singular value thresholding (SVT) estimator to create a piecewise-constant graphon based on the network's adjacency matrix. Under certain assumptions about the graphon's structural properties, we establish bounds on the operator norm distance between the true graphon and its estimator, as well as on the rank of the estimated graphon. In the second part of the paper, we apply our estimator to graphon games. We derive bounds on the suboptimality of interventions in the social welfare problem in graphon games when the intervention is based on the estimated graphon. These bounds are expressed in terms of the operator norm of the difference between the true and estimated graphons. We also emphasize the computational benefits of using the low-rank estimated graphon to solve these problems.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation for the stochastic Burgers equation driven by white noise from local measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For one dimensional stochastic Burgers equation driven by space-time white noise we consider the problem of estimation of the diffusivity parameter in front of the second-order spatial derivative. Based on local observations in space, we study the estimator derived in [Altmeyer, Rei{\ss}, Ann. Appl. Probab.(2021)] for linear stochastic heat equation that has also been used in [Altmeyer, Cialenco, Pasemann, Bernoulli (2023)] to cover large class of semilinear SPDEs and has been examined for the stochastic Burgers equation driven by trace class noise. We extend the achieved results by considering the space-time white noise case which has also relevant physical motivations. After we establish new regularity results for the solution, we are able to show that our proposed estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal.</description>

      <title>"All-Something-Nothing" Phase Transitions in Planted k-Factor Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of inferring a $k$-factor, specifically a spanning $k$-regular graph, planted within an Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(n,\lambda/n)$. We uncover an interesting "all-something-nothing" phase transition. Specifically, we show that as the average degree $\lambda$ surpasses the critical threshold of $1/k$, the inference problem undergoes a transition from almost exact recovery ("all" phase) to partial recovery ("something" phase). Moreover, as $\lambda$ tends to infinity, the accuracy of recovery diminishes to zero, leading to the onset of the "nothing" phase. This finding complements the recent result by Mossel, Niles-Weed, Sohn, Sun, and Zadik who established that for certain sufficiently dense graphs, the problem undergoes an "all-or-nothing" phase transition, jumping from near-perfect to near-zero recovery. In addition, we characterize the recovery accuracy of a linear-time iterative pruning algorithm and show that it achieves almost exact recovery when $\lambda &lt; 1/k$. A key component of our analysis is a two-step cycle construction: we first build trees through local neighborhood exploration and then connect them by sprinkling using reserved edges. Interestingly, for proving impossibility of almost exact recovery, we construct $\Theta(n)$ many small trees of size $\Theta(1)$, whereas for establishing the algorithmic lower bound, a single large tree of size $\Theta(\sqrt{n\log n})$ suffices.</description>

      <title>Addressing pitfalls in implicit unobserved confounding synthesis using explicit block hierarchical ancestral sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unbiased data synthesis is crucial for evaluating causal discovery algorithms in the presence of unobserved confounding, given the scarcity of real-world datasets. A common approach, implicit parameterization, encodes unobserved confounding by modifying the off-diagonal entries of the idiosyncratic covariance matrix while preserving positive definiteness. Within this approach, state-of-the-art protocols have two distinct issues that hinder unbiased sampling from the complete space of causal models: first, the use of diagonally dominant constructions, which restrict the spectrum of partial correlation matrices; and second, the restriction of possible graphical structures when sampling bidirected edges, unnecessarily ruling out valid causal models. To address these limitations, we propose an improved explicit modeling approach for unobserved confounding, leveraging block-hierarchical ancestral generation of ground truth causal graphs. Algorithms for converting the ground truth DAG into ancestral graph is provided so that the output of causal discovery algorithms could be compared with. We prove that our approach fully covers the space of causal models, including those generated by the implicit parameterization, thus enabling more robust evaluation of methods for causal discovery and inference.</description>

      <title>Competing-risk Weibull survival model with multiple causes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The failure of a system can result from the simultaneous effects of multiple causes, where assigning a specific cause may be inappropriate or unavailable. Examples include contributing causes of death in epidemiology and the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. We propose a parametric Weibull accelerated failure time model for multiple causes, incorporating a data-driven, individualized, and time-varying winning probability (relative importance) matrix. Using maximum likelihood estimation and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, our approach enables simultaneous estimation of regression coefficients and relative cause importance, ensuring consistency and asymptotic normality. A simulation study and an application to Alzheimer's disease demonstrate its effectiveness in addressing cause-mixture problems and identifying informative biomarker combinations, with comparisons to Weibull and Cox proportional hazards models.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimality of the Probability Flow ODE for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have become a foundational paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in generating samples from complex high-dimensional distributions. Despite the dominant adoption of probability flow ODE-based samplers in practice due to their superior sampling efficiency and precision, rigorous statistical guarantees for these methods have remained elusive in the literature. This work develops the first end-to-end theoretical framework for deterministic ODE-based samplers that establishes near-minimax optimal guarantees under mild assumptions on target data distributions. Specifically, focusing on subgaussian distributions with $\beta$-H\"older smooth densities for $\beta\leq 2$, we propose a smooth regularized score estimator that simultaneously controls both the $L^2$ score error and the associated mean Jacobian error. Leveraging this estimator within a refined convergence analysis of the ODE-based sampling process, we demonstrate that the resulting sampler achieves the minimax rate in total variation distance, modulo logarithmic factors. Notably, our theory comprehensively accounts for all sources of error in the sampling process and does not require strong structural conditions such as density lower bounds or Lipschitz/smooth scores on target distributions, thereby covering a broad range of practical data distributions.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein GANs are Minimax Optimal Distribution Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide non asymptotic rates of convergence of the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial networks (WGAN) estimator. We build neural networks classes representing the generators and discriminators which yield a GAN that achieves the minimax optimal rate for estimating a certain probability measure $\mu$ with support in $\mathbb{R}^p$. The probability $\mu$ is considered to be the push forward of the Lebesgue measure on the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ by a map $g^\star:\mathbb{T}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p$ of smoothness $\beta+1$. Measuring the error with the $\gamma$-H\"older Integral Probability Metric (IPM), we obtain up to logarithmic factors, the minimax optimal rate $O(n^{-\frac{\beta+\gamma}{2\beta +d}}\vee n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ where $n$ is the sample size, $\beta$ determines the smoothness of the target measure $\mu$, $\gamma$ is the smoothness of the IPM ($\gamma=1$ is the Wasserstein case) and $d\leq p$ is the intrinsic dimension of $\mu$. In the process, we derive a sharp interpolation inequality between H\"older IPMs. This novel result of theory of functions spaces generalizes classical interpolation inequalities to the case where the measures involved have densities on different manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Multi-target linear shrinkage is an extension of the standard single-target linear shrinkage for covariance estimation. We combine several constant matrices - the targets - with the sample covariance matrix. We derive the oracle and a \textit{bona fide} multi-target linear shrinkage estimator with exact and empirical mean. In both settings, we proved its convergence towards the oracle under Kolmogorov asymptotics. Finally, we show empirically that it outperforms other standard estimators in various situations.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Classical Spectrum Estimators with $L$-mixing Time-series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral estimation is a fundamental problem for time series analysis, which is widely applied in economics, speech analysis, seismology, and control systems. The asymptotic convergence theory for classical, non-parametric estimators, is well-understood, but the non-asymptotic theory is still rather limited. Our recent work gave the first non-asymptotic error bounds on the well-known Bartlett and Welch methods, but under restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds for a class of non-parametric spectral estimators, which includes the classical Bartlett and Welch methods, under the assumption that the data is an $L$-mixing stochastic process. A broad range of processes arising in time-series analysis, such as autoregressive processes and measurements of geometrically ergodic Markov chains, can be shown to be $L$-mixing. In particular, $L$-mixing processes can model a variety of nonlinear phenomena which do not satisfy the assumptions of our prior work. Our new error bounds for $L$-mixing processes match the error bounds in the restrictive settings from prior work up to logarithmic factors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we extend the classical Glivenko-Cantelli theorem to real-valued empirical functions under dependence structures characterised by $\alpha$-mixing and $\beta$-mixing conditions. We investigate sufficient conditions ensuring that families of real-valued functions exhibit the Glivenko-Cantelli (GC) property in these dependence settings. Our analysis focuses on function classes satisfying uniform entropy conditions, and we establish conditions on mixing coefficients to obtain GC theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic framework to study the dependence structure induced by deterministic discrete-time state-space systems between input and output processes is introduced. General sufficient conditions are formulated under which output processes exist and are unique once an input process has been fixed, a property that in the deterministic state-space literature is known as the echo state property. When those conditions are satisfied, the given state-space system becomes a generative model for probabilistic dependences between two sequence spaces. Moreover, those conditions guarantee that the output depends continuously on the input when using the Wasserstein metric. The output processes whose existence is proved are shown to be causal in a specific sense and to generalize those studied in purely deterministic situations. The results in this paper constitute a significant stochastic generalization of sufficient conditions for the deterministic echo state property to hold, in the sense that the stochastic echo state property can be satisfied under contractivity conditions that are strictly weaker than those in deterministic situations. This means that state-space systems can induce a purely probabilistic dependence structure between input and output sequence spaces even when there is no functional relation between those two spaces.</description>

      <title>A conversion theorem and minimax optimality for continuum contextual bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05714v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the contextual continuum bandits problem, where the learner sequentially receives a side information vector and has to choose an action in a convex set, minimizing a function associated with the context. The goal is to minimize all the underlying functions for the received contexts, leading to the contextual notion of regret, which is stronger than the standard static regret. Assuming that the objective functions are $\gamma$-H\"older with respect to the contexts, $0&lt;\gamma\le 1,$ we demonstrate that any algorithm achieving a sub-linear static regret can be extended to achieve a sub-linear contextual regret. We prove a static-to-contextual regret conversion theorem that provides an upper bound for the contextual regret of the output algorithm as a function of the static regret of the input algorithm. We further study the implications of this general result for three fundamental cases of dependency of the objective function on the action variable: (a) Lipschitz bandits, (b) convex bandits, (c) strongly convex and smooth bandits. For Lipschitz bandits and $\gamma=1,$ combining our results with the lower bound of Slivkins (2014), we prove that the minimax optimal contextual regret for the noise-free adversarial setting is achieved. Then, we prove that in the presence of noise, the contextual regret rate as a function of the number of queries is the same for convex bandits as it is for strongly convex and smooth bandits. Lastly, we present a minimax lower bound, implying two key facts. First, obtaining a sub-linear contextual regret may be impossible over functions that are not continuous with respect to the context. Second, for convex bandits and strongly convex and smooth bandits, the algorithms that we propose achieve, up to a logarithmic factor, the minimax optimal rate of contextual regret as a function of the number of queries.</description>

      <title>A generalized Bayesian approach for high-dimensional robust regression with serially correlated errors and predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a loss-based generalized Bayesian methodology for high-dimensional robust regression with serially correlated errors and predictors. The proposed framework employs a novel scaled pseudo-Huber (SPH) loss function, which smooths the well-known Huber loss, effectively balancing quadratic ($\ell_2$) and absolute linear ($\ell_1$) loss behaviors. This flexibility enables the framework to accommodate both thin-tailed and heavy-tailed data efficiently. The generalized Bayesian approach constructs a working likelihood based on the SPH loss, facilitating efficient and stable estimation while providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for all model parameters. Notably, this approach allows formal statistical inference without requiring ad hoc tuning parameter selection while adaptively addressing a wide range of tail behavior in the errors. By specifying appropriate prior distributions for the regression coefficients--such as ridge priors for small or moderate-dimensional settings and spike-and-slab priors for high-dimensional settings--the framework ensures principled inference. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for accurate parameter estimation and correct predictor selection under sparsity assumptions for a wide range of data generating setups. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to traditional Bayesian regression methods based on $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-loss functions. The results highlight its flexibility and robustness, particularly in challenging high-dimensional settings characterized by data contamination.</description>

Abstract: Our objective is to construct well-calibrated prediction sets for a time-to-event outcome subject to right-censoring with guaranteed coverage. Our approach is inspired by modern conformal inference literature in that, unlike classical frameworks, we obviate the need for a well-specified parametric or semiparametric survival model to accomplish our goal. In contrast to existing conformal prediction methods for survival data, which restrict censoring to be of Type I, whereby potential censoring times are assumed to be fully observed on all units in both training and validation samples, we consider the more common right-censoring setting in which either only the censoring time or only the event time of primary interest is directly observed, whichever comes first. Under a standard conditional independence assumption between the potential survival and censoring times given covariates, we propose and analyze two methods to construct valid and efficient lower predictive bounds for the survival time of a future observation. The proposed methods build upon modern semiparametric efficiency theory for censored data, in that the first approach incorporates inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting to account for censoring, while the second approach is based on augmenting this method with an additional correction term. For both methods, we formally establish asymptotic coverage guarantees and demonstrate, both theoretically and through empirical experiments, that the augmented approach substantially improves efficiency over the inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting method. Specifically, its coverage error bound is of second-order mixed bias type, that is doubly robust, and therefore guaranteed to be asymptotically negligible relative to the coverage error of the non-augmented method.</description>
