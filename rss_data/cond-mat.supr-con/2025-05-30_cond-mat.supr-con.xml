      <title>Spontaneous vortex lattice due to orbital magnetization in valley polarized superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the spontaneous formation of a vortex lattice in two-dimensional valley polarized superconductors due to orbital magnetization. The screening of magnetic field is weak for two-dimension superconductors, allowing for the magnetic flux associated with vortices to penetrate deep into the superconducting region. The Zeeman coupling between orbital magnetization and magnetic fields associated with vortices leads to the formation of a vortex lattice, once the vortex self-energy is lower than the Zeeman energy. We study the phase diagram and the vortex lattice configuration, and discuss the consequences of the vortex lattice formation in various experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Nanowire Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices: Critical Currents, Symmetries, and Vorticity Stability Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two weak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID), generalized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by parallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the current-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical for a homogeneous superconducting thin wire. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model predicts that the critical current ($I_c$) is a multi-valued function of the magnetic field. We also calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e., regions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution of vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the vortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the case of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many nanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions under which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100\% supercurrent modulation and quantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current curves obey $IB$ symmetry, while each VSR obeys $IBV$ symmetry. The model predicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which the critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the opposite polarity of the bias current. We also provide a classification of the stability regions produced by (1) completely symmetric, (2) phase disordered, (3) position disordered, (4) critical current disordered, and (5) completely disordered multi-wire SQUIDs.</description>

      <title>V. J. Emery and P. W. Anderson's views and related issues regarding the basics of cuprates: a re-look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1991, V. J. Emery in his important review article entitled "Some aspects of the theory of high temperature superconductors"\cite{emery1} argued against the Zhang-Rice reduction of three-band to an effective one-band model. In his words "...therefore it seems that the simple $t-J$ model does not account for the properties of high temperature superconductors". Over approximately 35 years after the initial debates\cite{debates} much has happened in the field pertaining to this topic. Even though it is one of the most discussed issue, a comprehensive account and the required resolution are lacking. Connected to the debate over one-band versus three-band models is another discussion: the one-component versus two-component model for cuprates. The two-component model is most strongly advocated by Barzykin and Pines\cite{bp}. In this article the author attempts a perspective and a re-look on some of these issues. After an analysis of a large body of literature, author finds that V. J. Emery's criticism of the Zhang-Rice reduction was correct. Many central experimental features of cuprates cannot be rationalized within the one-band model, and Johnston-Nakano scaling is one such example. Other examples are also discussed. Author introduces a simple-minded toy model to illustrate the core issues involved.</description>

      <title>Two-gap superconductor ZrB12 with dynamic stripes and charge density waves: Crystal structure, physical properties and pairing mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A review of long-term studies of ZrB12 and LuB12 superconductors with very similar conduction bands and phonon spectra, but with radically different (by a factor of 15-20) critical temperatures and magnetic fields is presented. A detailed analysis of well-known studies in combination with new results of structural, thermodynamic and charge transport measurements obtained here for these metallic dodecaborides with Jahn-Teller instability of the rigid boron network and with dynamic charge stripes allows us to conclude in favor of the primary role of nanoscale effects of electron phase separation, leading to the formation of one-dimensional dynamic chains with different configurations of fluctuating charges, which in the case of ZrB12 are predominantly 2p-states, and for LuB12- 5d-2p states. We propose a new plasmon-phonon pairing mechanism in ZrB12, which may be common to different classes of high-Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in a topological insulator nanowire proximitized by a superconductor" by Junya Feng et al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the interpretation of the experiment [Nature Physics 21, 708-715 (2025)] is misleading in two respects. First, the bias voltages impact the non-local differential conductance randomly, rather than systematically, and the bias symmetry of the non-local conductance in Fig. 3 can be explained by a fine tuned self-gating effect. Second, the full knowledge of the conductance matrix is insufficient to conclude on the relative values of the crossed-Andreev and elastic cotunneling probabilities, in particular on the dominance of one of them.</description>

      <title>Shot noise from which-path detection in a chiral Majorana interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the full counting statistics of charge transfer in a chiral Majorana interferometer - a setup where a Dirac mode (an electron-hole mode) is split into two Majorana modes that encircle a number of h/2e vortices in a topological superconductor. Without any coupling to the environment it is known that the low-energy charge transfer is deterministic: An electron is transferred either as an electron or as a hole, dependent on the parity of the vortex number. We show that a stochastic contribution appears if which-path information leaks into the environment, producing the shot noise of random 2e charge transfers with binomial statistics. The Fano factor (dimensionless ratio of shot noise power and conductance) increases without bound as the which-path detection probability tends to unity.</description>

      <title>A Straightforward Gradient-Based Approach for High-Tc Superconductor Design: Leveraging Domain Knowledge via Adaptive Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials design aims to discover novel compounds with desired properties. However, prevailing strategies face critical trade-offs. Conventional element-substitution approaches readily and adaptively incorporate various domain knowledge but remain confined to a narrow search space. In contrast, deep generative models efficiently explore vast compositional landscapes, yet they struggle to flexibly integrate domain knowledge. To address these trade-offs, we propose a gradient-based material design framework that combines these strengths, offering both efficiency and adaptability. In our method, chemical compositions are optimised to achieve target properties by using property prediction models and their gradients. In order to seamlessly enforce diverse constraints, including those reflecting domain insights such as oxidation states, discretised compositional ratios, types of elements, and their abundance, we apply masks and employ a special loss function, namely the integer loss. Furthermore, we initialise the optimisation using promising candidates from existing dataset, effectively guiding the search away from unfavourable regions and thus helping to avoid poor solutions. Our approach demonstrates a more efficient exploration of superconductor candidates, uncovering candidate materials with higher critical temperature than conventional element-substitution and generative models. Importantly, it could propose new compositions beyond those found in existing databases, including new hydride superconductors absent from the training dataset but which share compositional similarities with materials found in literature. This synergy of domain knowledge and machine-learning-based scalability provides a robust foundation for rapid, adaptive, and comprehensive materials design for superconductors and beyond.</description>

      <title>Thermal Annealing and Radiation Effects on Structural and Electrical Properties of NbN/GaN Superconductor/Semiconductor Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, niobium nitride (NbN) superconductors have emerged as integral components due to their unique structural properties, including a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), exceptional electrical conductivity, and compatibility with advanced device architectures. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature annealing and high-dose gamma irradiation on the structural and superconducting properties of NbN films grown on GaN via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited cubic {\delta}-NbN (111) films exhibited a high-intensity XRD peak, high Tc of 12.82K, and an atomically flat surface. Annealing at 500 and 950 {\deg}C for varying durations revealed notable structural and surface changes. High-resolution STEM indicated improved local ordering, while AFM showed reduced surface roughness after annealing. XPS revealed a gradual increase in the Nb/N ratio with higher annealing temperatures and durations. High-resolution XRD and STEM analyses showed lattice constant modifications in {\delta}-NbN films, attributed to residual stress changes following annealing. Additionally, XRD phi-scans revealed sixfold symmetry in NbN films due to rotational domains relative to GaN. While Tc remained stable after annealing at 500 {\deg}C, increasing the annealing temperature to 950 {\deg}C degraded Tc to ~8K and reduced the residual resistivity ratio from 0.85 in as-deposited films to 0.29 after 30 minutes. The effects of gamma radiation (5 Mrad (Si)) were also studied, demonstrating minimal changes to crystallinity and superconducting performance, indicating excellent radiation resilience. These findings highlight the potential of NbN superconductors for integration into advanced quantum devices and their suitability for applications in radiation-intensive environments such as space, satellites, and nuclear power plants.</description>

      <title>Metal-to-superconductor Transition Induced by Lithium Adsorption on Monolayer 1$T$-Nb$_2$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, two-dimensional Nb$_2$C has garnered increasing attention due to its functional-group-dependent superconductivity, both experimentally and theoretically. In contrast to the halogen and chalcogen additives that have been the main focus of previous studies, we study the effect of lithium adsorption, which can also be incorporated during the synthesis of Nb$_2$C. Our computational analysis reveals a metal-to-superconductor transition in monolayer Nb$_2$C with a critical temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) of 22.1 K and a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution following the adsorption of lithium atoms. This emergent superconductivity is attributed to the increased electronic states at the Fermi energy, resulting from the contribution of Nb-$d$ orbitals and electron gas states induced by the low electronegativity of lithium. Furthermore, the application of tensile strain raises the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ to 24 K, which is higher than that of most functional-group-modified Nb$_2$C systems. Our work deepens the understanding of electron-phonon coupling in layered Nb$_2$C, and provides new insights into achieving high critical temperature superconductivity with a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution in this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00741v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions mediated by electron-phonon coupling are responsible for important cooperative phenomena in metals such as superconductivity and charge-density waves. The same interaction mechanisms produce strong collision rates in the normal phase of correlated metals, causing sizeable reductions of the dc conductivity and reflectivity. As a consequence, low-energy excitations like phonons, which are crucial for materials characterization, become visible in optical infrared spectra. A quantitative assessment of vibrational resonances requires the evaluation of dynamical Born effective charges, which quantify the coupling between macroscopic electric fields and lattice deformations. We show that the Born effective charges of metals crucially depend on the collision regime of conducting electrons. In particular, we describe, within a first principles framework, the impact of electron scattering on the infrared vibrational resonances, from the undamped, collisionless regime to the overdamped, collision-dominated limit. Our approach enables the interpretation of vibrational reflectance measurements of both super and bad conducting metals, as we illustrate for the case of strongly electron-phonon coupled superhydride H$_3$S.</description>

      <title>Two-particle self-consistent approach for broken symmetry phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking of interacting fermion systems constitutes a major challenge for many-body theory due to the proliferation of new independent scattering channels once absent or degenerate in the symmetric phase. One example is given by the ferro/antiferromagnetic broken symmetry phase (BSP) of the Hubbard model, where vertices in the spin-transverse and spin-longitudinal channels become independent with a consequent increase in the computational power for their calculation. We generalise the non-perturbative Two-Particle- Self-Consistent method (TPSC) to address broken SU(2) magnetic phases in the Hubbard model, offering an efficient approach that incorporates strong correlations. We show that in the BSP, the sum-rule enforcement of susceptibilities must be accompanied by a modified gap equation resulting in a renormalisation of the order parameter, vertex corrections and the preservation of the gap-less feature of the Goldstone modes. We then apply the theory to the antiferromagnetic phase of the Hubbard model in the cubic lattice at half-filling. We compare our results of double occupancies and staggered magnetisation to the ones obtained using Diagrammatic Monte Carlo showing excellent quantitative agreement. We demonstrate how vertex corrections play a central role in lowering the Higgs resonance with respect to the quasi-particle excitation gap in the spin-longitudinal susceptibility, yielding a well visible Higgs-mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from a double quantum dot realization of a minimal Kitaev chain, we demonstrate that non-Hermicity stabilizes the so-called poor man's Majorana zero modes in a region of parameter space that is much broader than in the Hermitian regime. In particular, we consider the simplest non-Hermitian mechanism which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs and is commonly present in all transport experiments. Specifically, such couplings induce exceptional points which connect stable and highly tunable zero energy real lines that are well separated from the quasicontinuum. Such zero-energy lines reflect spectral degeneracies protected by topology and represent the non-Hermitian generalization of the Hermitian poor mans Majorana modes occurring at single points in parameter space. Our findings pave the way for realizing robust non-Hermitian effects by combining unconventional superconductors and non-Hermitian topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the discommensuration between the Fermi surfaces of a conduction sea and an underlying spin liquid provides a natural mechanism for the spontaneous formation of pair density waves. Using a recent formulation of the Kondo lattice model which incorporates a Yao Lee spin liquid proposed by the authors, we demonstrate that doping away from half-filling induces finite-momentum electron-Majorana pair condensation, resulting in amplitude-modulated PDWs. Our approach provides a precise, analytically tractable pathway for understanding the spontaneous formation of PDWs in higher dimensions and offers a natural mechanism for PDW formation in the absence of a Zeeman field.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements have established self-intercalation as a powerful technique for manipulating quantum material properties, with precisely controllable intercalation concentrations. Given the inherently rich phase diagrams of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), studying the self-intercalated TMDCs can offer promising candidates for investigating the interplay between various orderings. This work focuses on fully intercalated bilayer TaSe$_2$ (Ta$_3$Se$_4$), which has recently been fabricated experimentally. By performing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the suppression of an intrinsic $3\times3$ charge density wave (CDW) in parent TaSe$_2$ layers, and the emergence of $2\times 2$, $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$, or the absence of a CDW in the intercalated layers, depending on the interlayer stacking orders and intercalation sites being occupied. Particularly, the $2\times 2$ CDW shows an increase in electronic states at the Fermi level compared to its non-CDW phase. This unusual behavior contrasts with that of typical CDW materials in TMDCs. Furthermore, superconductivity is preserved in these Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures, with superconducting transition temperatures comparable to or substantially smaller than those of TaSe$_2$. Spin-orbit coupling is found to enhance the density of states at Fermi levels while simultaneously reducing the electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. These two competing effects result in varying impacts on superconductivity across different Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures. Moreover, our calculations indicate that magnetic order is absent. Our study deepens the understanding of underlying physics in Ta$_3$Se$_4$, and provides experimentally feasible candidates for studying CDW, superconductivity, and their interplay.</description>
