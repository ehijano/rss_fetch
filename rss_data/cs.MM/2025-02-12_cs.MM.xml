      <title>Visual-based spatial audio generation system for multi-speaker environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multimedia applications such as films and video games, spatial audio techniques are widely employed to enhance user experiences by simulating 3D sound: transforming mono audio into binaural formats. However, this process is often complex and labor-intensive for sound designers, requiring precise synchronization of audio with the spatial positions of visual components. To address these challenges, we propose a visual-based spatial audio generation system - an automated system that integrates face detection YOLOv8 for object detection, monocular depth estimation, and spatial audio techniques. Notably, the system operates without requiring additional binaural dataset training. The proposed system is evaluated against existing Spatial Audio generation system using objective metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves spatial consistency between audio and video, enhances speech quality, and performs robustly in multi-speaker scenarios. By streamlining the audio-visual alignment process, the proposed system enables sound engineers to achieve high-quality results efficiently, making it a valuable tool for professionals in multimedia production.</description>

      <title>A New Hybrid Intelligent Approach for Multimodal Detection of Suspected Disinformation on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the rapid dissemination of multimedia content, identifying disinformation on social media platforms such as TikTok represents a significant challenge. This study introduces a hybrid framework that combines the computational power of deep learning with the interpretability of fuzzy logic to detect suspected disinformation in TikTok videos. The methodology is comprised of two core components: a multimodal feature analyser that extracts and evaluates data from text, audio, and video; and a multimodal disinformation detector based on fuzzy logic. These systems operate in conjunction to evaluate the suspicion of spreading disinformation, drawing on human behavioural cues such as body language, speech patterns, and text coherence. Two experiments were conducted: one focusing on context-specific disinformation and the other on the scalability of the model across broader topics. For each video evaluated, high-quality, comprehensive, well-structured reports are generated, providing a detailed view of the disinformation behaviours.</description>

      <title>Cardiverse: Harnessing LLMs for Novel Card Game Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prototyping of computer games, particularly card games, requires extensive human effort in creative ideation and gameplay evaluation. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate and streamline these processes. However, it remains challenging for LLMs to design novel game mechanics beyond existing databases, generate consistent gameplay environments, and develop scalable gameplay AI for large-scale evaluations. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive automated card game prototyping framework. The approach highlights a graph-based indexing method for generating novel game designs, an LLM-driven system for consistent game code generation validated by gameplay records, and a gameplay AI constructing method that uses an ensemble of LLM-generated action-value functions optimized through self-play. These contributions aim to accelerate card game prototyping, reduce human labor, and lower barriers to entry for game developers.</description>

      <title>HDCompression: Hybrid-Diffusion Image Compression for Ultra-Low Bitrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image compression under ultra-low bitrates remains challenging for both conventional learned image compression (LIC) and generative vector-quantized (VQ) modeling. Conventional LIC suffers from severe artifacts due to heavy quantization, while generative VQ modeling gives poor fidelity due to the mismatch between learned generative priors and specific inputs. In this work, we propose Hybrid-Diffusion Image Compression (HDCompression), a dual-stream framework that utilizes both generative VQ-modeling and diffusion models, as well as conventional LIC, to achieve both high fidelity and high perceptual quality. Different from previous hybrid methods that directly use pre-trained LIC models to generate low-quality fidelity-preserving information from heavily quantized latent, we use diffusion models to extract high-quality complimentary fidelity information from the ground-truth input, which can enhance the system performance in several aspects: improving indices map prediction, enhancing the fidelity-preserving output of the LIC stream, and refining conditioned image reconstruction with VQ-latent correction. In addition, our diffusion model is based on a dense representative vector (DRV), which is lightweight with very simple sampling schedulers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HDCompression outperforms the previous conventional LIC, generative VQ-modeling, and hybrid frameworks in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualization, providing balanced robust compression performance at ultra-low bitrates.</description>

      <title>Music for All: Exploring Multicultural Representations in Music Generation Models (Camera Ready)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Music-Language Models has greatly enhanced the automatic music generation capability of AI systems, but they are also limited in their coverage of the musical genres and cultures of the world. We present a study of the datasets and research papers for music generation and quantify the bias and under-representation of genres. We find that only 5.7% of the total hours of existing music datasets come from non-Western genres, which naturally leads to disparate performance of the models across genres. We then investigate the efficacy of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques in mitigating this bias. Our experiments with two popular models -- MusicGen and Mustango, for two underrepresented non-Western music traditions -- Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music, highlight the promises as well as the non-triviality of cross-genre adaptation of music through small datasets, implying the need for more equitable baseline music-language models that are designed for cross-cultural transfer learning.</description>

      <title>EgoTextVQA: Towards Egocentric Scene-Text Aware Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce EgoTextVQA, a novel and rigorously constructed benchmark for egocentric QA assistance involving scene text. EgoTextVQA contains 1.5K ego-view videos and 7K scene-text aware questions that reflect real-user needs in outdoor driving and indoor house-keeping activities. The questions are designed to elicit identification and reasoning on scene text in an egocentric and dynamic environment. With EgoTextVQA, we comprehensively evaluate 10 prominent multimodal large language models. Currently, all models struggle, and the best results (Gemini 1.5 Pro) are around 33% accuracy, highlighting the severe deficiency of these techniques in egocentric QA assistance. Our further investigations suggest that precise temporal grounding and multi-frame reasoning, along with high resolution and auxiliary scene-text inputs, are key for better performance. With thorough analyses and heuristic suggestions, we hope EgoTextVQA can serve as a solid testbed for research in egocentric scene-text QA assistance.</description>

      <title>VidCRAFT3: Camera, Object, and Lighting Control for Image-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent image-to-video generation methods have demonstrated success in enabling control over one or two visual elements, such as camera trajectory or object motion. However, these methods are unable to offer control over multiple visual elements due to limitations in data and network efficacy. In this paper, we introduce VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation that enables control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction simultaneously. To better decouple control over each visual element, we propose the Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer, which integrates lighting direction, text, and image in a symmetric way. Since most real-world video datasets lack lighting annotations, we construct a high-quality synthetic video dataset, the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset. This dataset includes lighting direction annotations and objects of diverse appearance, enabling VidCRAFT3 to effectively handle strong light transmission and reflection effects. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training strategy that eliminates the need for training data annotated with multiple visual elements (camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VidCRAFT3 in producing high-quality video content, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of control granularity and visual coherence. All code and data will be publicly available. Project page: https://sixiaozheng.github.io/VidCRAFT3/.</description>

      <title>Efficient Distributed Training through Gradient Compression with Sparsification and Quantization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of gradient compression on distributed training performance, focusing on sparsification and quantization techniques, including top-k, DGC, and QSGD. In baseline experiments, random-k compression results in severe performance degradation, highlighting its inefficacy. In contrast, using top-k and DGC at 50 times compression yields performance improvements, reducing perplexity by up to 0.06 compared to baseline. Experiments across 1, 2, and 4 workers demonstrate that conservative sparsification can have a regularizing effect, especially for smaller models, while compression ratios above 5000 times impair performance, particularly for DGC. Communication times are reduced across all compression methods, with top-k and DGC decreasing communication to negligible levels at high compression ratios. However, increased computation times offset this efficiency for top-k due to sorting demands, making it less scalable than DGC or QSGD. In convergence tests, sparsification techniques show accelerated convergence, requiring fewer epochs than the baseline, which has implications for computational savings. Although precision trade-offs emerge, floating point errors are mitigated by compression. This study's findings underscore the need to tune hyperparameters specifically for each compression technique to achieve optimal model performance, especially in distributed training systems.</description>

      <title>RenderBox: Expressive Performance Rendering with Text Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expressive music performance rendering involves interpreting symbolic scores with variations in timing, dynamics, articulation, and instrument-specific techniques, resulting in performances that capture musical can emotional intent. We introduce RenderBox, a unified framework for text-and-score controlled audio performance generation across multiple instruments, applying coarse-level controls through natural language descriptions and granular-level controls using music scores. Based on a diffusion transformer architecture and cross-attention joint conditioning, we propose a curriculum-based paradigm that trains from plain synthesis to expressive performance, gradually incorporating controllable factors such as speed, mistakes, and style diversity.
  RenderBox achieves high performance compared to baseline models across key metrics such as FAD and CLAP, and also tempo and pitch accuracy under different prompting tasks. Subjective evaluation further demonstrates that RenderBox is able to generate controllable expressive performances that sound natural and musically engaging, aligning well with prompts and intent.</description>

      <title>Fast Audio Codec Identification Using Overlapping LCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio data are widely exchanged over telecommunications networks. Due to the limitations of network resources, these data are typically compressed before transmission. Various methods are available for compressing audio data. To access such audio information, it is first necessary to identify the codec used for compression. One of the most effective approaches for audio codec identification involves analyzing the content of received packets. In these methods, statistical features extracted from the packets are utilized to determine the codec employed. This paper proposes a novel method for audio codec classification based on features derived from the overlapped longest common sub-string and sub-sequence (LCS). The simulation results, which achieved an accuracy of 97% for 8 KB packets, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over conventional approaches. This method divides each 8 KB packet into fifteen 1 KB packets with a 50% overlap. The results indicate that this division has no significant impact on the simulation outcomes, while significantly speeding up the feature extraction, being eight times faster than the traditional method for extracting LCS features.</description>

      <title>BioVL-QR: Egocentric Biochemical Vision-and-Language Dataset Using Micro QR Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces BioVL-QR, a biochemical vision-and-language dataset comprising 23 egocentric experiment videos, corresponding protocols, and vision-and-language alignments. A major challenge in understanding biochemical videos is detecting equipment, reagents, and containers because of the cluttered environment and indistinguishable objects. Previous studies assumed manual object annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. To address the issue, we focus on Micro QR Codes. However, detecting objects using only Micro QR Codes is still difficult due to blur and occlusion caused by object manipulation. To overcome this, we propose an object labeling method combining a Micro QR Code detector with an off-the-shelf hand object detector. As an application of the method and BioVL-QR, we tackled the task of localizing the procedural steps in an instructional video. The experimental results show that using Micro QR Codes and our method improves biochemical video understanding. Data and code are available through https://nishi10mo.github.io/BioVL-QR/</description>
