      <title>Observation of quantum effects on radiation reaction in strong fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation reaction describes the effective force experienced by an accelerated charge due to radiation emission. Quantum effects dominate charge dynamics and radiation production[1][2] for charges accelerated by fields with strengths approaching the Schwinger field, $\mathbf{E_{sch}=}$\textbf{\SI[detect-weight]{1.3e18}{\volt\per\metre}[3]. Such fields exist in extreme astrophysical environments such as pulsar magnetospheres[4], may be accessed by high-power laser systems[5-7], dense particle beams interacting with plasma[8], crystals[9], and at the interaction point of next generation particle colliders[10]. Classical radiation reaction theories do not limit the frequency of radiation emitted by accelerating charges and omit stochastic effects inherent in photon emission[11], thus demanding a quantum treatment. Two quantum radiation reaction models, the quantum-continuous[12] and quantum-stochastic[13] models, correct the former issue, while only the quantum-stochastic model incorporates stochasticity[12]. Such models are of fundamental importance, providing insight into the effect of the electron self-force on its dynamics in electromagnetic fields. The difficulty of accessing conditions where quantum effects dominate inhibited previous efforts to observe quantum radiation reaction in charged particle dynamics with high significance. We report the first direct, high significance $(&gt;5{\sigma})$ observation of strong-field radiation reaction on charged particles. Furthermore, we obtain strong evidence favouring the quantum radiation reaction models, which perform equivalently, over the classical model. Robust model comparison was facilitated by a novel Bayesian framework which inferred collision parameters. This framework has widespread utility for experiments where parameters governing lepton-laser collisions cannot be directly measured, including those using conventional accelerators.</description>

      <title>One-point correlators of conserved and non-conserved charges in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-point correlators of conserved charges are argued to be perturbatively IR safe in QCD, which includes not only the density of energy, but also those of electric charge, isospin and baryon number. Theoretical and phenomenological aspects of the density matrix of one-point correlators are discussed in the context of the states produced by a chiral current, as in the decay of a polarized electroweak boson. Densities of some non-conserved charges such as energy with arbitrary non-negative powers, despite their incalculability, are shown to obey an infinite set of consistency constraints. QCD is observed to live near a kink in the allowed parameter space of one-point correlators.</description>

      <title>Crossing the desert: Towards predictions for SMEFT coefficients from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SMEFT provides a general framework to search for new physics beyond the current reach of direct detection. One such form of new physics is quantum gravity. Based on dimensional analysis, one would expect the prediction that the quantum-gravity contribution to the SMEFT coefficients is unmeasurably tiny at LHC scales. In this paper, we test this expectation in a specific framework for quantum gravity, namely the asymptotic safety framework. In this framework, Wilson coefficients can be calculated in relatively straightforward manner, making a connection between quantum gravity and LHC tests of the SMEFT achievable. We work in a toy model of the Standard Model fermion sector to investigate four-fermion couplings. We find three scenarios in this toy model, based on three distinct fixed points of the Renormalization Group flow. In the first scenario, the expectation from dimensional analysis is borne out and Wilson coefficients are Planck-scale suppressed. In the second and third scenarios, the Wilson coefficients are significantly larger than expected by dimensional analysis, due to interacting fixed points which generate an effective new-physics scale that lies between the LHC scale and the Planck scale. We comment on the implications of these results for the testability of asymptotically safe gravity within the SMEFT framework at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Freezing-in Cannibal Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Interacting Dark Matter models can successfully explain dark matter (DM) production through interactions confined within the dark sector. However, they often lack measurable experimental signals due to their secluded nature. Including a feeble interaction with the visible sector through a Higgs portal leads not only to potential detection avenues and richer thermal production dynamics, but also to a possible explanation of the initial dark sector population through the freeze-in mechanism. In this work we study, by solving the full system of coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities and temperatures of all the involved states, three scenarios of this type where the DM is: a real scalar with broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$, a complex scalar with unbroken $\mathbb{Z}_3$, and a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ scalar with an additional scalar mediator. All of these models have viable dark matter candidates in a cannibal phase while having different detection profiles. We show that cosmological bounds can be either exacerbated or evaded by changing the dark sector interactions, leading to potential signatures in long-lived particle and indirect detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Massive two-loop four-point Feynman integrals at high energies with AsyInt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytic techniques for parametric integrations of massive two-loop four-point Feynman integrals at high energies, and their implementation in the toolbox AsyInt. In the high-energy region, the Feynman integrals involving external and internal massive particles, such as the top quark, Higgs and vector bosons, can be asymptotically expanded and directly calculated in the small-mass limit. With this approach, analytic results for higher orders in the expansion parameter and the dimensional regulator can be obtained with AsyInt. These results are important ingredients for the two-loop electroweak and QCD corrections for $2 \to 2$ scattering processes in the large transverse momenta region, which is relevant to both precision collider phenomenology and new physics searches at the LHC. In this paper, analytic results of representative planar and non-planar Feynman integrals are presented.</description>

      <title>Search for dark matter in the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity at the International Linear Collider (ILC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the possibility of Dark Matter (DM) fermions production alongside a gauge boson (A$^{\prime}$) using a model based on Einstein-Cartan gravity in an electron-positron linear collider, such as the ILC, that operates at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV with a detector's integrated luminosity of 1000 fb$^{-1}$. We used the WHIZARD package as the event generator to simulate the $ e^{+} e^{-}$ interactions that lead to the production of di-muon pairs and missing transverse energy. We specifically are performing this study on a low mass dark gauge boson, M$_{A^\prime}$= 10 GeV, that can subsequently decay into a muon pair (A$^\prime\rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-})$ while aiming to set upper limits on the free parameters' masses of the model, such as the torsion field (ST), if evidence for physics beyond the standard model is not found.</description>

      <title>Exploring Top-Quark Signatures of Heavy Flavor-Violating Scalars at the LHC with Parametrized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study flavor-violating scalars (flavons) in a range of large masses that have not been explored previously. We model the interactions with an effective field theory formulation where the flavon is heavier than the top quark. In addition, we assume that the flavon only couples to fermions of the Standard Model in a flavor-changing way. As the flavon couples strongly to top quarks, same-sign and opposite-sign top quark pair signals can be explored in the search for those particles. Using parametrized neural networks, we show that it is possible to probe flavons with masses in the 200-1600 GeV range through their interactions with a top quark plus up and charm quarks for effective couplings of order 10^-2 TeV^-1 at the 14 TeV High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>A Markov Chain Monte Carlo determination of Proton PDF uncertainties at NNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current scientific standard in PDF uncertainty estimation relies either on repeated fits over artificially generated data to arrive at Monte Carlo samples of best fits or on the Hessian method, which uses a quadratic expansion of the figure of merit, the $\chi^2$-function. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods allows one to access the uncertainties of PDFs without making use of quadratic approximations in a statistically sound procedure while at the same time preserving the correspondence between the sample and $\chi^2$-value. Rooted in Bayesian statistics the $\chi^2$-function is repeatedly sampled to obtain a set of PDFs that serves as a representation of the statistical distribution of the PDFs in their function space. After removing the dependence between the samples (the so-called autocorrelation) the set can be used to propagate the uncertainties to physical observables. The final result is an independent procedure to obtain PDF uncertainties that can be confronted by the state-of-the-art in order to ultimately arrive at a better understanding of the proton's structure.</description>

      <title>Quark Mass Effects in Higgs Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effect of finite top- and bottom-quark masses on the Higgs production cross section in the gluon-gluon fusion channel. We employ both $\overline{\text{MS}}$ and on-shell renormalisation for the quark masses and provide a thorough comparison. Furthermore, we explore alternative treatments of quark masses, in particular in the four-flavour scheme, and investigate their impact on the cross section. Our work also presents novel predictions for differential cross sections in the Higgs rapidity. The results lead to a significant reduction of scale uncertainties, and our analysis enables us to offer well-grounded recommendations for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Two-field inflation from one complex scalar with symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-field inflation derived from a single complex scalar with a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Inflation is characterized by two parameters, the vacuum expectation value and the mass parameter of the phase mode, which give rise to a variety of inflationary structures. We categorize the potential trajectories of the two inflaton fields and determine the parameter regions consistent with current observational data. Furthermore, we examine the reheating process through the inflaton decay to right-handed neutrinos and the subsequent lepton number generation within these parameter regions. Our finding suggests that the existence of multiple fields can significantly alter the possibilities for inflaton oscillations and reheating.</description>

      <title>Thermal pion condensation: holography meets lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model is often employed to describe strongly-coupled baryonic and isospin-asymmetric matter, for example in the context of neutron stars. Here we consider the case of vanishing baryon chemical potential, where detailed comparisons to data from lattice QCD are possible. To this end, we extend previous works by including a realistic pion mass and pion condensation into the decompactified limit of the model and evaluate the system for arbitrary isospin chemical potentials and temperatures. After suitably fixing the 3 parameters of the model, we find that the overall phase structure is in excellent agreement with lattice results. This also holds for observables at low temperatures in the strongly coupled regime, while we discover and discuss some discrepancies at large temperatures. Our findings give reassurance for the validity of previous and future applications of this model and highlight the aspects where improvements are needed.</description>

      <title>New Laboratory Constraints on Neutrinophilic Mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinophilic mediators are well-motivated messenger particles that can probe some of the least known sectors of fundamental physics involving nonstandard interactions of neutrinos with themselves and potentially with dark matter. In particular, light mediators coupling to the active neutrinos will induce new decay modes of the Standard Model mesons (e.g., $\pi^\pm, K^\pm \to \ell^\pm + \nu + \phi$), charged leptons (e.g., $\tau^\pm \to \pi^\pm + \nu + \phi$), and gauge bosons (e.g., $Z \to \nu + \bar{\nu} + \phi$). A common lore is that these decays suffer from infrared divergences in the limit of the vanishing mediator mass, i.e., $m_\phi \to 0$. Here, we show for the first time that including the 1-loop contributions of these mediators to the standard 2-body decays (e.g., $\pi^\pm,\,K^\pm \to \ell^\pm + \nu$, etc.), the infrared divergence from the 3-body decay cancels out exactly by virtue of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem. Including these cancellation effects, we then update the existing laboratory constraints on neutrinophilic scalar mediators, thereby extending the limits far beyond the decaying parent particle mass and excluding a wider range of parameter space. These new "physical" limits derived here have significant implications for the future detection prospects of nonstandard neutrino (self-)interactions.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of fermions at local equilibrium: Second-order gradient expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the spin polarization of spin-1/2 fermions in a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the second order in the gradient expansion, including second-order derivatives. The second-order derivative terms vanish if the local equilibrium hypersurface is the hyperplane $t=const$ in the collision center-of-mass frame. However, since the freeze-out hypersurface has a non-trivial space-time structure, these terms may result in a non-vanishing contribution to the spin polarization, whose magnitude needs to be assessed with numerical computations.</description>

      <title>On a possible $^{3}_{\phi}$H hypernucleus with HAL QCD interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Faddeev formalism in configuration space, we investigate bound states in the $\phi NN$ system with total isospin $T=0$ and $T=1$. The recently proposed lattice HAL QCD $\phi N$ potential in the $^{4}S_{3/2}$ channel does not support either $\phi N$ or $\phi NN$ bound states. The HAL QCD $\phi N$ potential in the $^{2}S_{1/2}$ channel suggests the bound states for $\phi N$ and $\phi NN (S=0)$ systems. However, the binding energies are highly sensitive to variations of the enhancement factor $\beta$, and the $\phi NN$ system is extremely strongly bound in the state $S=0$. Considering a spin-averaged potential %$(\frac{1}{3}V_{\phi N}^{1/2}+\frac{2}{3}V_{\phi N}^{3/2})$ for the state $S=1$ yields a bound state for $^3_\phi$H $(S=1)$ hypernucleus with the binding energy (BE) 14.9 MeV when $\beta = 6.9$. The evaluation of the BE for the $S=1$, $T=1$ three-body state results in 5.47 MeV. %Also, We evaluated the BE for the $S=1$, $T=1$ three-body state as 5.47 MeV. Additionally, calculations using our approach confirm the bound states for the $\phi NN$ ($S=2,T=0$ and $S=1, T=1$) system previously predicted with the Yukawa-type potential motivated by the QCD van der Waals attractive force, mediated by multi-gluon exchanges.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Bootstrap of Massive Inflation Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation correlators with massive exchanges are central observables of cosmological collider physics, and are also important theoretical data for us to better understand quantum field theories in dS. However, they are difficult to compute directly due to many technical complications of the Schwinger-Keldysh integral. In this work, we initiate a new bootstrap program for massive inflation correlators with dispersion relations on complex momentum planes. We classify kinematic variables of a correlator into vertex energies and line energies, and develop two distinct types of dispersion relations for both of them, respectively called vertex dispersion and line dispersion relations. These dispersion methods allow us to obtain full analytical results of massive correlators from a knowledge of their oscillatory signals alone, while the oscillatory signal at the tree level can be related to simpler subgraphs via the cutting rule. We further apply this method to massive loop correlators, and obtain new analytical expressions for loop diagrams much simpler than existing results from spectral decomposition. In particular, we show that the analyticity demands the existence of an "irreducible background" in the loop correlator, which is unambiguously defined, free of UV divergence, and independent of renormalization schemes.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of 2SC quark matter in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bulk viscosity of moderately hot and dense, neutrino-transparent color superconducting quark matter arising from weak-interaction-driven direct Urca processes. The quark matter is modeled using Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model improved to account for vector and t'Hooft interactions as well as antisymmetric pairing among the red/green up and down quarks. The unpaired excitations are the strange quarks and the blue up or down quarks. We compute the relaxation rates associated with $d$ and $s$-quark decay and electron capture processes on $u$ quark for blue color. The resulting bulk viscosity for density oscillations in the 1 to 10\,kHz range shows a resonant peak at $T\sim 5\,\MeV$, and the damping time may drop below 10 ms. This is short enough to affect the post-merger evolution and is very similar to the damping predicted in nuclear matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the set of classical polylogarithmic functions $\text{Li}_n$ with branching locus determined by the solution of $p_1\cdot p_2\cdot \ldots \cdot p_n=0$, where $p_1,\ldots, p_n$ are irreducible polynomials of several variables. We present an algorithm of constructing a complete set of possible arguments of $\text{Li}_n$ functions. The corresponding Mathematica code is included as ancillary file. Using this algorithm and the symbol map, we provide some examples of polylogarithmic identities.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Halo profiles: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations, we computed neutrino profiles within virialized dark matter haloes. These new high-resolution simulations allowed us to revisit fitting formulas proposed in the literature and provided updated fitting parameters that extend to less massive haloes and lower neutrino masses than previously in the literature, in accordance with new cosmological limits. The trend we observe for low neutrino masses is that, for dark matter halo masses below $\sim 4\times10^{14}$$h^{-1}M_\odot$, the presence of the core becomes weaker and the profile over the whole radius is closer to a simple power law. We also characterized the neutrino density profile dependence on the solid angle within clustered structures: a forward-backward asymmetry larger than 10% was found when comparing the density profiles from neutrinos along the direction of motion of cold dark matter particles within the same halo. In addition, we looked for neutrino wakes around halo centres produced by the peculiar motion of the halo itself. Our results suggest that the wakes effect is observable in haloes with masses greater than $3\times10^{14}$ $h^{-1}M_\odot$ where a mean displacement of $0.06$\hmpc was found.</description>

Abstract: We calculate quantum corrections to the symmetry generators for the transversity operators in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the two-loop approximation. Using this result, we obtain the evolution kernel for the corresponding operators at three loops.

      <title>Lessons from LHC on the LFV Higgs decays $h \to \ell_a \ell_b$ in the Two-Higgs Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-conservation of the lepton number has been explored at the LHC through the Lepton-Flavor Violating (LFV) Higgs decays $h\to\ell_a\ell_b$, with $\ell_{a,\,b}=e,\,\mu,\,\tau$ $(a \neq b)$. Current limits on these decays are a source of valuable information on the structure of the Yukawa and Higgs sectors. The LFV Higgs couplings can arise within the general Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM); the predicted rates for these decay modes depend on the specific Yukawa structure being considered, ranging from a vanishing branching ratio at tree-level for some versions (2HDM-I, II, X, Y), up to large and detectable ratios within the general 2HDM-III. An attractive scenario is given by the texturized version of the model (2HDM-Tx), with the Yukawa matrices having some texture zeros, such as the minimal version with the so-called Cheng-Sher ansazt. We study the constraints on the parameter space of the 2HDM provided by experimental and theoretical restrictions, and use them to study the detection of LFV Higgs modes at LHC. We find several encouraging scenarios to the search for the decay $h \to\tau\mu$ that could be achieved in the High-Luminosity LHC. On the other hand, LFV Higgs couplings can also be induced at one-loop level in the 2HDM with neutrino masses, with the loops being mediated by neutrino interactions; we find that the resulting branching ratios are of order $10^{-7}$ at best, which is out of the reach of current and future phases of the LHC.</description>

      <title>SMEFT analysis of charged lepton flavor violating $B$-meson decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) processes, potentially important for various Beyond the Standard Model Physics scenarios are analyzed in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. We consider the most relevant 2 quark-2 lepton $(2q2\ell)$ operators for the leptonic and semi-leptonic LFV B-decay (LFVBD) processes $B_s\to \mu^+e^- , B^+\to K^+\mu^+e^-, B^0\to K^{*0}\mu^+ e^-, {\rm and}~ B_s\to \phi\mu^-e^+$. We analyse the interplay among the Wilson coefficients responsible for these LFVBDs and other cLFV processes like $\rm CR (\mu\to e)$, $\ell_i \to \ell_j \gamma$, $\ell_i \to\ell_j\ell_k\ell_m$ and $Z \to \ell_i \ell_j$, to find the maximal possible LFV effects in $B$-meson decays. We probe the scale of new physics in relation to the constraints imposed by both classes of the LFV decays while considering both the present bounds and future expectations. In view of proposed experiments at LHCb-II and Belle II to study charged LFV processes, we have also provided the upper limits on the indirect constraints on such LFVBDs. For the processes where $B$ meson is decaying to $\mu^{\pm}$ and $e^{\mp}$, we show that new physics can be constrained by an enhancement of 2-4 orders of magnitude on the current sensitivities of the BRs of $B^+\to K^+\mu^+e^-, B^0\to K^{*0}\mu^+ e^- {\rm and}~ B_s\to\phi\mu^{\pm}e^{\mp}$.</description>

      <title>An atomic probe of dark matter differential interactions with elementary particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching for physics beyond the Standard Model is one of the main tasks of experimental physics. Candidates for dark matter include axion-like ultralight bosonic particles. Comagnetometers form ultra-high sensitivity probes for such particles and any exotic field that interacts with the spin of an atom. Here, we propose a multi-atom-species probe that enables not only to discover such fields and measure their spectrum but also to determine the ratios of their coupling strengths to sub-atomic elementary particles, electrons, neutrons and protons. We further show that the multi-faceted capabilities of this probe may be demonstrated with synthetic exotic fields generated by a combination of regular magnetic fields and light-induced fictitious magnetic fields in alkali atoms. These synthetic fields also enable the accurate calibration of any magnetometer or comagnetometer probe for exotic physics.</description>

Abstract: We compute the two-loop master integrals for leading-color QCD scattering amplitudes including a closed light-quark loop in $t\bar{t}H$ production at hadron colliders. Exploiting numerical evaluations in modular arithmetic, we construct a basis of master integrals satisfying a system of differential equations in $\epsilon$-factorized form. We present the analytic form of the differential equations in terms of a minimal set of differential one-forms. We explore properties of the function space of analytic solutions to the differential equations in terms of iterative integrals which can be exploited for studying the analytic form of related scattering amplitudes. Finally, we solve the differential equations using generalized series expansions to numerically evaluate the master integrals in physical phase space. As the first computation of a set of two-loop seven-scale master integrals, our results provide valuable input for analytic studies of scattering amplitudes in processes involving massive particles and a large number of kinematic scales.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum balance of dijets in Xe+Xe collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the medium modifications of the $p_T$ balance ($x_J$) of dijets in Xe+Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.44$ TeV. The initial production of dijets was carried out using the POWHEG+PYTHIA8 prescription, which matches the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD matrix elements with the parton shower (PS) effect. The SHELL model described the in-medium evolution of nucleus-nucleus collisions using a transport approach. The theoretical results of the dijet $x_J$ in the Xe+Xe collisions exhibit more imbalanced distributions than those in the p+p collisions, consistent with recently reported ATLAS data. By utilizing the Interleaved Flavor Neutralisation, an infrared-and-collinear-safe jet flavor algorithm, to identify the flavor of the reconstructed jets, we classify dijets processes into three categories: gluon-gluon ($gg$), quark-gluon ($qg$), and quark-quark ($qq$), and investigated the respective medium modification patterns and fraction changes of the $gg$, $qg$, and $qq$ components of the dijet sample in Xe+Xe collisions. It is shown that the increased fraction of $qg$ component at a small $x_J$ contributes to the imbalance of the dijet; in particular, the $q_1g_2$ (quark-jet-leading) dijets experience more significant asymmetric energy loss than the $g_1q_2$ (gluon-jet-leading) dijets traversing the QGP. By comparing the $\Delta \langle x_J\rangle = \langle x_J \rangle_{pp} - \langle x_J \rangle_{AA}$ of inclusive, $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ dijets in Xe+Xe collisions, we observe $\Delta\langle x_J \rangle_{incl.}&gt;\Delta \langle x_J \rangle_{c\bar{c}}&gt;\Delta \langle x_J \rangle_{b\bar{b}}$. Moreover, $\rho_{Xe, Pb}$, the ratios of the nuclear modification factors of dijets in Xe+Xe to those in Pb+Pb, were calculated, which indicates that the yield suppression of dijets in Pb+Pb is more pronounced than that in Xe+Xe owing to the larger radius of the lead nucleus.</description>

Abstract: The study delves into the production of (multi-)strange hadrons in proton-proton collisions at LHC. Novel observables are proposed to distinguish between EPOS4, based on core-corona separation between a thermalised QGP phase and a vacuum phase with global strangeness conservation, and PYTHIA8.3, based on microscopic interactions between Lund strings that conserve strangeness locally. Correlations between a $\phi$ meson and (multi-)strange hadrons are shown to be an excellent discriminator between the two types of models.</description>

      <title>Interpreting 95 GeV di-photon/$b\bar{b}$ excesses as a lightest Higgs boson of the MRSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model (MRSSM) is a well motivated BSM model which can accommodate the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson in agreement with electroweak precision observables, in particular with the $W$ boson mass and $T$ parameter. In the 2016 paper we showed that the SM-like 125 GeV Higgs state can be also realised as the second-to-lightest scalar of the MRSSM, leaving room for another sub-100 GeV state. Motivated by the recent ATLAS and CMS observation of the di-photon excess at a mass of around 95 GeV we investigate the possibility whether this could be the lightest CP-even MRSSM scalar in a variation of our benchmarks presented in the 2016 work. We show that such a state can also simultaneously explain the excess in the $b\bar{b}$ final state observed around the same mass value at LEP. Due to the R-symmetric nature of the model, a light singlet-like Higgs state leads necessarily to a light bino-singlino Dirac dark matter candidate, which can give a correct relic density while evading current experimental bounds. Dark matter and LHC searches place further bounds on this scenario and point to parameter regions which are viable and of interest for the LHC Run III and upcoming dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical origin of neutrino masses and dark matter from a new confining sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamical mechanism, based on a confining non-abelian dark symmetry, which generates Majorana masses for hypercharge-less fermions, is proposed. We apply it to the inverse seesaw scenario, which allows to generate light neutrino masses from the interplay of TeV-scale Pseudo-Dirac mass terms and a small explicit breaking of lepton number. A single generation of vector-like dark quarks, transforming under a $\text{SU}(3)_\text{D}$ gauge symmetry, is coupled to a real singlet scalar, which serves as a portal between the dark quark condensate and three generations of heavy sterile neutrinos. Such a dark sector and the Standard Model (SM) are kept in thermal equilibrium with each other via sizeable Yukawa couplings to the heavy neutrinos. In this framework the lightest dark baryon, which has spin $3/2$ and is stabilized at the renormalizable level by an accidental dark baryon number symmetry, can account for the observed relic density via thermal freeze-out from annihilations into the lightest dark mesons. These mesons in turn decay to heavy neutrinos, which produce SM final states upon decay. This model may be probed by next generation neutrino telescopes via neutrino lines produced from dark matter annihilations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18157v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied two different models that included LIV coupling in the scattering processes of \( e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-\). We found that using the model with the dual electromagnetic tensor \( \tilde{F}_{\mu\nu} \) resulted in violations of unitarity in both vector and axial scenarios. On the other hand, using the model with nonminimal coupling with \( F_{\mu\nu} \) preserved unitarity in both vector and axial cases. As a result, this could have significant implications, given that the nonminimal coupling model with the dual electromagnetic tensor \( \tilde{F}_{\mu\nu} \) appeared to be potentially superior to the electromagnetic tensor \( F_{\mu\nu} \). Therefore, we believe that these findings could provide a valuable guide for further exploration into the study of CPT and Lorentz breaking phenomena, with significant implications that are certainly nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Scattering amplitudes in the Randall-Sundrum model with brane-localized curvature terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the scattering amplitudes of spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in Randall-Sundrum models with brane-localized curvature terms. We show that the presence of brane-localized curvature interactions modifies the properties of (4D) scalar fluctuations of the metric, resulting in scattering amplitudes of the massive spin-2 KK states which grow as ${\cal O}(s^3)$ instead of ${\cal O}(s)$. We discuss the constraints on the size of the brane-localized curvature interactions based on the consistency of the Sturm-Liouville mode systems of the spin-2 and spin-0 metric fluctuations. We connect the properties of the scattering amplitudes to the diffeomorphism invariance of the compactified KK theory with brane-localized curvature interactions. We verify that the scattering amplitudes involving brane-localized external sources (matter) are diffeomorphism-invariant, but show that those for matter localized at an arbitrary point in the bulk are not. We demonstrate that, in Feynman gauge, the spin-0 Goldstone bosons corresponding to helicity-0 states of the massive spin-2 KK bosons behave as a tower of Galileons, and that it is their interactions that produce the high-energy behavior of the scattering amplitudes. We also outline the correspondence between our results and those in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model. In an appendix we discuss the analogous issue in extra-dimensional gauge theory, and show that the presence of a brane-localized gauge kinetic-energy term does not change the high-energy behavior of corresponding KK vector boson scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>SU(3) symmetry analysis in charmed baryon two body decays with penguin diagram contribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing number of experimental measurements from the BESIII, Belle, and Belle-II collaborations encourage investigations into charmed baryon two-body decay processes. By including contributions from the penguin diagrams that are ignored in previous studies, we perform a global analysis with SU(3) flavor symmetry. Assuming all form factors are real, we achieve a remarkable minimal $\chi^{2}/d.o.f = 0.788$ and find that the contribution of the amplitude proportional to $V_{cb}^*V_{ub}$ is of the order $\sim 0.01$, comparable with the contribution of the tree-level diagram. Additionally, by using the KPW theorem to reduce the number of amplitudes from 13 to 7 in the leading contribution, it becomes possible to consider the complex form factor case for the leading IRA amplitude in the global analysis. However, the analysis of complex form factors significantly conflicts with the experimental data $Br(\Xi_c^0\to\Xi^-\pi^+)$, and by excluding this data, $\chi^2/d.o.f$ is reduced from 5.95 to 1.19. Although the analysis of complex form factors shows a significant central value of the penguin diagram contribution, the large errors from the corresponding form factors make it a challenge to precisely determine its true contribution. Consequently, the direct CP violation in decay processes is predicted to be approximately zero. With more data in future experiments, the penguin diagram contribution with the amplitude proportional to $V_{cb}^*V_{ub}$ will be precisely determined, allowing for a more accurate prediction of CP violation. Our analysis necessitates further theoretical investigations and experimental measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>A cosmic microwave background search for fine-structure constant evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In some extensions of the standard model of particle physics, the values of the fundamental coupling constants vary in space and time. Some observations of quasars hint at time and spatial variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. Here, the Bekenstein-Sandvik-Barrow-Magueijo (BSBM) model (which posits the existence of a scalar field driving evolution in the fundamental electric charge $e$) is tested against quasar and Planck satellite cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. In this model, variations in $e$ are coupled to the matter density through a factor $\zeta_{\rm m}/{\omega}$, which is related to electromagnetic contributions to nucleon masses, and {the energy} scale of new physics. Simulations conducted here do not support claims that the electrostatic contribution to $\zeta_{m}$ is completely shielded. Other common approximations used in BSBM field evolution are found to be adequate. Principal components of the CMB data with respect to variations in $\alpha$ are used to obtain constraints of $\zeta_{\rm m}/{\omega}\lesssim 9.3 \times 10^{-9}$ for a massless field. A forecast anticipating the promise of the Simons Observatory (SO) CMB experiment shows that SO will be sensitive to values of $\zeta_{\rm m}/{\omega}\geq 2.2 \times 10^{-9}$.</description>

      <title>Negative cosmological constant in the dark energy sector: tests from JWST photometric and spectroscopic observations of high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed the existence of an unexpectedly large abundance of extremely massive galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$: these observations are in tension with the predictions not only of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, but also with those of a wide class of dynamical dark energy (DE) models, and are generally in better agreement with models characterized by a phantom behaviour. Here we consider a model, inspired by string theory and the ubiquity of anti-de Sitter vacua therein, featuring an evolving DE component with positive energy density on top of a negative cosmological constant, argued in an earlier exploratory analysis to potentially be able to explain the JWST observations. We perform a robust comparison of this model against JWST data, considering both photometric observations from the CEERS program, and spectroscopic observations from the FRESCO survey. We show that the model is able to accommodate the JWST observations, with a consistency probability of up to $98\%$, even in the presence of an evolving component with a quintessence-like behaviour (easier to accommodate theoretically compared to phantom DE), while remaining consistent with standard low-redshift probes. Our results showcase the tremendous potential of measurements of high-redshift galaxy abundances in tests of fundamental physics, and their valuable complementarity with standard cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Holographic entanglement properties in the QCD phase diagram from EMD models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behavior of entanglement properties in the QCD phase diagram using holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) models. We consider two representative holographic QCD models and examine various entanglement measures, including entanglement entropy, conditional mutual information, and entanglement of purification. We find that the entanglement entropy obtained using the direct UV-cutoff renormalization method shows significant dependence on the specific model being used. However, the outcomes of other non-divergent entanglement measures, such as cutoff-independent entanglement entropy, conditional mutual information, and entanglement of purification, exhibit congruence in our calculations. When we focus specifically on the temperature range below $300$ MeV, we observe a similar behavior among the three entanglement measures. This may suggests that within this temperature range, the entanglement of QCD matter decreases with increasing temperature. Additionally, we observe distinct phase transition behaviors of entanglement properties at the critical end point (CEP) and first-order phase transitions. This observation highlights the potential of entanglement properties as effective order parameters for QCD matter phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Infinite Order Hydrodynamics: An Analytical Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a kinetic model for matter-radiation interactions whose hydrodynamic gradient expansion can be computed analytically up to infinite order in derivatives, in the fully nonlinear regime, and for arbitrary flows. The frequency dependence of the opacity of matter is chosen to mimic the relaxation time of a self-interacting scalar field. In this way, the transient sector simulates that of a realistic quantum field theory. The gradient series is found to diverge for most flows, in agreement with previous findings. We identify, for the model at hand, the mechanism at the origin of the divergence, and we provide a successful regularization scheme. Additionally, we propose a universal qualitative framework for predicting the breakdown of the gradient expansion of an arbitrary microscopic system undergoing a given flow. This framework correctly recovers all previously known instances of gradient expansion divergence. As a new prediction, we show that the gradient expansion diverges when the energy-dependent mean free path is unbounded above.</description>

      <title>Softening of the Hypertriton Transverse Momentum Spectrum in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02701v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of hypernuclei helps to constrain the interaction between hyperon and nucleon, which is known to play an essential role in determining the properties of neutron stars. Experimental measurements have suggested that the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$), the lightest hypernucleus, exhibits a halo structure with a deuteron core encircled by a $\Lambda$ hyperon at a distance of about 10 fm. This large $\Lambda-d$ distance in $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ wave function is found to cause a suppressed $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ yield and a softening of its transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectrum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model based on nucleons and $\Lambda$ hyperons from a microscopic hybrid hydro model with a hadronic afterburner for nuclear cluster production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, we show how this softening of the hypertriton $p_T$ spectrum appears and leads to a smaller mean $p_T$ for $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ than for helium-3 ($^3$He). The latter is opposite to the predictions from the blast-wave model which assumes that $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ and $^3$He are thermally produced at the kinetic freeze-out of heavy-ion collisions. The discovered quantum mechanical softening of the (anti-)hypertriton spectrum can be experimentally tested in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies and centralities and used to obtain valuable insights into the mechanisms for light (hyper-)nuclei production in these collisions.</description>

      <title>Axions in the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark dimension scenario, which is motivated from Swampland principles and predicts a single micron scale extra dimension, suggests a consistent framework for the dark sector of the universe. We consider the implications of this scenario for the QCD axion. We find that in the scenario in which the axion is localized on the standard model brane (which we will argue is natural), a combination of theoretical (being bounded by the 5D Planck mass) and observational constraints forces it to have decay constant in a narrow range $f \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$ GeV. This corresponds to a mass for the QCD axion of $m_a \sim (1 - 10)$ meV. The axion mass surprisingly coincides with the mass scale for the dark energy, the dark matter tower, and the neutrinos. In this scenario axions are not expected to form a large fraction of the dark matter but nevertheless this range of axion parameters is accessible to observations in near future experiments.</description>

      <title>Four loop renormalization in six dimensions using Forcer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Forcer algorithm to renormalize a variety of six dimensional field theories to four loops. In order to achieve this we construct the Forcer master integrals in six dimensions from their four dimensional counterparts by using the Tarasov method. The $\epsilon$ expansion of the six dimensional masters are determined up to weight $9$ where $d$ $=$ $6$ $-$ $2\epsilon$. By applying the Forcer routine the four loop MSbar renormalization of $\phi^3$ theory is reproduced before gauge theories are considered. The renormalization of these theories is also determined in the MOMt scheme. For instance the absence of $\zeta_4$ and $\zeta_6$ is confirmed to five loops in the MOMt renormalization of $\phi^3$ theory. We also evaluate the three loop $\beta$-function of the gauge coupling in six dimensional QCD.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Green's functions in the presence of a bubble wall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field theoretical tools are developed so that one can analyze quantum phenomena such as transition radiation that must have occurred during the Higgs condensate bubble expansion through plasma in the early universe. Integral representations of Bosonic and Fermionic propagators are presented for the case that particle masses are varied continuously during the passage through the bubble wall interface between symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken regions. The construction of propagators is based on the so-called eigenfunction expansion method associated with self-adjoint differential operators, developed by Weyl, Stone, Titchmarsh, Kodaira and several others. A novel method of field quantization in the presence of the bubble wall is proposed by using the spectral functions introduced in constructing the two-point Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of covariantly constant gauge fields is infinite-dimensional and describes non-perturbative solutions of the Yang-Mills equation of superposed chromomagnetic flux tubes (vortices) of opposite magnetic charges. These gauge field configurations are stretched along the potential valleys of a constant energy density and are separated by potential barriers between classically degenerate vacua that are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of dense chromomagnetic vortices representing a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. The solutions represent exact non-perturbative solutions of the YM equation in the background chromomagnetic field.</description>
