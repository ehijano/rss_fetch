      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of spatial soliton in a Kerr micro-ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The input pump light field can be split into two transverse modes, after entering a AIN microring, which can generate rich nonlinear effects. The cross-phase modulation (XPM) effect in magnetic(TM) polarization mode can cause a refractive index alteration of the micro-ring, the electric(TE) polarization mode and TM polarization mode will display different values and generate a phase change. By adjusting the magnitude of the input TE polarization mode and TM polarization mode, we can achieve a series of phase distributions. By controlling the phase of the electromagnetic field, we can control orbital angular momentum (OAM). The traditional LLE does not take phase into account, in this paper, we obtain a generalized LLE includes phase case. Our research suitable for precision spectroscopy, optical communication links, and coherent information processing.</description>

      <title>On-chip electrically reconfigurable octave-bandwidth optical amplification from visible to near-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving broadband on-chip optical amplification spanning the visible and near-infrared (NIR) can enable diverse quantum sensing, metrology, and classical communication applications within a single unified device. However, conventional semiconductor and ion-doped amplifiers suffer from limited gain bandwidths set by fixed energy levels, while optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) operating continuously from the visible to the NIR have remained elusive due to dispersion-limited bandwidth and the high pump powers required in the visible or ultraviolet (UV). Here, we overcome these limitations by introducing an electrically reconfigurable OPA architecture on lithium niobate integrated photonics. By synergistically combining ultra-high effective $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity ($\sim$7,000\%/W-cm$^2$), high-order dispersion engineering, and local electro-thermal tuning of quasi-phase matching, our device achieves record gain spectral spanning more than an optical octave, from 770 to 1650 nm. This range covers key transitions of many photonic quantum systems and all telecommunication bands. Moreover, our approach eliminates the need for high-power, wavelength-tunable visible or UV pumps, delivering a peak on-chip gain of 23.67 dB with a single 1060 nm pump at 90 mW average on-chip power. This work opens new avenues for multi-functional, reconfigurable photonics unifying the visible and infrared regimes, with broad implications for quantum sensing and communications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Differential Pathlength Factor Model for Near-Infrared Diffuse Optical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near infrared diffuse optical imaging can be performed in reflectance and transmission mode and relies on physical models along with measurements to extract information on changes in chromophore concentration. Continuous-wave near-infrared diffuse optical imaging relies on accurate differential pathlength factors (DPFs) for quantitative chromophore estimation. Existing DPF definitions inherit formulation-dependent limitations that can introduce large errors in modified Beer--Lambert law analyses. These errors are significantly higher at smaller source-detector separations in a reflectance mode of measurement. This minimizes their applicability in situations where large area detection is used and also when signal depth is varying. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we derive two distance- and property-dependent DPF models one ideal and one experimentally practical and benchmark them against standard formulations. The proposed models achieve errors below 10 percent across broad optical conditions, whereas conventional DPFs can exceed 100 percent error. The theoretical predictions are further validated using controlled phantom experiments, demonstrating improved quantitative accuracy in CW-NIR imaging.</description>

      <title>Topology-optimized distributed 3d anisotropic Raman emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) of 3D surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates faces challenges in managing field singularities and modeling orientation-averaged anisotropic molecules. We present 3D TO for manufacturable SERS substrates that maximize spatially averaged signals from randomly oriented, anisotropic molecules in both elastic and inelastic scattering. A new trace formulation provides a closed-form rotational average of anisotropic Raman tensors, which are not equivalent to isotropic molecules because of tensor nonlinearity. Optimized silver and Si3N4 devices show that lengthscale constraints are sufficient to suppress designs that rely on unphysical mathematical field divergences at sharp corners. Metallic designs deliver broadband enhancement and remain robust to typical Raman shifts, whereas dielectric designs yield narrower, quality-factor-limited gains that are inferior to metallic designs for quality factors below about 500. Our approach readily incorporates additional physics, such as a nonlinear damage model. Together, these results provide a practical route to improved manufacturable SERS substrates and extend naturally to other distributed-emitter design problems.</description>

      <title>Microscopy of Bioelectric Potentials using Electrochromism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the electrical signals generated by living cells is key to understanding numerous biological phenomena. Electrochromic optical recording (ECORE) uses the electrochromism exhibited by certain materials to noninvasively measure these signals in real time. In this work, we report on the development of ECORE based on a high-NA microscope objective. We demonstrate the recording of extracellular action potentials from cardiomyocytes with single-cell resolution and a high sensitivity of 3 {\mu}V, which compares favorably to the previous record for any ECORE setup. Combining ECORE with microscopy simplifies the optical setup, allows for the simultaneous imaging of specimens, and makes ECORE accessible to a broader community of researchers, allowing for a better understanding of the biological processes that are integral to life.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Imaging Depth and Sensitivity in Reflectance Mode Near Infrared Optical Imaging with Scatter Reducing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of scatter reducing agents in a continuous wave (CW) near infrared (NIR)reflectance mode imaging setting. We use food-grade dye Tartrazine as a scatter reducing agent to enhance depth sensitivity and weak-absorber detectability in CW diffuse reflectance measurements. We found that reflectance signal was enhanced when the dye was applied on chicken breast phantom. However, we saw reduced reflectance sensitivity when the dye was uniformly dissolved in intralipid phantom which is a commonly used for NIR imaging studies. This shows that the gradient of refractive index modulation created as the dye diffuses from the top layer allows increased reflectance signal sensitivity of optical photons. However, when the scatter reduction is uniform throughout the phantom (like in intralipid phantom), the improved reflectance sensitivity was not observed. Our study points to significant redistribution of photons with scatter modulation with Tartrazine dye. We show significant improvement in sensitivity to signals with reflectance imaging. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of dye induced scatter reduction in tissue, analytical diffusion models and Monte Carlo simulations were employed. Modeling results show the impact of refractive index gradient created due to dye diffusion in enhancing reflectance sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that dye induced scatter reduction provides a practical, low-complexity approach to improving depth sensitivity in CW diffuse reflectance measurements and extend the functional capabilities of CW-NIRS systems for deep-tissue sensing applications. Our preliminary studies shows up to five fold enhancement in signal sensitivity for signals between two and three cm depth.</description>

      <title>High-Polarization-Extinction Raman Conversion in Gas-Filled Polarization-Maintaining Hollow-Core Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-filled hollow-core fibers (HCFs) have emerged as a versatile platform for high-power nonlinear optics, enabling phenomena from ultrafast pulse compression to broadband frequency generation. However, the lack of robust polarization control has remained a critical obstacle to the deployment of gas-based fiber sources. Here, we overcome this bottleneck by demonstrating the generation of highly-polarized Stokes light via stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in a nitrogen-filled polarization-maintaining anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (PM-HCF). By exploiting the strong structural birefringence of the fiber, the Raman interaction becomes polarization-decoupled along the principal birefringence axes, leading to threshold-selective Raman amplification and an intrinsic polarization purification mechanism. As a result, the vibrational Raman Stokes emission exhibits a polarization extinction ratio (PER) of 35 dB, even when the incident pump PER is as low as ~2 dB. Through analytical theory and numerical modeling, we validate the underlying polarization-selective Raman dynamics and identify the fiber platform as the dominant factor governing the observed PER saturation. We further show that this high polarization purity and high conversion efficiency is maintained under tight bending conditions with radii down to 5 cm, in stark contrast to conventional non-PM-HCF. These results establish PM-HCFs as a robust and scalable architecture for generating polarization-stable, frequency-shifted light, and indicate that polarization may be treated as an actively engineerable degree of freedom in gas photonics, paving the way toward deployment-ready gas-based fiber sources for precision metrology, quantum communication, and coherent sensing.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Electrode-Induced Polarization Artifacts in Miniaturized Terahertz Detectors via a Ring-Shaped Electrode Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) polarization detection provides critical insights into material properties but faces a fundamental constraint upon miniaturization: subwavelength metallic electrodes induce strong localization and distortion of the incident field, thereby convoluting the intrinsic device response with electrode-induced artifacts. Here, we overcome this limitation with a ring-shaped electrode architecture that suppresses field perturbations across a broad bandwidth from 2.0 to 5.0 THz. The resonant frequency of the ring electrode can be flexibly detuned from the target operation frequency by adjusting its inner and outer radii, while the smooth, edge-free geometry minimizes the lightning-rod effect. These design features collectively lead to a pronounced suppression of localized THz field enhancement. Numerical simulations reveal an 8.48x reduction in the local field strength compared with conventional rod-shaped electrodes. Consistent with this, experimental measurements on graphene-based detectors exhibit a 6.95x decrease in photocurrent for the ring-shaped electrode relative to the rod-shaped configuration. Moreover, the ring geometry effectively reduces the linear polarization ratio of the photocurrent from &gt;3 to &lt;1.4, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating electrode-induced polarization anisotropy. Our design decouples the detection response from electrode-induced artifacts, enabling compact THz detectors that preserve intrinsic signal fidelity for high-quality polarization-resolved imaging and diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Geometric Phase of light since 1956: A Catalog Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric phase of light is a fascinating phenomenon in optics and arises whenever there is a change in the polarization state of light. It is a fundamentally well-established concept and has recently found extensive applications, particularly in the development of geometric phase elements that enable efficient manipulation of light. In this tutorial review, we discuss the evolution of the geometric phase of polarization on the Poincar\'e sphere, from its inception by Shivaramakrishnan Pancharatnam in 1956 to its recent advances and applications. This review article aims to focus on core papers related to the geometric phase of polarization rather than providing an exhaustive literature survey. In this review, first, we introduced the basic parameters and corresponding parameter spheres involved in the geometric phase of light. Then, we provide an in-depth analysis of geometric phase in polarization modes, spatial modes, vector modes, and electromagnetic fields. A brief discussion of applications of the geometric phase is also provided. The intriguing explanation given in this review can awaken new ideas related to the geometric phase of light and can open new directions in fundamental and applied optics. Finally, the tutorial is structured as a comprehensive catalog of the geometric phase of light.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Localized Surface Plasmons in Vanadium Dioxide Nanoparticles via Size and Insulator-Metal Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide has been identified as a promising phase-changing material for use in tunable plasmonic devices. In this study, we present a comprehensive modal analysis of single-phase and multi-phase vanadium dioxide nanoparticles. In-situ high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy was utilized to experimentally resolve the dipole plasmon peak, higher-order and breathing plasmonic modes, and bulk losses as a function of nanoparticle size. Furthermore, the focus is directed toward capturing the dynamic nanoscale optical response throughout the metal-insulator transition in a vanadium dioxide nanoparticle. This system possesses the ability to be gradually switched on and off in terms of the emergence of near-infrared plasmonic absorption. The switching is accompanied by a gradual spectral shift of the absorption peak, amounting to 0.18 eV for a 120 nm nanoparticle. It is envisioned that this phenomenon can be generalized to larger nanostructures with a higher aspect ratio, thereby introducing a wider tunability of the system, which is essential for functional nanodevices based on vanadium dioxide.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Erbium-Doped Tantalum Oxide Microring Hybrid Cavity Single-Mode Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a high-performance, single-mode Er:Ta2O5 microring laser monolithically integrated on a silicon platform via a customized Damascene process. The Er:Ta2O5 gain medium exhibits a low propagation loss of 0.73 dB/cm and a high intrinsic Q-factor of 5.03 x 105. By utilizing a hybrid cavity_consisting of a microring coupled to a U-shaped waveguide at two symmetric points_we exploit the Vernier effect to achieve robust longitudinal mode selection. Under a non-resonant 1480 nm pumping scheme, the laser yields a side_mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 53.3 dB and a narrow linewidth of 9.5 pm. A slope efficiency of 2.76 % is achieved_the highest reported to date for Er:Ta2O5 lasers_with a lasing threshold of 3.3 mW. Furthermore, stable single-mode tuning is demonstrated across a temperature range of 18_68 celsius, consistently aligning with theoretical transfer matrix models. This work provides a scalable pathway for high-efficiency, tunable on-chip light sources, bridging the gap for monolithic active-passive integration on the tantalum oxide photonic platform.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution Imaging of Limited-size Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improvement of label-free far-field resolution of optical imaging is possible with prior knowledge of the object such as its sparsity or accumulated by a posteriori examination of a similar class of object1-4. We show that the sole knowledge of the object's limited size is another fundamental resource to achieve resolution beyond the Abbe-Rayleigh diffraction limit: a higher resolution can be achieved with smaller objects. To prove this, we developed an imaging method that involves the representation of light scattered from the object with orthonormal field-of-view-limited Slepian-Pollak functions and experimentally demonstrated {\lambda}/8 resolution of sub-wavelength objects. Our method requires no assumption of the shape and complexity of the object and its labelling allowing a wide range of applications in the studies of nanoparticles and isolated microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Energy Absorption Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy Absorption Interferometry (EAI) is a technique for measuring the responsivities and complex-valued spatial polarimetric forms of the individual degrees of freedom through which a many-body system can absorb energy. It was originally formulated using the language of quantum correlation functions, making it applicable to different kinds of excitation (electromagnetic, elastic and acoustic fields). EAI has been applied in a variety of theoretical and experimental ways. It is particularly effective at characterising the multimode behaviour of ultra-low-noise far-infrared and optical devices, imaging arrays, and complete instruments, where it can be used to ensure that a system is maximally responsive to those partially coherent fields that carry signal whilst avoiding those that only carry noise. Despite its utility there is no comprehensive overview of electromagnetic EAI. In this paper we describe the theoretical foundations of the method, and present a range of new techniques in areas relating to sampling, phase referencing, mode reconstruction and noise. We present, for the first time, an analysis of how noise propagates through an experiment resulting in errors and artefacts on spectral and modal plots. A noise model is essential, because it determines the signal to noise ratio needed to ensure a given level of experimental fidelity.</description>

      <title>Universality and anisotropy of the Photonic Urbach Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder in photonic crystals and waveguides creates states inside the photonic band gap. These states are often described as Lifshitz tails despite exhibiting energy distributions inconsistent with Lifshitz statistics near the band edge. Here we show that in photonic-crystal waveguides with intentionally engineered anisotropic disorder, the band-edge tail accessible experimentally follows an Urbach law universally, with cumulative statistics $F(\Delta)=\exp[-(\Delta/\alpha)^\beta]$, where $\Delta$ is the spectral detuning from the band edge, and an exponent $\beta \approx 1$ independent of disorder strength and orientation. In contrast to Lifshitz behavior, the density of states is maximal at the band edge and decays into the gap. Crucially, we find that the Urbach energy $\alpha$ is anisotropic, with a pronounced directional splitting and qualitatively different scaling for disorder parallel and perpendicular to the waveguide axis. These conclusions are supported by quantitative agreement between optical measurements of GaAs photonic-crystal waveguides and full-vector simulations. The anisotropic Urbach energy emerges as a sensitive probe of disorder-mode coupling and a practical metric to characterize structural disorder in photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient and tunable narrowband second-harmonic generation by a large-area etchless lithium niobate metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical resonances in nanostructures enable strong enhancement of nonlinear processes at the nanoscale, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), with high-$Q$ modes providing intensified light--matter interactions and sharp spectral selectivity for applications in filtering, sensing, and nonlinear spectroscopy. Thanks to the recent advances in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology, these key features can be now translated to lithium niobate for realizing novel nanoscale nonlinear optical platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large-area metasurface, realized by scalable nanoimprint lithography, comprising a slanted titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) nanograting on etchless TFLN for efficient narrowband SHG. This is enabled by the optimal coupling of quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC) modes with a narrowband pulsed laser pump. The demonstrated normalized SHG efficiency is $0.15\%\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{GW}$, which is among the largest reported for LN metasurfaces. The low pump peak intensity ($3.64~\mathrm{kW}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) employed, which enables SHG even by continuous-wave pumping, allows envisioning integrated and portable photonic applications. SHG wavelength tuning from $870$ to $920~\mathrm{nm}$ with stable output power as well as polarization control is also achieved by off-normal pump illumination. This versatile platform opens new opportunities for sensing, THz generation and detection, and ultrafast electro-optic modulation of nonlinear optical signals. Se vuoi, posso anche:</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the ultra-high-power handling capability and DC bias stability of optical microring and electro-optic (EO) coupling resonators on the thin-film lithium tantalate (TFLT) platform. We show that, with annealing, oxide-cladded TFLT resonators can handle several watts (4W) of circulating power with minimal frequency shift and no observable photo-refractive effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate a compact 2mm coupling modulator achieving a low Vpi of 3V with stable bias and phase control in the telecom C-band.</description>

      <title>Enhanced selfphase modulation in silicon nitride waveguides with integrated 2D MoS2 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip integration of 2D materials provides a promising route towards next-generation integrated optical devices with performance beyond existing limits. Here, significantly enhanced spectral broadening induced by self-phase modulation (SPM) is experimentally demonstrated in silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguides integrated with 2D monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films. Monolayer MoS2 films with ultrahigh optical nonlinearity are synthesized via low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and subsequently transferred onto Si3N4 waveguides, with precise control of the film coating length and placement achieved by selectively opening windows on the chip silica upper cladding. Detailed SPM measurements at telecom wavelengths are performed using fabricated waveguides with various MoS2 film coating lengths. Compared to devices without MoS2, increased spectral broadening of sub-picosecond optical pulses is observed for the hybrid devices, achieving a broadening factor of up to ~ 2.4 for a device with a 1.4-mm-long MoS2 film. Theoretical fitting of the experimental results further reveals an increase of up to ~27 fold in the nonlinear parameter ({\gamma}) for the hybrid MoS2 / Si3N4 waveguides and an equivalent Kerr coefficient (n2) of MoS2 nearly 5 orders of magnitude higher than Si3N4. These results confirm the effectiveness of on-chip integration of 2D MoS2 films to enhance the nonlinear optical performance of integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Metrology-grade mid-infrared spectroscopy for multi-dimensional perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared spectral window is essential for molecular fingerprinting and atmospheric sensing, yet unlocking its full potential is currently constrained by a fundamental instrumental trade-off: existing systems cannot simultaneously deliver broad bandwidth, high photon flux, and metrological frequency fidelity. Here, we resolve this bottleneck by demonstrating a metrology-grade spectroscopic system based on difference frequency generation, driven by widely tunable, near-infrared diode lasers traceable to atomic standards. Our system achieves continuous tunability across the 3-3.7 $\mu$m atmospheric window and delivers output power exceeding 45 mW with an absolute frequency accuracy of 7.2 MHz. We harness this convergence to overcome a critical barrier in integrated photonics, unambiguously identifying and eliminating hydrogen-induced absorption in silicon nitride microresonators to achieve an 88-fold reduction in optical loss. We further reveal multi-phonon absorption in the silica cladding as the fundamental limit to mid-infrared integrated photonics. Finally, we demonstrate the system's versatility through scattering-resilient LiDAR capable of penetrating optically dense fog, and dual-modality sensing that simultaneously retrieves target distance and chemical composition. By unifying the rigor of frequency metrology with the versatility of broadband sensing, this architecture establishes a new paradigm for multi-dimensional perception in complex environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a core technology enabling the transition of artificial intelligence (AI) from perception to decision-making, but its deployment on conventional electronic hardware suffers from high latency and energy consumption imposed by the von Neumann architecture. Here, we propose a photonic spiking twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning architecture for neuromorphic autonomous navigation and experimentally validate it on a distributed feedback laser with a saturable absorber (DFB-SA) array. The hybrid architecture integrates a photonic spiking Actor network with dual continuous-valued Critic networks, where the final nonlinear spiking activation layer of the Actor is deployed on the DFB-SA laser array. In autonomous navigation tasks, the system achieves an average reward of 58.22 plus-minus 17.29 and a success rate of 80% plus-minus 8.3%. Hardware-software co-inference demonstrates an estimated energy consumption of 0.78 nJ/inf and an ultra-low latency of 191.20 ps/inf, with co-inference error rates of 0.051% and 0.059% in task scenarios with and without obstacle interference, respectively. Simulations for error-activated channels show full agreement with the expected responses, validating the dynamic characteristics of the DFB-SA laser. The architecture shows strong potential for integration with large-scale photonic linear computing chips, enabling fully-functional photonic computation and low-power, low-latency neuromorphic autonomous navigation.</description>

      <title>Photonic spiking reinforcement learning for intelligent routing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent routing plays a key role in modern communication infrastructure, including data centers, computing networks, and future 6G networks. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for intelligent routing, its practical deployment remains constrained by high energy consumption and decision latency. Here, we propose a photonic spiking RL architecture that implements a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based intelligent routing algorithm. The performance of the proposed approach is systematically evaluated on a software-defined network (SDN) with a fat-tree topology. The results demonstrate that, under various baseline traffic rate conditions, the PPO-based routing strategy significantly outperforms the conventional Dijkstra algorithm in several key performance metrics. Furthermore, a hardware-software collaborative framework of the spiking Actor network is realized for three typical baseline traffic rates, utilizing a photonic synapse chip based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) array and a photonic spiking neuron chip based on distributed feedback lasers with a saturable absorber (DFB-SAs). Experimental validation on 640 state-action pairs shows that the inference accuracy of the hardware-software collaborative framework is consistent with that of the pure algorithmic implementation. The impacts of different hidden-layer scales in the spiking Actor network and varying network size of fat-tree topology are further analyzed. The integration of photonic spiking RL with SDN-based routing establishes a novel paradigm for intelligent routing optimization, featuring ultra-low latency and high energy efficiency. This approach exhibits broad application prospects in real-time network optimization scenarios, including large-scale data centers, computing networks, satellite Internet systems, and future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Light and Sound Driven Wavefront Shaping and Imaging through Scattering Tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep, high-resolution imaging is essential for unraveling biological complexity and advancing medical diagnostics, yet scattering fundamentally limits optical methods. Among the most promising approaches, photoacoustic imaging achieves penetration into deep tissue but with coarse resolution, while fluorescence provides subcellular detail but is confined to shallow depths. This depth-resolution trade-off remains a central barrier to biomedical imaging. To bridge this fundamental gap, we present a hybrid dual-modal strategy that combines the benefits of photoacoustic and fluorescence modalities. Our approach leverages hybrid opto-acoustic feedback for wavefront shaping and computational imaging through scattering media. By combining these complementary signals into a nonlinear feedback metric, we achieve robust optical focusing even under signal degradation. In particular, we show that photoacoustic-guided wavefront shaping inherently generates fluorescence that can be harvested for computational high-resolution imaging even within highly scattering biological tissues, thereby leveraging the complementary strengths of both modalities in a single framework. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate this synergistic approach, paving the way for optical imaging techniques that fully leverage the potential of such dual-modalities for large depth penetration and high resolution in complex biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Discord-Enabled Teleportation-Inspired Optical Imaging at a Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum teleportation, a pair of entangled photons are prerequisite to serve as the quantum channel for quantum state transfer distantly. Here, we report a new strategy of quantum-teleportation-inspired classical optical imaging, which also works non-locally at a distance; however, only a classically correlated light source is used instead of entanglement. In our experiment, we explore the pseudo-thermal light source to offer the teleportation-like channel and employ the sum-frequency generation to perform the Bell-like state measurement. We successfully demonstrate the teleportation-inspired optical imaging of simple characters, Taiji diagram, and the superposition of orbital angular momentum modes. Moreover, we experimentally observe that a better coherence of pseudo-thermal light will result in a lower contrast of the formed images, and thus revealing that non-zero quantum discord offered by pseudo-thermal light, regardless of zero entanglement, plays the pivotal role in sustaining the teleportation-like channel for imaging at a distance.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Quantification of the Dark-Exciton Reservoir via a k-Space-Folding Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-forbidden dark excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides constitute a dominant hidden reservoir that governs exciton dynamics and many-body interactions. Yet determining the population distribution within this reservoir remains challenging because detected brightness conflates radiative-rate modification with collection efficiency, obscuring the link between intensity and population. Here we make this inverse problem well posed by calibrating the position- and orientation-resolved detection response. Combining microsphere-enabled k-space folding with Green-tensor quasinormal-mode calibration, we decouple radiative-rate modification from collection efficiency. We extract a room-temperature dark-to-bright population ratio ND/NB = 4.3, consistent with a near-thermalized manifold under continuous-wave excitation. This calibrated population metric provides a quantitative thermodynamic benchmark for the dark reservoir and interaction-driven 2D exciton phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light propagating in an optical waveguide can gain or lose power through interaction with a travelling acoustic wave or radio-frequency modulation of permittivity. Here, we model this propagation by considering an optical wave interacting with a weak travelling-wave permittivity perturbation whose frequency is much smaller than the optical frequency and whose amplitude decays exponentially along the propagation direction. Four modulation cases are analyzed: instantaneous modulation, synchronous modulation, and the Stokes and anti-Stokes resonances. For these cases, simple expressions are obtained for the carrier and sideband transmission and reflection powers as well as for the total gain and loss powers. Although the achievable total gain remains small for realistic modulation and waveguide parameters, the anti-Stokes resonance is identified as the most promising condition for observing modulation-induced light amplification.</description>

      <title>Topologically robust programmable logic arrays using light and matter skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic computing offers a low-power, high-bandwidth paradigm for information processing; however, the analogue nature of conventional architectures means that intrinsic noise and fabrication imperfections greatly impact performance, thereby severely limiting scalability. Recent work on optical skyrmions offers a route to overcoming these limitations by exploiting perturbation-resilient topological invariants assigned to the optical field for computation. However, owing to its relative novelty, an architectural perspective on integrating individual components that manipulate topological charge into a functional system remains an important open goal. In this paper, we take concrete steps toward system-level design by introducing a platform-independent architecture for skyrmion-based logic, built around a modular library of topologically robust optical primitives, including generators, converters, registers, and adders. This framework enables the synthesis and arithmetic manipulation of topological numbers within a unified programmable architecture. We then experimentally validate this approach using multichannel arrays, demonstrating accurate charge readout and high robustness against alignment errors and environmental noise. These results provide a scalable foundation for topologically robust programmable logic arrays, paving the way for compact and integrated photonic processing circuits.</description>

      <title>Full-span reversible space-time birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Birefringence, the polarization-dependent splitting of light in anisotropic crystals, enables diverse optical phenomena and advanced functionalities such as optical communication, nonlinear optics, and quantum optics. However, conventional methods for controlling birefringence typically rely on engineering the optical crystal structure or applying external stimuli such as electric fields, mechanical stress or thermal variations, which are often constrained by limited tunability, challenges in integration with compact photonic devices or slow response time. Here, we introduce a new degree of freedom to manipulate the birefringence of light propagation in optical crystals through programming the spatiotemporal spectral phase of the incident light wave. We demonstrate this approach achieves continuous tuning of birefringence across a spectrum more than 100 times broader than that achievable with conventional birefringence tuning, spanning from positive through zero to negative values, irrespective of the crystal's optical sign and without inherent physical limitations. This unique optical behavior provides a versatile platform for investigating the complex dynamics of wave flow in anisotropic media, while the broad tunability of this space-time birefringence will spur innovations in ultrafast optical manipulation, optical computation, and quantum information processing-applications that demand rapid and flexible device reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>TF-UNet: Resolving Complex Speckles for Single-Shot Reconstruction of 512^2-Matrix Images Using a Micron-Sized Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tapered optical fibers (TFs), with diameters gradually reduced from hundreds of microns to the micron scale, offer key advantages over conventional flat optical fibers (FFs), including uniform illumination, efficient long-range signal collection, and minimal invasiveness for applications in high-sensitivity biosensing, optogenetics, and photodynamic therapy. However, high-fidelity, single-shot imaging through a single TF remains underexplored due to intermodal coupling from the tapering geometry, which distorts output speckle patterns and poses challenges for image reconstruction using existing deep learning methods. Here, we propose a physics-inspired TF-UNet architecture that augments skip connections with hierarchical grouped-MLP fusion to effectively capture non-local, cross-scale dependencies caused by intermodal coupling in TFs. We experimentally validate our method on both FFs and TFs, demonstrating that TF-UNet outperforms standard U-Net variants in structural and perceptual fidelity while maintaining competitive PSNR at quadratic complexity. Our study offers a promising approach for deep learning-based imaging through micron-sized, ultrafine optical fibers, enabling scanning-free single-shot reconstruction on a 512x512 reconstruction matrix, and further validating the framework on biologically meaningful neuronal and vascular datasets for physically interpretable characterization.</description>

      <title>Tilt-to-length coupling metrology in the LISA mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a setup aimed at measuring the so-called Tilt-To-Length (TTL) coupling in the optical benches of the LISA mission. The TTL is the coupling of the angular jitter of any optical setup into the optical path length between its input and output pupils. This might be deleterious in laser ranging experiments and must be evaluated for further compensation. The setup is made of two laser beams, one features an angular jitter that mimics the input beam as seen from the jittering bench under test (BUT), the other is aligned to the optical axis of the BUT and provides a phase reference for the jittering beam. The induced phase variations between both beams detected at the BUT's output pupil gives access to the TTL coupling. The ''TTL probe'' must feature a negligible residual TTL coupling which implies a micrometric accuracy in the centering of the setup pupil, the beams and the angular jitter associated pivot point. The setup integrates optical masks as a link between the setup optical reference frame to its mechanical reference frame, together with position memories and servo-loops for the beam's alignment. We show that the stability, the accuracy, and the noise floor of the setup is compliant with the LISA specifications for the TTL mitigation, although it makes use of off-the-shelf components and is operated in a standard environment laboratory.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Control and Intensity Modulation of Third Harmonic Generation in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have emerged as a promising platform for integrated nonlinear optics. Nonlocal metasurfaces enable high nonlinear conversion efficiency, while the local ones can offer versatile wavefront control, yet achieving both within a single metasurface remains challenging. Here, using a nonlocal phase gradient metasurface, we firstly demonstrate efficient third harmonic generation (THG) with polarization-dependent wavefront control. Leveraging nonlocal nonlinear geometric phase existing at resonance, the third harmonic light with distinct polarizations is deflected into $\pm$ 2nd and $\pm$ 4th diffraction orders, simultaneously achieving a conversion efficiency up to $1.45\times 10^{-4}$ under a pump intensity of $1 GW/cm^{2}$. Then, by introducing a secondary fundamental beam, whose generated third harmonic light overlaps with that of the first beam, the intensity modulation of THG is obtained. The THG efficiency can be tuned from $3.9 \times 10^{-9}$ to $5.5 \times 10^{-3}$ by varying the relative phase, polarization and intensity of two fundamental beams. Through utilizing the advantages of both local and nonlocal metasurfaces, our results effectively pave the way to on-chip nonlinear photonic devices and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Meta-optical processors for broadband complex-field image operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical image processing provides a fast and energy-efficient alternative to conventional electronic systems by directly manipulating optical wavefronts. However, metasurface-based optical processors reported to date are often limited in functionality, operating bandwidth, or input modality, which restricts their adaptability across different image processing tasks. Here, we demonstrate a broadband metasurface platform capable of performing diverse analog image processing operations on both amplitude- and phase-encoded inputs. This platform is realized using a single-layer dielectric metasurface designed through an end-to-end, task-driven inverse design framework. By tailoring the spatial-frequency components of incident image wavefronts, the metasurface implements analog operations such as edge detection and pattern recognition across a 200nm wavelength bandwidth in the visible spectrum. Furthermore, we develop a compact processor architecture that integrates imaging and computation within a reduced optical footprint. These results establish a flexible and compact metasurface-based optical processor with strong potential for integration into practical imaging and optical computing systems.</description>

      <title>Mie Voids as broadband directional light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kerker effect arises from the interference between electric and magnetic multipoles, enabling directional light scattering in nanophotonics. However, conventional dielectric and plasmonic nanoparticles can only act as Kerker sources in narrow spectral regions, limiting their applicability. Here, we show that the recently discovered Mie voids overcome this limitation by supporting a broadband generalized Kerker effect spanning the whole visible range. We investigate the optical response of Mie voids under both plane-wave and dipolar excitation. For plane waves, the voids preferentially scatter light in the forward direction. Under dipolar excitation, the resulting radiation emission towards the void and beyond is suppressed due to destructive interference between the dipole field with the directional scattered field of the void. These findings identify Mie voids as versatile broadband directional sources, opening pathways for antenna design and energy harvesting at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>A T-matrix database to promote information-driven research in nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-driven methods from machine learning and artificial intelligence for exploring the optical response of metasurfaces and, more generally, photonic systems rely on well-annotated datasets for training. For metasurfaces made from a periodic or aperiodic arrangement of scatterers, the primary information encoding their response is the optical properties of these individual scatterers. In the linear regime, that response is entirely contained in the transition or T-matrix of the individual scatterer. However, despite the widespread use of these T-matrices in exploring advanced photonic materials within the larger community, there is no common infrastructure for distributing them with consistent metadata and a standard representation. That would be important to avoid the repetitive, resource-intensive computation of these T-matrices by researchers worldwide and to enable data-driven research. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Daphona T-matrix portal at https://tmatrix.scc.kit.edu/, a web-based platform for interactive searching, filtering, and exporting standardized data containing structure-property relations for a wide range of scatterers, as expressed by their T-matrices. Besides introducing this infrastructure, we demonstrate how the available data enables addressing scientific questions in the broader context of information-driven research. The multiple illustrative examples in our contribution cover both surrogate forward models and inverse design models, and operate either directly on the T-matrix or alternatively on optical observables of metasurfaces made from these scatterers.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable dipolar polaritons with giant nonlinearity in a homobilayer microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active control over strong optical nonlinearity in solid-state systems is central to unlocking exotic many-body phenomena and scalable photonic devices. While exciton-polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer a promising platform, their practical utility is often impeded by fixed interaction parameters and an intrinsic trade-off between nonlinearity and oscillator strength. Here, we report electrically tunable dipolar polaritons in a dual-gated bilayer MoS2 microcavity, demonstrating in situ reshaping of the dispersion and modulation of the light-matter coupling strength via the quantum-confined Stark effect. Crucially, this architecture enables a giant polariton-polariton interaction strength tunable by a factor of seven. This nonlinearity enhancement arises from a synergistic interplay, in which the electric field amplifies the microscopic dipolar repulsion while simultaneously optimizing the macroscopic excitonic Hopfield coefficient. Furthermore, electrostatic doping serves as an independent control knob to switch the system between strong and weak coupling regimes. Our findings bridge the gap between strong optical coupling and giant dipolar nonlinearities, establishing the TMD homobilayer as a versatile platform for engineering programmable correlated many-body states on a chip.</description>

      <title>Impact of interference between two infrared pulses driving high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) interferometry is technically challenging to implement. One approach to generating interference between two XUV pulses relies on driving high-harmonic generation in a gas jet with two collinearly overlapping infrared laser pulses. We investigate this scheme through a combined experimental and theoretical study, with particular emphasis on the regime of temporal overlap between the driving pulses. A special phase-modulation interferometry technique is implemented to increase the sensitivity for the comprehensive mapping of the strong-field induced high-order nonlinear response. We find that the dynamics arising from the interference of the two electric fields can be adequately described by the non-perturbative model developed by Lewenstein and co-workers.</description>

      <title>Numerically optimized FROG results for the study of red-shifted spectra in multi-frequency Raman generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When multifrequency Raman scattering is driven in the transient regime by two chirped pump pulses, the resulting anti-Stokes orders exhibit asymmetric spectral broadening toward lower frequencies, leading to a characteristic double-peaked structure in each order. In this Letter, frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) is used to investigate the spectral evolution of the first anti-Stokes Raman component. To interpret the observed features, we introduce a double-pulse interference model and employ an adaptive learning-based reconstruction algorithm using the Adam optimizer to retrieve the temporal field evolution. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental measurements. Our analysis indicates that the observed red-shifted spectral component originates from linear Raman processes within the two-photon dressed-state framework.</description>

Abstract: Satellite-based quantum communications represent a critical advancement in the pursuit of secure, global-scale quantum networks. Leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, these systems offer unparalleled security through Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and other quantum communication protocols. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of satellite-based quantum communications, focusing on the evolution from terrestrial to space-based systems. We explore the distinct advantages and challenges of discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) quantum communication technologies in the context of satellite deployments. The paper also discusses key milestones such as the successful implementation of quantum communication via the Micius satellite and outlines the primary challenges, including atmospheric turbulence and the development of quantum repeaters, that must be addressed to achieve a global quantum internet. This review aims to consolidate recent advancements in the field, providing insights and perspectives on the future directions and potential innovations that will drive the continued evolution of satellite-based quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Energy-Transfer-Enhanced Emission and Quantum Sensing of VB- Defects in hBN-PbI2 Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin defects in two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for quantum information technologies and sensing applications. The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted considerable attention as a quantum sensor due to its demonstrated sensitivity to temperature, magnetic fields, and pressure.1 However, its applications have thus far been limited by inherently dim photoluminescence (PL). By fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure with a sensitizing donor layer, lead iodide (PbI2), we effectively enhance the PL intensity from the VB- by 5-45x, while maintaining compatibility with other heterostructures and vdW optoelectronic platforms. The type-I band alignment at the heterojunction enables efficient exciton migration while suppressing back-electron transfer, and the strong spectral overlap between the PbI2 emission and defect absorption supports efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) predicts a photon-ratcheting mechanism that boosts absorption and emission while maintaining magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast through minimal hybridization. Experimentally, the heterostructure exhibits enhanced continuous-wave ODMR sensitivity and functions as a precise probe of external magnetic fields. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for amplifying weak defect signals in nanomaterials, highlighting a new strategy for engineering their optical and magnetic responses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defect-based quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising building blocks for scalable quantum photonics due to their stable single-photon emission at room temperature. However, enhancing their emission intensity and controlling the decay dynamics remain significant challenges. This study demonstrates a low-cost, scalable fabrication approach to integrate plasmonic nanocavities with defect-based quantum emitters in hBN nanoflakes. Using the thermal dewetting process, we realize two distinct configurations: stochastic Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) on hBN flakes and hybrid plasmonic nanocavities formed by AgNPs on top of hBN flakes supported on gold/silicon dioxide (Au/SiO2) substrates. While AgNPs on bare hBN yield up to a two-fold photoluminescence (PL) enhancement with reduced emitter lifetimes, the hybrid nanocavity architecture provides a dramatic, up to 100-fold PL enhancement and improved uniformity across multiple. emitters, all without requiring deterministic positioning. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and time-resolved PL measurements confirm size-dependent control over decay dynamics and cavity-emitter interactions. Our versatile solution overcomes key quantum photonic device development challenges, including material integration, emission intensity optimization, and spectral multiplexity. Future work will explore potential applications in integrated photonic circuits hosting on-chip quantum systems and hBN-based label-free single-molecule detection through such quantum nanoantennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder can profoundly influence synchronization in networks of nonlinear oscillators, sometimes enhancing coherence through external tuning. In semiconductor lasers, however, achieving high-quality steady-state synchronization is desired, while intrinsic and typically uncontrollable disorder poses a major challenge. Under fixed frequency disorder, we investigate homogeneous fully coupled external-cavity semiconductor lasers governed by the complex, time-delayed Lang-Kobayashi equations with experimentally relevant parameters and identify an optimal coupling strength that maximizes steady-state synchronization in the weak-coupling regime, which we term disorder-mediated synchronization resonance. This optimum appears for any fixed configuration of intrinsic frequency detuning and scales inversely with the number of lasers, leading to a linear scaling of the total coupling cost with the number of lasers. A theory based on an effective thermodynamic potential explains this disorder-mediated optimization, revealing a general mechanism by which moderate coupling can overcome static heterogeneity in nonlinear physical systems.</description>

      <title>High-speed optical microscopy for neural voltage imaging: Methods, trade-offs, and opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-speed optical imaging of dynamic neuronal activity is essential yet challenging in neuroscience. While calcium imaging has been firmly established as a workhorse technique for monitoring neuronal activity, its limited temporal resolution and indirect measurement restrict its ability to capture rapid inhibitory and excitatory events and subthreshold voltage oscillations. In contrast, voltage imaging directly measures membrane potential fluctuations, providing a comprehensive and precise representation of neuronal circuit dynamics. Recent advancements in voltage-sensitive dyes and, particularly, genetically encoded voltage indicators have significantly enhanced the feasibility of voltage imaging, prompting the development of advanced fluorescence microscopy methods optimized for high-speed acquisition. However, achieving millisecond-scale temporal resolution remains challenging due to inherent trade-offs among imaging speed, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Conventional raster-scanning approaches, including confocal microscopy, are fundamentally limited by their slow frame rates, precluding the capture of rapid neuronal events from multiple neurons simultaneously. Alternative techniques such as random-access scanning, spatiotemporal multiplexing, and computational optical imaging have successfully addressed these constraints, enabling kilohertz-level imaging of neuronal activity in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional contexts. This review summarizes recent progress in high-speed optical microscopy for voltage imaging and discusses its transformative potential for neuroscience research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a LiNbO3 metasurface for electro-optic modulation of light polarization in the telecommunication band. High-Q quasi-bound states in the continuum are emploied to enhance the modulation of amplitude and phase of an impinging beam by a driving electric field, leading to efficient polarization rotation and conversion. We quantified modulation effects under a CMOS-compatible bias at 1 MHz frequency, achieving a variation of 5% in the Stokes parameters and a variation of the polarization ellipse angles of about 3{\deg} for the transmitted light. These results demonstrate that dynamic polarization and phase modulation can be attained in a compact platform, highlighting the potential of high-Q resonant LiNbO3 metasurfaces for enhanced light-matter interaction in subwavelength electro-optic devices.</description>

Abstract: A broadband silicon polarization beam splitter (PBS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated based on Floquet-engineered directional couplers. The total length of the coupling structure is 20 um . By periodically modulating the waveguide width of the directional couplers, the power exchange between the two waveguides for the transverse-electric (TE) mode is suppressed, whereas the power coupling for the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode is enhanced. The fabricated PBS exhibits polarization extinction ratios (PERs) &gt; 20 dB for both polarizations over a broad wavelength range of 1483 nm-1620 nm. Additionally, the measured insertion losses (ILs) are 0.15 dB and 1.2 dB at 1550 nm for TE and TM polarizations, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Coherent detection ghost imaging lidar (CD-GI lidar) integrates ghost imaging with coherent detection, thereby achieving enhanced anti-interference and phase-resolved imaging capability. Here, we propose a bucket-detector-based multi-mode coherent detection scheme for CD-GI lidar, where the reflected multi-mode light fields are coherently mixed with a single-mode local oscillator (LO) at the bucket detector photosensitive plane. The bucket-detector-based multi-mode CD-GI lidar system breaks the constraints of Siegman antenna theorem by utilizing field correlation to decouple the reflected multi-mode light fields and reconstructs the spatial distribution of targets' vibration modes. Theoretical analysis of the bucket-detector-based multi-mode CD-GI lidar system is presented in this work, and its feasibility is verified through a series of experiments.</description>

      <title>Integrated Photonic Quantum Computing: From Silicon to Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum technologies have surpassed classical systems by leveraging the unique properties of superposition and entanglement in photons and matter. Recent advancements in integrated quantum photonics, especially in silicon-based and lithium niobate platforms, are pushing the technology toward greater scalability and functionality. Silicon circuits have progressed from centimeter-scale, dual-photon systems to millimeter-scale, high-density devices that integrate thousands of components, enabling sophisticated programmable manipulation of multi-photon states. Meanwhile, lithium niobate, thanks to its wide optical transmission window, outstanding nonlinear and electro-optic coefficients, and chemical stability, has emerged as an optimal substrate for fully integrated photonic quantum chips. Devices made from this material exhibit high efficiency in in generating, manipulating, converting, storing, and detecting photon states, thereby establishing a basis for deterministic multi-photon generation and single-photon quantum interactions, as well as comprehensive frequency-state control. This review explores the development of integrated photonic quantum technologies based on both silicon and lithium niobate, highlighting invaluable insights gained from silicon-based systems that can assist the scaling of lithium niobate technologies. It examines the functional integration mechanisms of lithium niobate in electro-optic tuning and nonlinear energy conversion, showcasing its transformative impact throughout the photonic quantum computing process. Looking ahead, we speculate on the developmental pathways for lithium niobate platforms and their potential to revolutionize areas such as quantum communication, complex system simulation, quantum sampling, and optical quantum computing paradigms.</description>

      <title>Moderate-terahertz-induced plateau expansion of high-order harmonic generation to soft X-ray region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the high-harmonic cutoff with experimentally accessible fields is essential for advancing tabletop coherent extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray sources. Although terahertz (THz) assistance offers a promising route, cutoff extension at weak, laboratory-accessible THz strengths remain poorly understood. In this report, we comprehensively investigate THz-assisted high-order harmonic generation (HHG) using time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation simulations supported by classical trajectory analysis and Bohmian-based quantum dynamics. By mapping the plateau evolution versus THz strength, we show that even weak THz fields can extend the cutoff, producing a pronounced ``fish-fin'' structure whose prominent rays saturate near $I_p + 8 U_p$. We trace this extension to long electron excursions spanning several optical cycles before recombination, and provide a fully consistent explanation using both classical analysis and Bohmian trajectories flow. Our findings reveal that this cutoff-extension mechanism is remarkably robust, persisting across different atomic species and remaining insensitive to variations in the driving parameters. These results demonstrate that cutoff control is achievable with laboratory-scale THz fields, offering practical guidelines for engineering coherent high-energy HHG, and providing a robust pathway for tracking ultrafast electron motion in real time.</description>

      <title>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $\Lambda$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven developments in lensless imaging, such as machine learning-based reconstruction algorithms, require large datasets. In this work, we introduce a data acquisition pipeline that can capture from multiple lensless imaging systems in parallel, under the same imaging conditions, and paired with computational ground truth registration. We provide an open-access 25,000 image dataset with two lensless imagers, a reproducible hardware setup, and open-source camera synchronization code. Experimental datasets from our system can enable data-driven developments in lensless imaging, such as machine learning-based reconstruction algorithms and end-to-end system design.</description>

      <title>Compactifying linear optical unitaries using multiport beamsplitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any $N$-dimensional unitary matrix can be realized using a finite sequence of concatenated identical fixed multiport beamsplitters (MBSs) and phase shifters (PSs). Our construction is based on a Lie group theorem applied to existing decompositions. Using the Bell-Walmsley-Clements framework, we prove that any $N$-dimensional unitary requires $N+2$ phase masks, $N-1$ fixed MBSs, and $N-1$ BSs. Our scheme requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ fixed, identical components (MBSs and BSs) compared to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ fixed BSs required by conventional schemes (e.g., Clements), all while keeping the same number of PSs. Experimentally, these MBS can be realized as a monolithic element via femtosecond laser writing, offering superior performance through reduced insertion losses. As an application, we present a reconfigurable linear optical circuit that implements a three-dimensional unitary emerging in the unambiguous discrimination of two nonorthogonal qubit states.</description>

      <title>Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</description>

      <title>Quantum synchronization between two strongly driven YIG spheres mediated via a microwave cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of synchronization between two strongly driven magnon modes indirectly coupled via a single-mode microwave cavity. Each magnon mode, hosted in separate Yttrium Iron Garnet spheres, interacts coherently with the cavity field, leading to cavity-mediated nonlinear coupling. We show, by using input-output formalism, that both classical and quantum synchronization emerge for appropriate choices of coupling, detuning, and driving. We find that thermal noise reduces quantum synchronization, highlighting the importance of low-temperature conditions. This study provides useful insights into tunable magnonic interactions in cavity systems, with possible applications in quantum information processing and hybrid quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a quantum heat engine using a setup consisting of a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate placed in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity where the optical field carries orbital angular momentum. We first show that the cavity-enhanced light-atom coupling leads to the emergence of polaritonic modes whose character can be reversibly switched between photonlike and phononlike by detuning sweeps, allowing work extraction governed by distinct reservoirs. We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the orbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios based on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its ideal-operation value, despite finite-time operation. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as a control knob that can reconfigure the performance of such quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Modeling Quantum Noise in Nanolasers using Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The random nature of spontaneous emission leads to unavoidable fluctuations in a laser's output. This is often included through random Langevin forces in laser rate equations, but this approach falls short for nanolasers. In this paper, we show that the laser quantum noise can be quantitatively computed for a very broad class of lasers by starting from simple and intuitive rate equations and merely assuming that the number of photons and excited electrons only takes discrete values. While the approach has seen previous success, we here derive it rigorously from an open quantum system master equation, whereas it was previously introduced only on phenomenological grounds. We further show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we show that below the laser threshold, stochastic fluctuations in the numerical solution to the Langevin equations can drive populations to unphysical negative values, requiring the introduction of population bounds, which in turn skew the noise statistics, leading to inaccuracies. The Laser Markov Chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded.</description>
