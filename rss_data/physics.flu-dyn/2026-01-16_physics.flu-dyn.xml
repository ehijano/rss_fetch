      <title>Comparative study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium predictions by different models for a hypersonic cone at high-altitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeting a cone with the half-angle as 10-deg at M = 27 and H = 72 km, simulations were conducted comparatively to analyze the predictions by different equilibrium and non-equilibrium gas models. Following validation and grid studies, systematic comparisons on aerodynamic performance, flow structures, and characteristic distributions were performed. The key findings are: (1) While the overall flow structures are broadly similar, discrepancies exist in the features at the base locations, e.g., the diverse high-temperature distributions. Notably, the vibrational temperatures distribute differently under slip and non-slip boundary conditions near the wall; (2) The equilibrium gas model predicts higher drag coefficient, wall heat flux, and skin friction than those of non-equilibrium models. Predictions also vary among the non-equilibrium models themselves. Specifically, compared to the three-temperature model, the one- and two-temperature models predict larger drag coefficients with the relative difference exceeding 5%. Nevertheless, the results from the three-temperature model with and without slip conditions are largely consistent; (3) The disparities between equilibrium and non-equilibrium characteristics are primarily manifested in the shock layer and wake regions. Within these regions, the overall temperature for the equilibrium gas is lower than that for the non-equilibrium cases, while in the latter specific non-equilibrium features are distinctly exhibited, e.g., the translational-rotational temperature is generally higher than that from the one-temperature model, and the vibrational-electronic temperature shows the opposite trend. Notably, in the slip flow within the three-temperature model, the translational-rotational temperature is higher and, particularly, the vibrational temperature is even larger than counterparts of the non-slip flows near the wall and base center line.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Selection for Complex Flows of Yield Stress Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling yield stress fluids in complex flow scenarios presents significant challenges, particularly because conventional rheological characterization methods often yield material parameters that are not fully representative of the intricate constitutive behavior observed in complex conditions. We propose a Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework for the calibration and selection of constitutive models for yield stress fluids, explicitly accounting for uncertainties in both modeling accuracy and experimental observations. The framework addresses the challenge of complex flow modeling by making discrepancies that emanate from rheological measurements explicit and quantifiable. We apply the Bayesian framework to rheological measurements and squeeze flow experiments on Carbopol 980. Our analysis demonstrates that Bayesian model selection yields robust probabilistic predictions and provides an objective assessment of model suitability through evaluated plausibilities. The framework naturally penalizes unnecessary complexity and shows that the optimal model choice depends on the incorporated physics, the prior information, and the availability of data. In rheological settings, the Herschel-Bulkley and biviscous power law models perform well. However, when these rheological outcomes are used as prior information for a rheo-informed squeeze flow analysis, a significant mismatch with the experimental data is observed. This is due to the yield stress inferred from rheological measurements not being representative of the complex squeeze flow case. In contrast, an expert-informed squeeze flow analysis, based on broader priors, yields accurate predictions. These findings highlight the limitations of translating rheological measurements to complex flows and underscore the value of Bayesian approaches in quantifying model bias and guiding model selection under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Volume penalization method for simulating flows around a rotating solid with multiple reference frame and sliding mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the significant role of turbomachinery in fluid-based energy transfer, precise simulation of rotating solid objects with complex geometry is a challenging task. In the present study, the volume penalization method (VPM) is combined with multiple reference frame (MRF) and sliding mesh (SLM), respectively, so as to develop immersed-boundary approaches for simulating flows around a rotating solid. The level-set function is adopted to represent arbitrary geometries embedded in Cartesian grids. The VPM body-forcing terms in the momentum equation are proposed for MRF and SLM, respectively, so as to build unified governing equations for both fluid and solid regions. The flows around a rotating cuboid under various rotating speeds are simulated by the present schemes, namely, VPM with MRF, and VPM with SLM, and compared to corresponding simulations by the body-fitted method (BFM). The results suggest the relative deviations of predicted pressure drop and torque between the present VPM and BFM are around 5%, demonstrating the validity of the present VPM.</description>

      <title>Scale Collapse of Vortices at Porous-Fluid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between externally generated turbulence and porous media is central to many engineering and environmental flows, yet the fate of macroscale vortical structures at a porous/fluid interface remains uncharacterized. By numerically simulating the turbulent flow, we investigate the penetration, breakdown, and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) transport of macroscale vortices impinging on porous matrices with high porosities $\phi$ = 0.80-0.95. For all porosities considered, macroscale vortices collapse abruptly at the porous interface and do not persist within the matrix, supporting the pore-scale prevalence of turbulence even under strong external forcing. Although vortex impingement injects TKE into the porous medium through turbulent transport at the interface, this supplied TKE is rapidly redistributed and dissipated as the flow reorganizes to satisfy pore-scale geometric constraints. Deeper within the porous layer, turbulence is sustained primarily by local shear production associated with pore-scale velocity gradients, and the internal flow becomes increasingly independent of upstream conditions. Variations in porosity modulate the relative balance between production and dissipation by altering geometric confinement and effective Reynolds number, but the dominant turbulent length scale within the porous matrix remains set by the pore size. These results demonstrate that porous media act as a robust geometric filter that enforces pore-scale-dominated turbulence regardless of external forcing.</description>

      <title>Wilson-Fisher renormalization of discrete gravity-capillary wave turbulence in viscous fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental realization of Wilson-Fisher renormalization in driven surface-wave turbulence across Newtonian fluids spanning nearly six decades in Raynolds number. Discrete capillary and gravity turbulence define two universality classes selected by interaction topology: triadic resonances for capillary waves and effectively tetradic scattering for gravity waves. Navier-Stokes viscosity is the relevant perturbation that renormalizes spectral transfer and terminates the cascade. The resulting framework predicts the Kolmogorov cutoff from the balance of nonlinear transfer and viscous damping, and Reynolds scaling of the integrated inertial spectral weight. Laser Doppler Vibrometry quantitatively confirms these renormalized scaling laws, establishing discrete gravity-capillary turbulence as a tunable laboratory for nonequilibrium crossoever criticality.</description>

      <title>Submesoscale and boundary layer turbulence under mesoscale forcing in the upper ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction among quasi-geostrophic mesoscale eddies, submesoscale fronts, and boundary layer turbulence (BLT) is a central problem in upper ocean dynamics. We investigate these multiscale dynamics using a novel large-eddy simulation on a 100km-scale domain with meter-scale resolution. The simulation resolves BLT energized by uniform surface wind and convective forcing. A front interacts with BLT within a prescribed, spatially inhomogeneous mesoscale eddy field, representing a canonical eddy quadrupole. Using a triple flow decomposition, we analyze the dynamic coupling and kinetic energy budgets among the large-scale field, submesoscale field, and the resolved BLT. Our analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in the structure and intensity of submesoscales and BLT under varying mesoscale forcing. Turbulent kinetic energy and production rates can vary by an order of magnitude along the front, creating distinct turbulent hotspots whose locations are tied to the underlying large-scale flow. The region under stronger mesoscale convergence holds stronger horizontal and vertical geostrophic shear productions for BLT, and stronger self-production and BLT-destruction for submesoscales. In contrast, the region under dominant mesoscale divergence holds dramatic distortion of the front isotherm, along with dominant submesoscale vertical buoyancy production and self-destruction. These results provide a direct characterization of BLT and submesoscales in the ocean mixed layer modulated by a mesoscale eddy field, which can better inform future parameterization developments.</description>

      <title>Boundary treatment algorithms for meshfree RANS turbulence modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose improved wall-treatment strategies for meshfree methods applied to turbulent flows. The goal is to improve wall-function handling in simulations of high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows, and to better understand the performance of turbulence models when used with meshfree methods. While wall-function techniques are well established for mesh-based methods, their inclusion in meshfree methods faces unique challenges that have not been fully explored. The main difficulties arise from the lack of connectivity between points and from point movement in Lagrangian frameworks, which can complicate consistent wall treatment. To address these issues, we explore three wall-treatment techniques. We highlight the drawbacks of the standard closest neighbor approach. We then introduce two novel approaches: the nearest-band neighbor method and the shifted boundary method. We evaluate these methods using first-order turbulence closures: Spalart--Allmaras, $k-\varepsilon$, and $k-\omega$. These methods are tested numerically on 1D Couette flow, turbulent flow over a flat plate, and flow around a NACA 0012 airfoil in 3D. The results show that both novel methods outperform the closest neighbor approach. The shifted boundary method achieves higher accuracy, but is more computationally expensive than the nearest-band neighbor method. However, by using smaller shift distances, we can achieve lower $y^+$ values with the same resolution. All turbulence models work well with the shifted boundary method, with only minor differences between them. In contrast, the nearest-band method shows variation in the behavior of the turbulence models, where the Spalart--Allmaras model yields better results, especially further downstream along the plate. This work establishes a robust foundation for simulating wall-bounded turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers using meshfree collocation methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of the rotating shallow water model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotating shallow water equations (RSWE) are a mainstay of atmospheric and oceanic modeling, and their wave dynamics has close analogues in settings ranging from two-dimensional electron gases to active-matter fluids. While recent work has emphasized the topological character of RSWE wave bands, here we develop a complementary quantum-geometric description by computing the full quantum geometric tensor (QGT) for the linearized RSWE on an $f$-plane. The QGT unifies two pieces of band geometry: its real part defines a metric that quantifies how rapidly wave polarization changes with parameters, while its imaginary part is the Berry curvature that controls geometric phases and topological invariants. We obtain compact, symmetry-guided expressions for all three bands, highlighting the transverse structure of the metric and the monopole-like Berry curvature that yields Chern numbers for the Poincar\'e bands. Finally, we describe a feasible route to probing this geometry in rotating-tank experiments via weak, time-periodic parametric driving.</description>

      <title>Computing Statistical Properties of Velocity Fields on Current Quantum Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are gaining attention in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their favorable scaling, as encoding physical fields into quantum probability amplitudes enables representation of two to the power of n spatial points with only n qubits. A key challenge in Quantum CFD is the efficient readout of simulation results, a topic that has received limited attention in literature. This work presents methods to extract statistical properties of spatial velocity fields, such as central moments and structure functions, directly from parameterized ansatz circuits, avoiding full quantum state tomography. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach for 1D velocity fields, encoding 16 spatial points with 4 qubits, and analyze both a sine wave signal and four snapshots from Burgers' equation evolution. Using Qedma's error mitigation software QESEM, we demonstrate that such computations achieve high accuracy on current quantum devices, specifically IBMQ's Heron2 system ibm_fez.</description>

      <title>Capillary Slinky: Equilibrium and Dynamics of Droplets in a Soft Spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Springs can be found in many applications and biological systems, and when these are soft, they easily deform. At small scales, capillarity can induce a force leading to spring deformations when the elastocapillary number is small. We demonstrate through experiments the non-trivial equilibrium shape liquid droplets adopt in these soft springs, which form an annulus, Eruciform, and spherical shapes. When these droplets are set in motion, they display different flow regimes with significant dissipation generated by the internal rotational flow. The static and dynamics of droplets in such a capillary slinky is also used to demonstrate how surface tension can actuate springs by stretching/compression, while providing a way for active flow control in soft springs.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced plasma formation and cavitation in water: from nanoeffects to extreme states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of the energy dependence of optical breakdown in water by tightly focused laser pulses, from plasma formation to shock waves and cavitation. Laser pulses of fs to ns durations and UV to IR wavelengths are aberration-free focused through microscope objectives. Photography captures luminescent plasmas with submicrometer resolution, and bubble threshold and size are determined via probe beam scattering. The energy dependence of mechanical effects is quantified through the maximum bubble radius Rmax. We find three key scenarios depicting the interaction between multiphoton and avalanche ionization, recombination, and thermal ionization from nanoeffects near threshold to extreme energy densities. They include a previously unknown scenario that emerges with single-longitudinal-mode UV ns pulses from compact lasers. It enables cost-effective creation of nanoeffects, as demonstrated on corneal tissue and glass. High-resolution photography reveals new insights in the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasma formation, with an interplay of breakdown waves, string formation by local instabilities of avalanche ionization, and radiative energy transport. Plasma volume data from photographs together with absorption measurements show that the average energy density of luminescent fs and ns plasmas is similar, ranging between 10 and 40 kJ/cm^3 . However, small hot regions with up to 400 kJ/cm^3 are formed in ns breakdown. From the hot regions, energy is spread out via X-ray bremsstrahlung, forming a luminescent halo. Well above threshold, Rmax scales with E^(1/3) across all scenarios, with 15% - 20% conversion of laser energy into bubble energy. With increasing plasma energy density, an ever-larger energy fraction is converted into shock wave energy (75% at 40 kJ/cm^3 ). The results provide guidelines for parameter selection in laser surgery and material processing.</description>

      <title>Evidence on the incompatibility of smoothed particle hydrodynamics and eddy viscosity models for large eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we will present evidence for the incompatibility of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods and eddy viscosity models. Taking a coarse-graining perspective, we physically argue that SPH methods operate intrinsically as Lagrangian Large Eddy Simulations (LES) for turbulent flows with strongly overlapping discretization elements. However, these overlapping elements in combination with numerical errors cause a significant amount of implicit subfilter stresses (SFS). Considering a Taylor-Green flow at $Re=10^4$, the SFS will be shown to be relevant where turbulent fluctuations are created, explaining why turbulent flows are challenging even for current SPH methods. Although one might hope to mitigate the implicit SFS using eddy viscosity models, we show a degradation of the turbulent transition process, which is rooted in the non-locality of these methods.</description>

      <title>Slip over liquid-infused gratings in the singular limit of a nearly inviscid lubricant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider shear-driven longitudinal flow of an exterior fluid over a periodic array of rectangular grooves filled with an immiscible interior fluid (the "lubricant"), the grooves being formed by infinitely thin ridges protruding from a flat substrate. The ratio $\lambda$ of the effective slip length to the semi-period is a function of the ratio $\mu$ of the interior to exterior viscosities and the ratio $h$ of the grooves depth to the semi-period. We focus on the limit $\mu\ll1$, which is singular for that geometry. We find that the viscous resistance to the imposed shear is dominated by a boundary layer of exponentially small extent about the ridge tips, resulting in the effective slip length scaling as $\mu^{-1/2}$ - not $\mu^{-1}$ as implied by intuitive arguments overlooking the tip contributions (and by proposed approximations in the literature). Analyzing that exponential region in conjunction with an integral force balance, we find the simple asymptotic approximation $\lambda\approx \mu^{-1/2}$; using conformal mappings, we also calculate the leading-order correction to that result, which introduces a dependence upon $h$. The ensuing asymptotic expansion breaks down for $h=O(\mu^{1/2})$, upon transitioning to a lubrication geometry. We accordingly conduct a companion asymptotic analysis in the distinguished limit of small $\mu$ and fixed $H=h/\mu^{1/2}$, which gives $\lambda\approx \mu^{-1/2}H/(1+H)$ as well as a closed-form leading-order correction to that approximation; the intuitive $\mu^{-1}$ scaling is accordingly only relevant to the regime $H\ll1$ corresponding to extremely shallow grooves. We demonstrate excellent agreement between our predictions and numerical solutions constructed using a boundary-integral formulation.</description>

Abstract: A coupled system composed of a Newtonian fluid located on a sinusoidally-forced elastic solid is studied analytically and numerically. The focus is on the transient evolution from the beginning of the forced oscillations and on the periodic behaviour established once the transient has vanished. The analytical solution is expressed as series summations that elucidate the propagation and reflections of elastic transverse waves through the solid layer and the viscous dissipation of oscillations in the fluid layer. Short-term transients in both the fluid and the solid form at every interaction between an elastic wave and a solid boundary. The long-term transient, quantified by the power balance in the fluid layer, instead pertains to the formation of all the elastic waves in the solid layer. The system can be viewed as a generalised transient Stokes layer generated by the elastic waves or as a damped resonant oscillator when the velocity at the fluid-solid interface increases significantly with respect to the forcing amplitude. A parametric study is carried out for three applications of technological interest, i.e. the indirect measurement of fluid viscosity, the turbulent drag reduction by travelling shear waves and the sensing and manipulation of biological flows.</description>

      <title>Computational study of airfoil stall flutter Limit Cycle Oscillations</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive numerical investigation of a NACA0012 undergoing Stall Flutter Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCO) across distinct fluid dynamics regimes. It accurately models Small Amplitude Oscillations (SAO) in the transitional Reynolds regime and Large Amplitude Oscillations (LAO) in the moderate regime, observed in different experimental campaigns. The SAO analysis serves as a verification of the computational framework against established numerical benchmarks. Crucially, the LAO simulations represent the first documented prediction across the full experimental velocity range correlated against available measured data, addressing a significant literature gap. The predictions fidelity relies on rigorous computational criteria defined through a detailed sensitivity analysis. This demonstrated numerical requirements significantly more demanding than those typically employed for computing static polars or simulating dynamic pitching motion of rigid airfoils, underscoring the severity of the aeroelastic problem. Quantitatively the simulation systematically over-predicts the critical onset velocity and under-predicts the LCO amplitudes.However, the results show strong qualitative agreement with experimental observations, successfully reproducing key dynamic stall mechanics and bifurcation phenomena.</description>

      <title>VICON: Vision In-Context Operator Networks for Multi-Physics Fluid Dynamics Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16063v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) have demonstrated the ability to learn operators across diverse partial differential equations using few-shot, in-context learning. However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications. Our scripts for processing datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Eydcao/VICON.</description>
