      <title>Kinematics of ultrarelativistic electrons in periodic fields of moderate strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright sources of hard x- and gamma-ray electromagnetic radiation are of high demand in physics and technology. Such sources, e.g., x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), undulator- or Compton-based sources of polarized positrons, etc., require intense ultrarelativivstic electron beams with small energy spread. Also each electron should emit many photons of almost identical spectra per pass through the periodic field of undulator or laser pulse. We develop a kinematic model based on the energy-momentum conservation law and the corpuscular presentation of the periodic-field photons. The model incorporates the mass shift effect in periodic fields. We made an assumption of equality of the average number of photons, which induce the mass shift, to the Poisson parameter of the coherent field. The model allows to evaluate the evolution of the spectrum of electron bunch passing through the periodic fields of undulators or laser pulses. We propose a method of undulator fine tuning aimed at maximization of the spectral brightness.</description>

      <title>AC Loss Computation in Large-Scale Low-Temperature Superconducting Magnets: Multi-Scale and Semi-Analytical Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two complementary approaches for the accurate prediction of AC losses in large-scale low-temperature superconducting (LTS) magnets. These methods account for the temperature rise within the LTS coil and its impact on AC losses. The first approach is multi-scale and relies on the coupling between a macroscopic homogenized model of the LTS coil and a mesoscopic model of a single conductor for loss prediction. The second approach is semi-analytical and is based on analytical approximations for the hysteresis losses, which are validated against a single filament model. The second approach offers a faster computation suitable for initial design considerations, while the multi-scale method is shown to provide more accurate results. We apply both methods to the prediction of AC losses generated in the LTS coil inside the IBA S2C2 synchrocyclotron during its ramp-up procedure. Additionally, we discuss the convergence properties of the multi-scale approach and demonstrate the good agreement between the numerical results and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Intense X-ray Vortices Generation via Wavefront Shaping in high-gain Free-Electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The x-ray vortex optical beam, distinguished by its topological charge and orbital angular momentum, offers new insights in probing complex electronic structures, enhancing material characterization, and advancing high-resolution imaging techniques. Here we propose a straightforward and effective method to generate intense x-ray vortices with tunable wavelengths in high-gain free-electron lasers (FELs). By simply adjusting the wavefront tilt of the radiation pulse during the FEL gain process, high-quality vortex beam can be amplified until saturation. Compared to existing methods for FEL vortex generation, the proposed technique imposes no wavelength limitations and can be easily implemented in high-gain FEL facilities, regardless of the operation modes.</description>
