      <title>Cech - de Rham Chern character on the stack of holomorphic vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a formula for the Chern character of a holomorphic vector bundle in the hyper-cohomology of the de Rham complex of holomorphic sheaves on a complex manifold. This Chern character can be thought of as a completion of the Chern character in Hodge cohomology obtained as the trace of the exponential of the Atiyah class, which is \v{C}ech closed, to one that is \v{C}ech-Del closed. Such a completion is a key step toward lifting O'Brian-Toledo-Tong invariants of coherent sheaves from Hodge cohomology to de Rham cohomology. An alternate approach toward the same end goal, instead using simplicial differential forms and Green complexes, can be found in Hosgood's works [Ho1, Ho2]. In the algebraic setting, and more generally for K\"{a}hler manifolds, where Hodge and de Rham cohomologies agree, such extensions are not necessary, whereas in the non-K\"{a}hler, or equivariant settings the two theories differ. We provide our formulae as a map of simplicial presheaves, which readily extend the results to the equivariant setting and beyond. This paper can be viewed as a sequel to [GMTZ1] which covered such a discussion in Hodge cohomology. As an aside, we give a conceptual understanding of how formulas obtained by Bott and Tu for Chern classes using transition functions and those from Chern-Weil theory using connections, are part of a natural unifying story.</description>

      <title>Toda-type presentations for the quantum K theory of partial flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a determinantal, Toda-type, presentation for the equivariant K theory of a partial flag variety $\mathrm{Fl}(r_1, \ldots, r_k;n)$. The proof relies on pushing forward the Toda presentation obtained by Maeno, Naito and Sagaki for the complete flag variety $\mathrm{Fl}(n)$, via Kato's $\mathrm{K}_T(\mathrm{pt})$-algebra homomorphism from the quantum K ring of $\mathrm{Fl}(n)$ to that of $\mathrm{Fl}(r_1, \ldots, r_k;n)$. Starting instead from the Whitney presentation for $\mathrm{Fl}(n)$, we show that the same push-forward technique gives a recursive formula for polynomial representatives of quantum K Schubert classes in any partial flag variety which do not depend on quantum parameters. In an appendix, we include another proof of the Toda presentation for the equivariant quantum K ring of $\mathrm{Fl}(n)$, following Anderson, Chen, and Tseng, which is based on the fact that the $\mathrm{K}$ theoretic $J$-function is an eigenfunction of the finite difference Toda Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>On the Cox rings of some hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a cohomological method to compute Cox rings of hypersurfaces in the ambient space P^1 x P^n, which is more direct than existing methods. We prove that smooth hypersurfaces defined by regular sequences of coefficients are Mori dream spaces, generalizing a result of Ottem. We also compute Cox rings of certain specialized examples. In particular, we compute Cox rings in the well-studied family of Calabi--Yau threefolds of bidegree (2,4) in P^1 x P^3, determining explicitly how the Cox ring can jump discontinuously in a smooth family.</description>

      <title>Hermite Reciprocity and Self-Duality of Generalized Eagon-Northcott Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous examples of self-duality for generalized Eagon-Northcott complexes were given by computing the divisor class group for Hankel determinantal rings. We prove a new case of self-duality of generalized Eagon-Northcott complexes with input being a map defining a Koszul module with nice properties. This choice of Koszul module can be specialized to the Weyman module, which was used in a proof of the generic version of Green's conjecture. In this case, the proof uses a version of Hermite Reciprocity not previously defined in the literature.</description>

      <title>Canonical forms of polytopes from adjoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projectivizations of pointed polyhedral cones $C$ are positive geometries in the sense of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, and Lam. Their canonical forms look like $$ \Omega_C(x)=\frac{A(x)}{B(x)} dx, $$ with $A,B$ polynomials. The denominator $B(x)$ is just the product of the linear equations defining the facets of $C$. We will see that the numerator $A(x)$ is given by the adjoint polynomial of the dual cone $C^{\vee}$. The adjoint was originally defined by Warren, who used it to construct barycentric coordinates in general polytopes. Confirming the intuition that the job of the numerator is to cancel unwanted poles outside the polytope, we will see that the adjoint is the unique polynomial of minimal degree whose hypersurface contains the residual arrangement of non-face intersections of supporting hyperplanes of $C$.</description>

Abstract: In one of our previous articles, we outlined the formulation of a version of the categorical arithmetic local Langlands conjecture. The aims of this article are threefold. First, we provide a detailed account of one component of this conjecture: the local Langlands category. Second, we aim to prove this conjecture in the tame case for quasi-split unramified reductive groups. Finally, we will explore the first applications of such categorical equivalence.</description>

      <title>Additive diameters of group representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the concept of additive diameters in the context of group representations, unifying various noncommutative Waring-type problems. Given a finite-dimensional representation $\rho \colon G \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ and a subspace $U \leq V$ that generates $V$ as a $G$-module, we define the $G$-additive diameter of $V$ with respect to $U$ as the minimal number of translates of $U$ under the representation $\rho$ needed to cover $V$. We demonstrate that every irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbf{C})$ exhibits optimal additive diameters and establish sharp bounds for the conjugation representation of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{C})$ on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbf{C})$. Additionally, we investigate analogous notions for additive diameters in Lie representations. We provide applications to additive diameters with respect to images of equivariant algebraic morphisms, linking them to the corresponding $G$-additive diameters of images of their differentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate equivariant recollements of abelian (resp. triangulated) categories. We first characterize when a recollement of abelian (resp. triangulated) categories induces an equivariant recollement, i.e. a recollement between the corresponding equivariant abelian (resp. triangulated) categories. We further investigate singular equivalences in the context of equivariant abelian recollements. In particular, we characterize when a singular equivalence induced by the quotient functor in an abelian recollement lift to a singular equivalence induced by the equivariant quotient functor. As applications of our results: (i) we construct equivariant recollements for the derived category of a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme where the action is coming from a subgroup of the automorphism group of the scheme and (ii) we derive new singular equivalences between certain skew group algebras.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Approach to Hyperbolic Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic quantum error correction codes (HQECCs) leverage the unique geometric properties of hyperbolic space to enhance the capabilities and performance of quantum error correction. By embedding qubits in hyperbolic lattices, HQECCs achieve higher encoding rates and improved error thresholds compared to conventional Euclidean codes. Building on recent advances in hyperbolic crystallography, we present a systematic framework for constructing HQECCs. As a key component of this framework, we develop a novel algorithm for computing all plaquette cycles and logical operators associated with a given HQECC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we utilize this framework to simulate two HQECCs based respectively on two relevant examples of hyperbolic tilings. In the process, we evaluate key code parameters such as encoding rate, error threshold, and code distance for different sub-lattices. This work establishes a solid foundation for a systematic and comprehensive analysis of HQECCs, paving the way for the practical implementation of HQECCs in the pursuit of robust quantum error correction strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a sequel to our previous article arXiv:2307.07897. We describe a certain reduction process of Satake's good basic invariants. We show that if the largest degree $d_1$ of a finite complex reflection group $G$ is regular and if $\delta$ is a divisor of $d_1$, a set of good basic invariants of $G$ induces that of the reflection subquotient $G_{\delta}$. We also show that the potential vector field of a duality group $G$, which gives the multiplication constants of the natural Saito structure on the orbit space, induces that of $G_{\delta}$. Several examples of this reduction process are also presented.</description>

Abstract: Our study concerns the Euclidean distance function in case of complex plane curves. We decompose the ED discriminant into 3 parts which are responsible for the 3 types of behavior of the Morse points, and we find the structure of each one. In particular we shed light on the ``atypical discriminant'' which is due to the loss of Morse points at infinity. We find formulas for the number of Morse singularities which abut to the corresponding 3 types of attractors when moving the centre of the distance function toward a point of the discriminant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double ramification loci parametrise marked curves where a weighted sum of the markings is linearly trivial; higher rank loci are obtained by imposing several such conditions simultaneously. We obtain closed formulae for the orbifold Euler characteristics of double ramification loci, and their higher rank generalisations, in genus one. The rank one formula is a polynomial, while the higher rank formula involves greatest common divisors of matrix minors. The proof is based on a recurrence relation, which allows for induction on the rank and number of markings.</description>

Abstract: For a family of log points with constant log structure and for a proper SNCL scheme with an SNCD over the family, we construct a fundamental l-adic bifiltered complex as a geometric application of the theory of the derived category of (bi)filtered complexes in our papers. By using this bifiltered complex, we give the formulation of the log l-adic relative monodromy-weight conjecture with respect to the filtration arising from the SNCD. That is, we state that the relative l-adic monodromy filtration should exist for the Kummer log etale cohomological sheaf of the proper SNCL scheme with an SNCD and it should be equal to the l-adic weight filtration.</description>

      <title>On the configurations of four spheres supporting the vertices of a tetrahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reformulation of the three circles theorem of Johnson with distance coordinates to the vertices of a triangle is explicitly represented in a polynomial system and solved by symbolic computation. A similar polynomial system in distance coordinates to the vertices of a tetrahedron $T \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is introduced to represent the configurations of four spheres of radius $R^*$, which intersect in one point, each sphere containing three vertices of $T$ but not the fourth one. This problem is related to that of computing the largest value $R$ for which the set of vertices of $T$ is an $R$-body. For triangular pyramids we completely describe the set of geometric configurations with the required four balls of radius $R^*$. The solutions obtained by symbolic computation show that triangular pyramids are splitted into two different classes: in the first one $R^*$ is unique, in the second one three values $R^*$ there exist. The first class can be itself subdivided into two subclasses, one of which is related to the family of $R$-bodies.</description>

Abstract: We give a universal property of the construction of the ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors of a commutative ring, endowed with Witt vectors Frobenius and Verschiebung, and generalize this construction to the derived setting. We define an $\infty$-category of $p$-typical derived $\delta$-Cartier rings and show that the derived ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors of a derived ring is naturally an object in this $\infty$-category. Moreover, we show that for any prime $p$, the formation of the derived ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors gives an equivalence between the $\infty$-category of all derived rings and the full subcategory of all derived $p$-typical $\delta$-Cartier rings consisting of $V$-complete objects.</description>
