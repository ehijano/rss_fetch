      <title>Initial Analysis of Ionospheric Electron Density Variations Across Ecuador Using GPS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we performed a preliminary mapping of Total Electron Content (TEC) over Ecuador using Global Positioning System (GPS) data. This process entails collecting and analyzing pseudorange observations from multiple GPS receivers nationwide. These receivers record signals from GPS satellites, and by comparing the arrival times of these signals, the number of electrons in the ionosphere can be inferred along the lines of sight between the satellites and the receivers.
  To perform this process, signal processing algorithms are utilized to calculate TEC values, which are subsequently used to generate two-dimensional color maps that illustrate the spatial distribution of TEC in Ecuador. These maps, created using data from 13 GPS receivers distributed throughout the country, offer a valuable visualization of TEC variability regarding geographic location and time. Focusing on specific days in January 2022, this study aims to analyze patterns and trends in ionospheric electron content across the region.
  The results revealed an oscillatory pattern in TEC evolution, with intensity peaks sometimes reaching or exceeding 80 TEC units (TECU), while local minima never reach zero values. This preliminary TEC mapping approach over Ecuador using GPS data is crucial for understanding ionospheric dynamics in the region. It may have various applications, including improving the accuracy of GPS navigation, monitoring solar activity, and forecasting ionospheric phenomena that can impact communications and satellite navigation.</description>

      <title>Estimating solar radiation environment extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme Solar Energetic Particle Events (ESPEs) were identified almost a decade ago, providing context for super events unleashed by our host star, the Sun. Their assumed solar origin drives the question of their ``worst-case" impact, which could be profound, multifaceted, and devastating for our technological society. A methodology that directly relates the soft X-ray flux $F_{SXR}$ of the driving solar flare of a Solar Energetic Particle event to its ``worst-case" integral fluence spectrum has recently been proposed by Papaioannou et al. (2023). We employ this method to the ESPEs that have been confirmed in cosmogenic radionuclide records up to date, retrieve their ``worst-case" integral spectrum, and compare the latter to the actual -- independently obtained -- recent reconstructions based on the radionuclide records. We first show that our method allows us to estimate the integral fluence spectra of one of the paleo events, i.e., AD774/775, one of the strongest ESPEs found within the cosmogenic radionuclide records so far. We then implement a mean ESPE utilizing four confirmed paleo ESPEs (i.e., AD993/994, AD774/775, 660 BCE, and 7176 BCE) and test the resulting spectrum against the estimated one. Finally, we test the same methodology for a series of strong SEPs recorded on the Earth's surface as Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs). In all investigated cases, the recent re-calibration of $F_{SXR}$ by Hudson et al. (2024) is considered. We conclude that the methodology can adequately estimate the ``worst-case" integral fluence spectra for both strong and extreme SEP events, quantifying their impact up to an integral energy of $\sim$ E $&gt;$ 1 GeV.</description>

      <title>An assessment of observational coverage and gaps for robust Sun to heliosphere integrated science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the generation and development of the continuous outflow from the Sun requires tracing the physical conditions from deep in the corona to the heliosphere. Detailed global observations of plasma state variables and the magnetic field are needed to provide critical constraints to the underlying physics driving models of the corona and solar wind. Key diagnostics of the solar wind require measurements at its formation site and during its outflow to continuously track it across rapidly changing regions of space. A unified view of the solar wind is only possible through coordinated remote and in situ observations that probe these different regions. Here, we discuss current observational coverage and gaps of different plasma properties and review recent coordinated studies. We highlight how these efforts may become more routine with the launch of upcoming and planned missions.</description>

      <title>On the reason for the widespread energetic storm particle event of 13 March 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 13 March 2023, when the Parker Solar Probe was situated on the far side of the Sun as seen from Earth, a large solar eruption took place creating a strong solar energetic particle (SEP) event observed by multiple spacecraft (S/C). The energetic event was observed at six well-separated locations: Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, STEREO~A, near-Earth S/C, and MAVEN. An in-situ shock crossing and a related energetic storm particle (ESP) event were observed at all inner-heliospheric S/C, suggesting that the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock extended all around the Sun. However, the solar event was accompanied by a series of pre-event CMEs. We aim to characterize this extreme widespread SEP event and to provide an explanation for the unusual observation of a circumsolar interplanetary shock and corresponding circumsolar ESP event. We analyse data from seven space missions to characterize the solar eruption at the Sun, the energetic particle event, and the interplanetary context at each observer location as well as the magnetic connectivity of each observer to the Sun. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar wind in which we inject various CMEs that were launched before as well as contemporaneously with the solar eruption under study. In particular, we test two different scenarios that could have produced the observed global ESP event: 1) a single circumsolar blast-wave-like shock launched by the associated solar eruption, and 2) the combination of multiple CMEs driving shocks into different directions. By comparing the simulations of the two scenarios with observations we find that both settings are able to explain the observations. However, the blast-wave scenario performs slightly better in terms of the predicted shock arrival times at the various observers.</description>

      <title>Developing a Linear Fluid Plasma Model with Accurate Kinetic Bernstein Waves: A First Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic models provide highly accurate descriptions of plasma waves but involve complex integrals that are computationally expensive to solve. To facilitate a fluid-like treatment of the system, we propose rational approximations for both the plasma dispersion function in the parallel integral and the Bessel function in the perpendicular integral, ensuring that the system remains rational with respect to all three variables: wave frequency $\omega$, parallel wavevector $k_\parallel$, and perpendicular wavevector $k_\perp$. By accurately approximating the Bessel function over a wide range of Larmor radius $\rho_{cs}$ values, from $k_\perp\rho_{cs} \to 0$ to $k_\perp\rho_{cs} \to \infty$, we present an initial attempt to incorporate kinetic Bernstein waves into a fluid model. As an application, we employ this model to analyze wave propagation conditions (i.e., accessibility) by solving for the complex perpendicular wavevector $k_\perp$ using a matrix eigenvalue method with given input parameters. This work may contribute to studies of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) and ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) heating in magnetized confinement plasmas.</description>

      <title>Emergence of two inertial sub-ranges in solar wind turbulence: dependence on heliospheric distance and solar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03090</link>

Abstract: The solar wind is highly turbulent, and intermittency effects are observed for fluctuations within the inertial range. By analyzing magnetic field spectra and fourth-order moments, we perform a comparative study of turbulence and intermittency in different types of solar wind measured during periods of solar minima and a maximum. Using eight fast solar wind intervals measured during solar minima between 0.3 au and 3.16 au, we found a clear signature of two inertial sub-ranges with $f^{-3/2}$ and $f^{-5/3}$ power laws in the magnetic power spectra. The intermittency, measured through the scaling law of the kurtosis of magnetic field fluctuations, further confirms the existence of two different power laws separated by a clear break. A systematic study on the evolution of the said sub-ranges as a function of heliospheric distance shows correlation of the break scale with both the turbulence outer scale and the typical ion scales. During solar maximum, on the contrary, the two sub-ranges are not omnipresent, thus showing more variability in the power spectra and intermittency scaling properties.</description>

      <title>Efficient magnetohydrodynamic modelling of the time-evolving corona by COCONUT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared to quasi-steady-state corona models that are constrained by a time-invariant magnetogram over a CR period, time-evolving corona models driven by time-varying photospheric magnetograms are more realistic and can maintain more useful information to accurately describe solar wind evolution and forecast CME propagation. This paper demonstrate that time-evolving corona simulations can be performed efficiently and accurately using an implicit method with relatively large time steps. We also evaluate differences between coronal structures captured by time-evolving and quasi-steady simulations over a CR period during solar minimum. We used a series of hourly updated photospheric magnetograms to drive the evolution of coronal structures from the solar surface to $25\; R_s$ during two CRs around the 2019 eclipse in an inertial coordinate system. We compare the time-evolving and quasi-steady simulations to demonstrate that the differences in these two types of coronal modelling can be obvious even for a solar minimum. The relative differences in radial velocity and density can be over $15 \%$ and $25 \%$ at 20$\;R_s$ during one CR period. We also evaluated the impact of time steps on the simulation results. Using a time step of approximately 10 minutes balances efficiency and necessary numerical stability and accuracy for time-evolving corona simulations around solar minima, with coronal evolution during a full CR simulated within only 9 hours (using 1080 CPU cores for 1.5M grid cells). The simulation results demonstrate that time-evolving MHD coronal simulations can be performed efficiently and accurately using an implicit method, offering a more realistic alternative to quasi-steady-state simulations. The fully implicit time-evolving corona model thus promises to simulate the time-evolving corona accurately in practical space weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Cross Helicity and the Helium Abundance as an in situ Metric of Solar Wind Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-state solar wind paradigm is based on observations showing that slow and fast solar wind have distinct properties like helium abundances, kinetic signatures, elemental composition, and charge-state ratios. Nominally, the fast wind originates from solar sources that are continuously magnetically open to the heliosphere like coronal holes while the slow wind is from solar sources that are only intermittently open to the heliosphere like helmet streamers and pseudostreamers. The Alfv\'enic slow wind is an emerging 3rd class of solar wind that challenges the two-state fast/slow paradigm. It has slow wind speeds but is highly Alfv\'enic, i.e. has a high correlation between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations along with low compressibility typical of Alfv\'en waves, which is typically observed in fast wind. Its other properties are also more similar to the fast than slow wind. From 28 years of Wind observations at 1 AU, we derive the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\mathrm{He}$), Alfv\'enicity ($\left|\sigma_c\right|$), and solar wind speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$). Characterizing vsw as a function of $\left|\sigma_c\right|$ and $A_\mathrm{He}$, we show that the maximum solar wind speed for plasma accelerated in source regions that are intermittently open is faster than the minimum solar wind speed for plasma accelerated in continuously open regions. We infer that the Alfv\'enic slow wind is likely solar wind originating from open-field regions with speeds below the maximum solar wind speed for plasma from intermittently open regions. We then discuss possible implications for solar wind acceleration. Finally, we utilize the combination of helium abundance and normalized cross helicity to present a novel solar wind categorization scheme that illustrates the transition in observations of solar wind at 1 AU from magnetically closed to magnetically open sources.</description>
