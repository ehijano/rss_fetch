      <title>Multi-iron subpopulations in Liller 1 from high resolution H-band spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high resolution chemical study of a representative sample of 21 luminous giant stars of Liller~1, a complex stellar system in the Galactic bulge, based on H band spectra acquired with the Near InfraRed Spectrograph at KeckII. 15 stars turn out to have a subsolar iron abundance and enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Al/Fe], likely old that formed early and quickly from gas mainly enriched by type~II supernovae, and 6 stars with supersolar iron and roughly solar-scaled [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Al/Fe], likely younger, thus formed at later epochs from gas also enriched by type~Ia supernovae. Moreover, both subpopulations show enhanced [N/Fe], as in the bulge field, about solar-scaled [V/Fe], and depletion of [C/Fe] and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C with respect to the solar values, indicating the occurrence of significant mixing in the stellar interiors of these evolved stars. The current study has also made evident that the sub-solar subpopulation shows some structuring, and the presence of a third subcomponent with iron content and [$\alpha$/Fe] enhancement somewhat intermediate between the metal-poor and metal-rich main subpopulations, has been statistically assessed, providing the chemical signature of an extended star formation with multiple bursts and of some self-enrichment.</description>

      <title>A candidate dark matter deficient dwarf galaxy in the Fornax cluster identified through overluminous star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxies were identified recently as having little or no dark matter (DM), provoking widespread interest in their formation histories. These galaxies also host populous systems of star clusters that are on average larger and more luminous than typical globular clusters (GCs). We report an initial attempt to identify new candidate DM-deficient dwarfs via their unusual GC systems. Using a large catalog of LSB galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey, we inspect their Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) imaging and identify FCC 224 as a candidate found on the outskirts of the Fornax cluster. We analyze the GC system using DECaLS and archival Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 imaging, and find an apparent population of overluminous GCs. More detailed follow-up of FCC 224 is in progress.</description>

      <title>NEXUS: the North ecliptic pole EXtragalactic Unified Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NEXUS is a JWST Multi-Cycle (Cycles 3-5; 368 primary hrs) GO Treasury imaging and spectroscopic survey around the North Ecliptic Pole. It contains two overlapping tiers. The Wide tier ($\sim 400~{\rm arcmin}^2$) performs NIRCam/WFSS 2.4-5 micron grism spectroscopy with three epochs over 3 years (final continuum ${\rm S/N/pixel&gt;3}$ at F444W$&lt;22.2$). The Deep tier ($\sim 50~{\rm arcmin}^2$) performs high-multiplexing NIRSpec 0.6-5.3 micron MOS/PRISM spectroscopy for $\sim 10,000$ targets, over 18 epochs with a 2-month cadence (epoch/final continuum ${\rm S/N/pixel&gt;3}$ at F200W$\lesssim 27/29$). All epochs have simultaneous multi-band NIRCam and MIRI imaging ($5\sigma$ final depths of $\sim 28-29$ in NIRCam and $\sim 25$ in MIRI). The field is within the continuous viewing zone of JWST, and is fully covered by the Euclid Ultra-Deep Field, with 0.9-2 micron deep Euclid spectroscopy and cadenced photometry. NEXUS has three science pillars. First, with its massive and nearly complete (flux-limited) spectroscopic samples and deep photometry, it will perform efficient classification and physical characterization of galaxies and AGNs from $z\sim 1$ to Cosmic Dawn. With the large contiguous area coverage, it will measure the spatial clustering and demography of the first galaxies and SMBHs at $z&gt;6$. Second, multi-epoch observations enable systematic time-domain investigations, focusing on $z&gt;3$ transients and low-mass AGN reverberation mapping. Third, the comprehensive data set will enable knowledge transfer to other legacy fields, create data challenges, and initiate benchmark work for future space missions. With rapid public releases of processed data and an open invitation for collaboration, NEXUS aims for broad and swift community engagement, to become a powerhouse to drive transformative advancements in multiple key science areas of astronomy.</description>

      <title>Comparing Gaia, NED and SIMBAD source classifications in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) provides the first classifications for the sources in Gaia's all-sky database. Most Gaia sources are stars in the Milky Way, but DR3 also contains many sources that belong to nearby galaxies, as well as background galaxies and quasars. In this work, we compare the Gaia classifications from the Discrete Source Classifier (CU8-DSC) module to the more detailed and heterogeneous classifications in NED and/or SIMBAD for sources with sky positions within twice the Holmberg radius of nearby galaxies. Matching these catalogues gives approximately 3.2e5 unique Gaia matches for 4e5 sources over 1040 galaxies (excluding some large Local Group galaxies) in the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue. Matched sources contain a lower fraction of Gaia-classified stars and higher fractions of galaxies and quasars (~95, 2 and 2 per cent, respectively) than DR3 overall. Considering NED (SIMBAD) classifications as truth values, the balanced accuracy of Gaia classification is 0.80 (0.83): the most common disagreements are literature-classified galaxies Gaia-classified as stars and literature-classified stars Gaia-classified as quasars. Purity (P) and completeness (C) metrics show that agreement between Gaia classification and NED/SIMBAD classification is best for stars (P,C~0.9), and decreases for quasars (P&lt;0.3, 0.7&lt;C&lt;0.8), galaxies (0.7&lt;P&lt;0.8, 0.3&lt;C&lt;0.6), white dwarfs (0.04&lt;P&lt;0.6, C~0.6), and binary stars (P,C&lt;0.1). NED or SIMBAD sources classified only by detection wavelength are most often Gaia-classified as stars, while non-stellar components of galaxies appear in all Gaia classes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Active Galactic Nuclei and Little Red Dots with the Obelisk simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space telescope has discovered an abundant population of broad line emitters, typical signposts for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Many of these sources have red colors and a compact appearance that has led to naming them `Little Red Dots'. In this paper we develop a detailed framework to estimate the photometry of AGN embedded in galaxies extracted from the Obelisk cosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected Little Red Dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole population. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and attenuation for AGN we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as galaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is not too much or too little attenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGN do not enter the cLRD selection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue filters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs are also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington, and/or high ratios between black hole and stellar mass.</description>

      <title>FRB Line-of-sight Ionization Measurement From Lightcone AAOmega Mapping Survey: the First Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first public data release (DR1) of the FRB Line-of-sight Ionization Measurement From Lightcone AAOmega Mapping (FLIMFLAM) Survey, a wide field spectroscopic survey targeted on the fields of 10 precisely localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). DR1 encompasses spectroscopic data for 10,468 galaxy redshifts across 10 FRBs fields with z&lt;0.4, covering approximately 26 deg^2 of the sky in total. FLIMFLAM is composed of several layers, encompassing the `Wide' (covering ~ degree or &gt;10 Mpc scales), `Narrow', (several-arcminute or ~ Mpc) and integral field unit (`IFU'; ~ arcminute or ~ 100 kpc ) components. The bulk of the data comprise spectroscopy from the 2dF-AAOmega on the 3.9-meter Anglo-Australian Telescope, while most of the Narrow and IFU data was achieved using an ensemble of 8-10-meter class telescopes. We summarize the information on our selected FRB fields, the criteria for target selection, methodologies employed for data reduction, spectral analysis processes, and an overview of our data products. An evaluation of our data reveals an average spectroscopic completeness of 48.43%, with over 80% of the observed targets having secure redshifts. Additionally, we describe our approach on generating angular masks and calculating the target selection functions, setting the stage for the impending reconstruction of the matter density field.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Model of Gravitational Collapse Induced by Radiative Cooling: Instability Scale, Infall Velocity, and Accretion Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytic description of the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of radiatively cooling gas clouds. The approach is based on developing the "one-zone" density-temperature relationship of the gas into a full dynamical model. We convert this density-temperature relationship into a barotropic equation of state, which we use to calculate the density and velocity profiles of the gas. From these quantities we calculate the time-dependent mass accretion rate onto the center of the cloud. The approach clarifies the mechanism by which radiative cooling induces gravitational instability. In particular, we distinguish the rapid, quasi-equilibrium contraction of a cooling gas core to high central densities from the legitimate instability this contraction establishes in the envelope. We develop a refined criterion for the mass scale of this instability, based only on the chemical-thermal evolution in the core. We explicate our model in the context of a primordial mini-halo cooled by molecular hydrogen, and then provide two further examples, a delayed collapse with hydrogen deuteride cooling and the collapse of an atomic cooling halo. In all three cases, our results agree well with full hydrodynamical treatments.</description>

      <title>Peering into the Heart of the Giant Molecular Cloud G148.24+00.41: A Deep Near-infrared View of the Newly Hatched Cluster FSR 655</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed near-infrared study of an embedded cluster located in the hub of the giant molecular cloud G148.24+00.41 of mass $\sim$10$^5$ $M_\odot$, with the TANSPEC instrument mounted on the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope. The hub is located near the geometric center of the cloud and represents its most massive clump. We studied the central 2 pc $\times$ 2 pc area of the hub with 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitudes of 20.5, 20.1, and 18.6 mag in the $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ bands, respectively. Using the $K_s$-band luminosity function and comparing it with the synthetic clusters, we obtained the age of the cluster as $\sim$0.5 Myr, which was found to corroborate well with the visual extinction versus the age of nearby embedded clusters. We find that the present mass of the cluster is around $\sim$180 $M_\odot$, and the cluster is currently forming stars at a rate of $\sim$330 $M_\odot$ $\rm{Myr}^{-1}$, with an efficiency of $\sim$20%. The cluster is connected to an extended gas reservoir through a filamentary network; thus, we hypothesize that the cluster has the potential to become a richer cluster in a few Myr of time.</description>

      <title>M giants with IGRINS IV. Identification and characterization of a near-IR line of the s-element Barium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron-capture elements represent an important nucleosynthetic channel in the study of the Galactic Chemical Evolution of stellar populations. For stellar populations behind significant extinction, such as those in the Galactic Center and along the Galactic plane, abundance analyses based on near-IR spectra are necessary. Previously, spectral lines from the neutron-capture elements such as copper (Cu), cerium (Ce), neodymium (Nd), and ytterbium (Yb) have been identified in the H band, while yttrium (Y) lines have been identified in the K band. Due to the scarcity of spectral lines from neutron-capture elements in the near-IR, the addition of useful spectral lines from other neutron-capture elements is highly desirable. The aim of this work is to identify and characterise a spectral line suitable for abundance determination from the most commonly used s-process element, namely barium. We observed near-IR spectra of 37 M giants in the solar neighbourhood at high S/N and high spectral resolution using the IGRINS spectrometer on the GEMINI South telescope. Using a manual spectral synthesis method, we determined the stellar parameters for these stars and derived the barium abundance from the Ba line (6s5d $^3$D$_2 \rightarrow$ 6s6p $^3$P$^o_2$) at $\lambda_\mathrm{air}=23\,253.56\,$\AA\ in the K band. We demonstrate that the Ba line in the K band at 2.33\,\mic\ ($\lambda$23253.56) is useful for abundance analysis from spectra of M giants. The line becomes progressively weaker at higher temperatures and is only useful in M giants and the coolest K giants at supersolar metallicities. We can now add Ba to the trends of the heavy elements Cu, Zn, Y, Ce, Nd, and Yb, which can be retrieved from high-resolution H- and K-band spectra. This opens up the study of nucleosynthetic channels, including the s-process and the r-process, in dust-obscured populations such as the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Photofragmentation of Corannulene (C20H10) and Sumanene (C21H12) cations in gas phase and its Astrophysical implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aromatic infrared Bands (AIBs) dominate the mid-infrared spectra of many galactic and extragalactic sources. These AIBs are generally attributed to fluorescent emission from aromatic molecules. Unified efforts from experimentalists and theoreticians to assign these AIB features have recently gotten additional impetus with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) delivers mid-IR spectrum with greatly increased sensitivity and spectral resolution. PAHs in space can exist in either neutral or ionic forms, absorb UV photons and undergo fragmentation, becoming a rich source of small hydrocarbons. This top-down mechanism of larger PAHs fragmenting into smaller species is of utmost importance in photo-dissociation regions (PDR) in space. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the photo-fragmentation pathways of two astronomically significant PAH cations - corannulene (C20H10) and sumanene (C21H12) that are structural motifs of fullerene C60, to understand their sequential fragmentation pathways. The photo-fragmentation experiments exhibit channels that are much different from planar PAHs. The breakdown of carbon skeleton is found to have different pathways for C20H10 and C21H12 because of the number and positioning of pentagon rings; yet the most abundant low mass cations produced by these two species are found to be similar. The low mass cations showcased in this work could be of interest for their astronomical detections. For completeness, the qualitative photo fragmentation behaviour of the dicationic corannulene and sumanene have also been experimented, but the potential energy surface of these dications are beyond the scope of this paper.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced fragmentation of coronene cations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are an important component of the interstellar medium of galaxies and photochemistry plays a key role in the evolution of these species in space. Here, we explore the photofragmentation behaviour of the coronene cation (C24H12+) using time of flight mass spectrometry. The experiments show photodissociation fragmentation channels including the formation of bare carbon clusters (Cn+) and hydrocarbon chains (CnHx+). The mass spectrum of coronene is dominated by peaks from C11+ and C7H+. Density functional theory was used to calculate relative energies, potential dissociation pathways, and possible structures for relevant species. We identify 6-6 to 5-7 ring isomerisation as a key step in the formation of both the bare carbon clusters and the hydrocarbon chains observed in this study. We present the dissociation mechanism outlined here as a potential formation route for C60 and other astrochemically relevant species.</description>

Abstract: The discovery and characterization of free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) is fundamental to our understanding of star and planet formation. Here we report results from an extremely deep spectroscopic survey of the young star cluster NGC1333 using NIRISS WFSS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The survey is photometrically complete to K~21, and includes useful spectra for objects as faint as K~20.5. The observations cover 19 known brown dwarfs, for most of which we confirm spectral types using NIRISS spectra. We discover six new candidates with L-dwarf spectral types that are plausible planetary-mass members of NGC1333, with estimated masses between 5-15 MJup. One, at ~5 MJup, shows clear infrared excess emission and is a good candidate to be the lowest mass object known to have a disk. We do not find any objects later than mid-L spectral type (M &lt; ~4 MJup). The paucity of Jupiter-mass objects, despite the survey's unprecedented sensitivity, suggests that our observations reach the lowest mass objects formed like stars in NGC1333. Our findings put the fraction of FFPMOs in NGC1333 at ~10% of the number of cluster members, significantly more than expected from the typical log-normal stellar mass function. We also search for wide binaries in our images and report a young brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion.</description>

      <title>Variable Stars in M31 Stellar Clusters from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable stars in stellar clusters can offer key constraints on stellar evolution and pulsation models, utilising estimates of host cluster properties to constrain stellar physical parameters. We present a catalogue of 86 luminous (F814W&lt;19) variable stars in M31 clusters identified by mining the archival Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey using a combination of statistical analysis of sparse PHAT light curves and difference imaging. We determine the evolutionary phases and initial masses of these variable stars by matching them with theoretical isochrones generated using host cluster properties from the literature. We calculate the probability of PHAT photometry being blended due to the highly crowded nature of cluster environments for each cluster-variable star, using these probabilities to inform our level of confidence in the derived properties of each star. Our 86 cluster-variable stars have initial masses between 0.8--67 $M_{\odot}$. Their evolutionary phases span the main sequence, more evolved hydrogen- and helium-burning phases, and the post-asymptotic giant branch. We identify numerous candidate variable star types: RV Tauri variables, red supergiants and slowly pulsating B-type supergiants, along with Wolf Rayet stars, $\alpha$ Cygni and Mira variables, a classical Cepheid and a possible super-asymptotic giant. We characterise 12 cluster-variable stars at higher confidence based on their difference image quality and lower blending probability. Ours is the first systematic study of variable stars in extragalactic stellar clusters leveraging the superior resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope and demonstrating the unique power of stellar clusters in constraining the fundamental properties of variable stars.</description>

      <title>An automated method for finding the most distant quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys such as Euclid, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope (Roman) will detect hundreds of high-redshift (z &gt; 7) quasars, but distinguishing them from the billions of other sources in these catalogues represents a significant data analysis challenge. We address this problem by extending existing selection methods by using both i) Bayesian model comparison on measured fluxes and ii) a likelihood-based goodness-of-fit test on images, which are then combined using an Fbeta statistic. The result is an automated, reproduceable and objective high-redshift quasar selection pipeline. We test this on both simulations and real data from the cross-matched Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) catalogues. On this cross-matched dataset we achieve an AUC score of up to 0.795 and an F3 score of up to 0.79, sufficient to be applied to the Euclid, LSST and Roman data when available.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Protostellar Outflow Opening Angles and the Implications for the Growth of Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use 1-4" (300-1200 au) resolution 12CO(2-1) data from the MASSES (Mass Assembly of Stellar Systems and their Evolution with the SMA) project to measure the projected opening angles of 46 protostellar outflows in the Perseus Molecular Cloud, 37 of which are measured with sufficiently high confidence to use in further analysis. We find that there is a statistically significant difference in the distributions of outflow opening angles for Class 0 and Class I outflows, with a distinct lack of both wide-angle Class 0 outflows and highly collimated Class I outflows. Synthesizing our results with several previous studies, we find that outflows widen with age through the Class 0 stage but do not continue to widen in the Class I stage. The maximum projected opening angle reached is approximately 90 degrees +/- 20 degrees, with the transition between widening and remaining constant occurring near the boundary between the Class 0 and Class I phases of evolution. While the volume fractions occupied by these outflows are no more than a few tens of percent of the total core volume, at most, recent theoretical work suggests outflows may still be capable of playing a central role in setting the low star formation efficiencies of 25%-50% observed on core scales.</description>

      <title>New series expansion method for the periapsis shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new series expansion method for the periapsis shift. The method formulates the periapsis shift in various spacetimes analytically without using special functions and provides simple and highly accurate approximate formulae. We derive new series representations for the periapsis shift in the Kerr and the Chazy-Curzon spacetimes by using the method, where the expansion parameter is defined as the eccentricity divided by the non-dimensional quantity that vanishes in the limit of the innermost stable circular orbit. That is to say, the expansion parameter denotes how eccentric the orbit is and how close it is to the innermost stable circular orbit. The smaller the eccentricity, the higher the accuracy of the formulae that are obtained by truncating the new series representations up to a finite number of terms. If the eccentricity is sufficiently small, the truncated new representations have higher accuracy than the post-Newtonian expansion formulae even in strong gravitational fields where the convergence of the post-Newtonian expansion formula is not guaranteed. On the other hand, even if the orbit is highly eccentric, the truncated new representations have comparable or higher accuracy than the post-Newtonian expansion formulae if the semi-major axis is sufficiently large. An exact formula for the periapsis shift of the quasi-circular orbit in the Chazy-Curzon spacetime is also obtained as a special case of the new series representation.</description>

      <title>The rates and host galaxies of pair-instability supernovae through cosmic time: Predictions from BPASS and IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) have long been predicted to be the final fates of near-zero-metallicity very massive stars ($Z &lt; Z_\odot/3$, $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{ZAMS} \gtrsim 140 \mathrm{M}_\odot$). However, no definite PISN has been observed to date, leaving theoretical modelling validation open. To investigate the observability of these explosive transients, we combine detailed stellar evolution models for PISNe formation, computed from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code suite, BPASS, with the star formation history of all individual computational elements in the Illustris-TNG simulation. This allows us to compute comic PISN rates and predict their host galaxy properties. Of particular importance is that IllustrisTNG galaxies do not have uniform metallicities throughout, with metal-enriched galaxies often harbouring metal-poor pockets of gas where PISN progenitors may form. Accounting for the chemical inhomogeneities within these galaxies, we find that the peak redshift of PISNe formation is $z=3.5$ instead of the value of $z=6$ when ignoring chemical inhomogeneities within galaxies. Furthermore, the rate increases by an order of magnitude from 1.9 to 29 PISN Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z=0$, if the chemical inhomogeneities are considered. Using state-of-the-art theoretical PISN light curves, we find an observed rate of $13.8$ (1.2) visible PISNe per year for the Euclid-Deep survey, or $83$ (7.3) over the six-year lifetime of the mission when considering chemically inhomogeneous (homogenous) systems. Interestingly, only 12 per cent of helium PISN progenitors are sufficiently massive to power a super-luminous supernova event, which can potentially explain why PISN identification in time-domain surveys remains elusive and progress requires dedicated strategies.</description>

      <title>The Radio Spectra of High Luminosity Compact Symmetric Objects (CSO-2s): Implications for Studies of Compact Jetted Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses, for the first time, a key aspect of the phenomenology of Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) -- the characteristics of their radio spectra. We present a radio-spectrum description of a complete sample of high luminosity CSOs (CSO-2s), which shows that they exhibit the \textit{complete} range of spectral types, including flat-spectrum sources ($\alpha \ge -0.5$), steep-spectrum sources ($\alpha &lt; -0.5$), and peaked-spectrum sources. We show that there is no clear correlation between spectral type and size, but there is a correlation between the high-frequency spectral index and both object type and size. We also show that, to avoid biasing the data and to understand the various classes of jetted-AGN involved, the complete range of spectral types should be included in studying the general phenomenology of compact jetted-AGN, and that complete samples must be used, selected over a wide range of frequencies. We discuss examples that demonstrate these points. We find that the high-frequency spectral indices of CSO-2s span $-1.3 &lt;\alpha_{\rm hi} &lt; -0.3$, and hence that radio spectral signatures cannot be used to discriminate definitively between CSO-2s, binary galactic nuclei, and millilensed objects, unless they have $\alpha_{\rm hi} &gt;-0.3$.</description>

      <title>Constraining binary mergers in AGN disks using the non-observation of lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dense and dynamic environments within active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks may serve as prolific birthplaces for binary black holes (BBHs) and one possible origin for some of the BBHs detected by gravitational-wave (GW) observatories. We show that a considerable fraction of the BBH in AGN disks will be strongly lensed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Thus, the non-observation of lensed GW signals can be used to constrain the fraction of BBH binaries residing in AGN disks. The non-detection of lensing with current ${\cal O}(100)$ detections will be sufficient to start placing constraints on the fraction of BBHs living within accretion disks near the SMBH. In the next-generation detectors era, with ${\cal O}(10^5)$ BBH observations and no lensed events, we will be able to rule out most migration traps as dominant birthplaces of BBH mergers; moreover, we will be able to constrain the minimum size of the accretion disk. On the other hand, should AGNs constitute a major formation channel, lensed events from AGNs will become prominent in the future.</description>

      <title>JADES. The diverse population of infant Black Holes at 4&lt;z&lt;11: merging, tiny, poor, but mighty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 12 new AGN at 4&lt;z&lt;7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z=10.6) revealed through the detection of a Broad Line Region as seen in Halpha. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases we find evidence for two broad components of Halpha which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs). The inferred BH masses range between 8 x 10^7 Msun down to 4 x 10^5 Msun, interestingly probing the regime expected for Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs). The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities (~10^44-10^45 erg/s) imply accretion rates that are &lt; 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BHs, with M_BH ~ 10^6 Msun, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BH at z~4-11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies stellar masses when compared to the local M_BH-Mstar relation, and even approaching M_BH~Mstar, as expected for DCBHs and super-Eddington scenarios. However, we find that these early BHs tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M_BH and velocity dispersion, as well as between M_BH and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the BPT excitation-diagnostic diagram these AGN are located in the region that is that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what expected for AGN hosted in metal poor galaxies (Z ~ 0.1-0.2 Zsun). The fraction of broad line AGN with L_AGN &gt; 10^44 erg/s, among galaxies in the redshift range 4&lt;z&lt;6, is about 10%, suggesting that the contribution of AGN and their hosts to the reionization of the Universe is &gt; 10%.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: The core of an extremely massive proto-cluster at the Epoch of Reionization probed with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00899v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SPT0311-58 system resides in a massive dark matter halo at z ~ 6.9. It hosts two dusty galaxies (E and W) with a combined star formation rate of ~3500 Msun/yr. Its surrounding field exhibits an overdensity of sub-mm sources, making it a candidate proto-cluster.
  We use spatially-resolved spectroscopy provided by the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) to probe a field of view (FoV) ~ 17 x 17 kpc^2 around this object.
  These observations have revealed ten new galaxies at z ~ 6.9, characterised by dynamical masses spanning from ~10^9 to 10^10 Msun and a range in radial velocities of ~ 1500 km/s, in addition to the already known E and W galaxies. The implied large number density, and the wide spread in velocities, indicate that SPT0311-58 is at the core of a proto-cluster, immersed in a very massive dark matter halo of ~ 5 x 10^12 Msun. Hence, it represents the most massive proto-cluster ever found at the EoR. We also study the dynamical stage of the system and find that it likely is not fully virialised.
  The galaxies exhibit a great diversity of properties showing a range of evolutionary stages. We derive their ongoing Ha-based unobscured SFR, and find that its contribution to the total SF varies significantly across the galaxies in the system. Their ionization conditions range from those typical of field galaxies at similar redshift recently studied with JWST to those found in more evolved objects at lower z. The metallicity spans more than 0.8 dex across the FoV, reaching nearly solar values in some cases. The detailed IFU spectroscopy of the E galaxy reveals that it is actively assembling its stellar mass, showing sub-kpc inhomogeneities, and a metallicity gradient that can be explained by accretion of low metallicity gas from the IGM. The kinematic maps indicate departures from regular rotation, high turbulence, and a possible pre-collision minor merger. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Cold Filaments Formed in Hot Wake Flows Uplifted by Active Galactic Nucleus Bubbles in Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength observations indicate that the intracluster medium in some galaxy clusters contains cold filaments, while their formation mechanism remains debated. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show that cold filaments could naturally condense out of hot gaseous wake flows uplifted by the jet-inflated active galactic nucleus (AGN) bubbles. Consistent with observations, the simulated filaments extend to tens of kiloparsecs from the cluster center, with a representative mass of $\rm 10^{8}- 10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ for a typical AGN outburst energy of $10^{60}~ \rm erg$. They show smooth velocity gradients, stretching typically from inner inflows to outer outflows with velocity dispersions of several hundred kilometers per second. The properties of cold filaments are affected substantially by jet properties. Compared to kinetic-energy-dominated jets, thermal-energy-dominated jets are easier to produce long cold filaments with large masses as observed. AGN jets with an early turn-on time, a low jet base, or a very high power tend to overheat the cluster center, and produce short cold filaments that take a relatively long time to condense out.</description>

      <title>Evidence of extreme ionization conditions and low metallicity in GHZ2/GLASS-z12 from a combined analysis of NIRSpec and MIRI observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GHZ2/GLASS-z12 has been recently observed by JWST with both NIRSpec and MIRI spectrographs, making it the most distant galaxy ($z_{spec}=12.34$) with complete spectroscopic coverage from rest-frame UV to optical. It is identified as a strong CIV$_{1549}$ emitter with many detected emission lines (NIV], HeII, OIII], NIII], CIII], [OII], [NeIII], [OIII], and H$\alpha$), including a remarkable OIII$_{1333}$ Bowen fluorescence line. We analyze in this paper the joint NIRSpec+MIRI spectral data set. Combining six optical diagnostics (R2, R3, R23, O32, Ne3O2, and Ne3O2Hd), we find extreme ionization conditions, with O32 $=1.39 \pm 0.19$ and Ne3O2 $=0.37 \pm 0.18$ in stark excess compared to typical values in the ISM at lower redshifts. These line properties are compatible either with an AGN or with a compact, dense star-forming environment ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ $\sim 10^2$-$10^3$ Msun/yr/kpc$^2$), with a high ionization parameter ($\log_{10}$(U) $=-1.75 \pm 0.16$), a high ionizing photon production efficiency $\log(\xi_{\rm ion}) = 25.7_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$, and a low, although not pristine, metal content between $5\%$ and $11\%$ Z$_\odot$ (confirmed by the T$_e$ method), indicating a rapid metal enrichment in the last few Myrs. These properties also suggest that a substantial amount of ionizing photons ($\sim 10\%$) are leaking outside. The general lessons learned from GHZ2 are the following: (i) the UV to optical combined nebular indicators are broadly in agreement with UV-only or optical-only indicators. (ii) UV+optical diagnostics fail to discriminate between an AGN and star-formation in a low metallicity, high density, and extreme ionization environment. (iii) comparing the nebular line ratios with local analogs may be approaching its limits at $z \gtrsim 10$, as this approach is potentially challenged by the unique conditions of star formation experienced by galaxies at these extreme redshifts.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Quenched but Gas-rich Regions at Kiloparsec Scales in Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use resolved spectroscopy from MaNGA to investigate the significance of both local and global properties of galaxies to the cessation of star formation at kpc scales. Quenched regions are identified from a sample of isolated disk galaxies by a single-parameter criterion $\rm {D}_n(4000)$ - $\log$ $\rm {EW}({H\alpha})$$~&gt;1.6-\log 2=1.3$, and are divided into gas-rich quenched regions (GRQRs) and gas-poor quenched regions (GPQRs) according to the surface density of cold gas ($\rm \Sigma_{gas}$). Both types of quenched regions tend to be hosted by non-AGN galaxies with relatively high mass ($M_\ast$$\gtrsim 10^{10}M_\odot$) and red colors (${\rm NUV}-r \gtrsim 3$), as well as low star formation rate and high central density at fixed mass. They span wide ranges in other properties including structural parameters that are similar to the parent sample, indicating that the conditions responsible for quenching in gas-rich regions are largely independent on the global properties of galaxies. We train random forest (RF) classifiers and regressors for predicting quenching in our sample with 15 local/global properties. $\Sigma_\ast$ is the most important property for quenching, especially for GRQRs. These results strongly indicate the important roles of low-mass hot evolved stars which are numerous and long-lived in quenched regions and can provide substantial radiation pressure to support the surrounding gas against gravitational collapse. The different feature importance for quenching as found previously by Bluck et al. (2020a,b) are partly due to the different definitions of quenched regions, particularly the different requirements on $\rm {EW}({H\alpha})$.</description>

      <title>Fermi and eROSITA Bubbles as Persistent Structures of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles, large diffuse structures in our Galaxy, can be the by-products of the steady star formation activity. To simultaneously explain the star formation history of the Milky Way and the metallicity of $\sim$ Z$_\odot$ at the Galactic disk, a steady Galactic wind driven by cosmic-rays is required. For tenuous gases with a density of $\lesssim$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, the cosmic-ray heating dominates over radiative cooling, and the gas can maintain the virial temperature of $\sim$0.3 keV ideal for escape from the Galactic system as the wind. A part of the wind falls back onto the disk like a galactic fountain flow. We model the wind dynamics according to the Galactic evolution scenario and find that the scale height and surface brightness of the X-ray and the hadronic gamma-ray emissions from such fountain flow region can be consistent with the observed properties of the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. This implies that the bubbles are persistent structures of the Milky Way existing over (at least) the last $\sim$1 Gyr, rather than evanescent structures formed by non-trivial, $\sim$10 Myr past Galactic Center transient activities.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Inner 0.1 pc of a Supermassive Black Hole Environment with the Tidal Disruption Event and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter AT 2022upj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are objects showing transient high-ionization lines in the centers of galaxies. They have been attributed to echoes of high-energy flares of ionizing radiation, such as those produced by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but have only recently been observed within hundreds of days after an optical transient was detected. AT 2022upj is a nuclear UV-optical flare at z=0.054 with spectra showing [Fe X] {\lambda}6375 and [Fe XIV] {\lambda}5303 during the optical peak, the earliest presence of extreme coronal lines during an ongoing transient. AT 2022upj is also the second ever ECLE (and first with a concurrent flare) to show broad He II {\lambda}4686 emission, a key signature of optical/UV TDEs. We also detect X-ray emission during the optical transient phase, which may be related to the source of ionizing photons for the extreme coronal lines. Finally, we analyze the spectroscopic evolution of each emission line and find that [Fe X] and [Fe XIV] weaken within 400d of optical peak, while [Fe VII] {\lambda}5720, [Fe VII] {\lambda}6087, and [O III] {\lambda}{\lambda}4959,5007 emerge over the same period. The velocities of the iron lines indicate circumnuclear gas within 0.1pc of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while a dust echo inferred from NEOWISE data indicates that circumnuclear dust lies at a minimum of 0.4pc away, providing evidence of stratified material around a SMBH. AT 2022upj is the first confirmed ECLE-TDE with clear signatures of both classes. This event's spectroscopic evolution on a $\sim$year unveils the impact of highly energetic flares such as TDEs on the complex environments around SMBHs.</description>

      <title>The Valuable Long-period Cluster Cepheid KQ Scorpii and other Calibration Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Cepheid KQ Sco is a valuable anchor for the distance scale because of its long pulsation period ($28^{\rm d}.7$) and evidence implying membership in the open cluster UBC 1558. Analyses tied to Gaia DR3 astrometry, photometry, spectroscopy, radial velocities, and 2MASS-VVV photometry indicate a common distance of $2.15\pm0.15$ kpc (\citealt{lin21} DR3 corrections applied). Additional cluster Cepheid candidates requiring follow-up are identified, and it's suggested that a team of international researchers could maintain a cluster Cepheid database to guide the broader community to cases where consensus exists.</description>

      <title>The R-Process Alliance: Fifth Data Release from the Search for R-Process-Enhanced Metal-poor Stars in the Galactic Halo with the GTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the abundance pattern of metal-poor stars and the production of heavy elements through various nucleosynthesis processes offers crucial insights into the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, revealing primary sites and major sources of rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) material in the Universe. In this fifth data release from the $R$-Process Alliance, we present the detailed chemical abundances of 41 faint (down to V = 15.8) and extremely metal-poor (down to [Fe/H] = -3.3) halo stars selected from the R-Process Alliance (RPA). We obtained high-resolution spectra for these objects with the HORuS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We measure the abundances of light, alpha, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements. We report the discovery of five CEMP, one limited-$r$, three $r$-I, and four $r$-II stars, and six Mg-poor stars. We also identify one star of a possible globular cluster origin at an extremely low metallicity at [Fe/H] = -3.0. This adds to the growing evidence of a lower limit metallicity floor for globular cluster abundances. We use the abundances of Fe-peak elements and the alpha-elements to investigate the contributions from different nucleosynthesis channels in the progenitor supernovae. We find the distribution of [Mg/Eu] as a function of [Fe/H] to have different enrichment levels, indicating different possible pathways and sites of their production. We also reveal differences in the trends of the neutron-capture element abundances of Sr, Ba, and Eu of various $r$-I and $r$-II stars from the RPA data releases, which provide constraints on their nucleosynthesis sites and subsequent evolution.</description>
