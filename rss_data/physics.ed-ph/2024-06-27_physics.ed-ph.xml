      <title>Assisting Tibetan Students in Learning Quantum Mechanics via Mathematica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undergraduate students of physics in Tibet have great difficulty learning quantum mechanics (QM). We attempt to use PER-based methods to help Tibetan students learn QM. In this preliminary study, we incorporate Mathematica in a QM course at Tibet University and record students' learning experiences. Tibetan students tend to have subjective feelings of learning Mathematica, whereas Han students (majority) are more focused on the operational techniques of Mathematica. The results also suggest that both Tibetan students and Han students show limited improvement in time-independent Schrodinger equations after learning QM with Mathematica. Further effort is needed to improve the academic literacy skills of physics students in Tibet.</description>

      <title>Why Teach Quantum In Your Own Time: The Values of Grassroots Organizations Involved in Quantum Technologies Education and Outreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the intersection of goals and values within grassroots organizations operating in the realm of quantum technologies (QT) education. It delineates a fundamental distinction between the objective to provide education and the drive to democratize learning through principles of inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity. The analysis reveals how these organizations navigate their nascent stages, grappling with the dual challenge of adhering to their foundational values while aspiring for sustainable growth and development in the highly specialized field of QT. The study uncovers the strategic approaches adopted by these entities, including efforts to create educational ecosystems and foster community engagement. The research underscores the potential vulnerabilities of these grassroots organizations, particularly in relation to the longevity and evolution of their initiatives as members transition into professional roles within the quantum sector. Through this investigation, the paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of how emerging educational organizations in the QT field balance their ideological commitments with practical growth considerations, highlighting the critical factors that influence their trajectory and impact.</description>

      <title>CosmoAmautas: Astrophysics in the high school classroom (2nd edition)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the second edition of the book `CosmoAmautas: Astrophysics in the classroom' which is a text and activity book on selected topics in astrophysics. The content is written in Spanish and intended as the introductory literature and material for high school teachers who want to integrate astronomy to their science and math classes. The book includes an introduction to topics such as planetary science, stellar evolution, exoplanets, galaxies, black holes, and cosmology. In addition to the astronomy content, the book includes didactic notes on general physics of gravity and light, unit conversion, history of science, and tools for the digital classroom (ICT tools), which are compatible with the requirements of the Peruvian high school curriculum. This book is constructed based on the astrophysics curriculum and education model introduced in the online teacher-training workshop CosmoAmautas, which took place in 2021 and 2022. CosmoAmautas (amauta = teacher in the Quechua language) is an astronomy education project in Peru, funded by the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development.
