      <title>Linking numbers of Montesinos links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linking number of an oriented two-component link is an invariant indicating how intertwined the two components are. Tuler proved that the linking number of a two-component rational $\frac{p}{q}$-link is $$\sum^{\frac{|p|}{2}}_{k=1} (-1)^{\big\lfloor (2k-1) \frac{q}{p} \big\rfloor }.$$ In this paper, we provide a simple proof the above result, and introduce the numerical algorithm to find linking numbers of rational links. Using this result, we find linking numbers between any two components in a Montesinos link.</description>

      <title>Crushing Surfaces of Positive Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of crushing a normal surface has proven to be a powerful tool in computational $3$-manifold topology, with applications both to triangulation complexity and to algorithms. The main difficulty with crushing is that it can drastically change the topology of a triangulation, so applications to date have been limited to relatively simple surfaces: $2$-spheres, discs, annuli, and closed boundary-parallel surfaces. We give the first detailed analysis of the topological effects of crushing closed essential surfaces of positive genus. To showcase the utility of this new analysis, we use it to prove some results about how triangulation complexity interacts with JSJ decompositions and satellite knots; although similar applications can also be obtained using techniques of Matveev, our approach has the advantage that it avoids the machinery of almost simple spines and handle decompositions.</description>

      <title>Effective Computation of the Heegaard Genus of 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heegaard genus is a fundamental invariant of 3-manifolds. However, computing the Heegaard genus of a triangulated 3-manifold is NP-hard, and while algorithms exist, little work has been done in making such an algorithm efficient and practical for implementation. Current algorithms use almost normal surfaces, which are an extension of the algorithm-friendly normal surface theory but which add considerable complexity for both running time and implementation.
  Here we take a different approach: instead of working with almost normal surfaces, we give a general method of modifying the input triangulation that allows us to avoid almost normal surfaces entirely. The cost is just four new tetrahedra, and the benefit is that important surfaces that were once almost normal can be moved to the simpler setting of normal surfaces in the new triangulation. We apply this technique to the computation of Heegaard genus, where we develop algorithms and heuristics that prove successful in practice when applied to a data set of 3,000 closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds; we precisely determine the genus for at least 2,705 of these.</description>

      <title>Computing shortest closed curves on non-orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of computing shortest non-separating simple closed curves with some given topological properties on non-orientable surfaces. While, for orientable surfaces, any two non-separating simple closed curves are related by a self-homeomorphism of the surface, and computing shortest such curves has been vastly studied, for non-orientable ones the classification of non-separating simple closed curves up to ambient homeomorphism is subtler, depending on whether the curve is one-sided or two-sided, and whether it is orienting or not (whether it cuts the surface into an orientable one).
  We prove that computing a shortest orienting (weakly) simple closed curve on a non-orientable combinatorial surface is NP-hard but fixed-parameter tractable in the genus of the surface. In contrast, we can compute a shortest non-separating non-orienting (weakly) simple closed curve with given sidedness in $g^{O(1)}.n\log n$ time, where $g$ is the genus and $n$ the size of the surface.
  For these algorithms, we develop tools that can be of independent interest, to compute a variation on canonical systems of loops for non-orientable surfaces based on the computation of an orienting curve, and some covering spaces that are essentially quotients of homology covers.</description>

      <title>Relative aspherical conjecture and higher codimensional obstruction to positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the solution of the aspherical conjecture up to dimension 5 [CL20][Gro20], we want to study a relative version of the aspherical conjecture. We present a natural condition generalizing the model $X\times\mathbb{T}^k$ to the relative aspherical setting. Such model is closely related to submanifold obstruction of positive scalar curvature (PSC), and would be in similar spirit as [HPS15][CRZ23] in codim 2 case. In codim 3 and 4, we prove results on how 3-manifold obstructs the existence of PSC under our relative aspherical condition. This could be regarded as a relative version extension of the aspherical conjecture up to dim 5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that every noncompact surface has a (3,6)-tight triangulation, and a characterisation of such triangulations is given in terms of length constraints on the boundary walks of superfaces of a given genus. Applications are given to the generic rigidity of associated countable bar-joint frameworks in R^3. In particular, every noncompact surface has a (3,6)-tight triangulation that is minimally 3-rigid. A proof of Ker\'ekj\'art\'o's classification of noncompact surfaces is also given.</description>

      <title>Convex co-compact representations of 3-manifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.05191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A representation of a finitely generated group into the projective general linear group is called convex co-compact if it has finite kernel and its image acts convex co-compactly on a properly convex domain in real projective space. We prove that the fundamental group of a closed irreducible orientable 3-manifold can admit such a representation only when the manifold is geometric (with Euclidean, Hyperbolic, or Euclidean $\times$ Hyperbolic geometry) or when every component in the geometric decomposition is hyperbolic. In each case, we describe the structure of such examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.12303v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1994, Long and Moody introduced a method to construct a new representation of the braid group from the representation of the braid group or the semidirect product of the braid group and the free group. In this paper, we show that its matrix presentation is written using the Fox derivation, and also a relation with twisted Alexander invariants.</description>

      <title>Super-representations of 3-manifolds and torsion polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Torsion polynomials connect the genus of a hyperbolic knot (a topological invariant) with the discrete faithful representation (a geometric invariant). Using a new combinatorial structure of an ideal triangulation of a 3-manifold that involves edges as well as faces, we associate a polynomial to a cusped hyperbolic manifold that conjecturally agrees with the $\BC^2$-torsion polynomial, which conjecturally detects the genus of the knot. The new combinatorics is motivated by super-geometry in dimension 3, and more precisely by super-Ptolemy assignments of ideally triangulated 3-manifolds and their $\mathrm{OSp}_{2|1}(\BC)$-representations. Extended section 4, and added superalgebras with a single odd generator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a special alternating knot does not decompose as a non-trivial band sum. This restricts concordances from special alternating knots, and we conjecture that special alternating knots are ribbon concordance minimal. We verify our conjecture in many cases. This work is motivated by another conjecture of Owens and the second author, which posits that the set of alternating knots is downward closed under ribbon concordance.</description>

      <title>Natural real algebraic maps of non-positive codimensions with prescribed images whose boundaries consist of non-singular real algebraic hypersurfaces satisfying transversality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10723v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new real algebraic maps of non-positive codimensions with prescribed images whose boundaries consist of explicit non-singular real algebraic hypersurfaces satisfying so-called "transversality". We also give explicit information on important real polynomials. This gives new construction of explicit real algebraic maps of non-positive codimensions with explicit information on images, preimages and important real polynomials.
  Thanks to celebrated theory of Nash and Tognoli, smooth closed manifolds are non-singular real algebraic manifolds and the zero sets of some real polynomial maps. In considerable cases, we can approximate smooth functions or more generally, maps, by real algebraic ones. It is in general difficult to have explicit examples. We have constructed some previously. We have ones of some new type with explicit information on global structures of the maps.</description>

Abstract: For any right-angled Artin group $A_{\Gamma}$, Charney--Stambaugh--Vogtmann showed that the subgroup $U^0(A_{\Gamma}) \leq\text{Out}(A_{\Gamma})$ generated by Whitehead automorphisms and inversions acts properly and cocompactly on a contractible space $K_{\Gamma}$. In the present paper we show that any finite subgroup of $U^0(A_{\Gamma})$ fixes a point of $K_{\Gamma}$. This generalizes the fact that any finite subgroup of $\text{Out}(F_n)$ fixes a point of Outer Space, and implies that there are only finitely many conjugacy classes of finite subgroups in $U^0(A_{\Gamma})$.</description>

      <title>Hopf Arborescent Links, Minor Theory, and Decidability of the Genus Defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the problem of computing the genus of a knot is now fairly well understood, no algorithm is known for its four-dimensional variants, both in the smooth and in the topological locally flat category. In this article, we investigate a class of knots and links called Hopf arborescent links, which are obtained as the boundaries of some iterated plumbings of Hopf bands. We show that for such links, computing the genus defects, which measure how much the four-dimensional genera differ from the classical genus, is decidable. Our proof is non-constructive, and is obtained by proving that Seifert surfaces of Hopf arborescent links under a relation of minors defined by containment of their Seifert surfaces form a well-quasi-order.</description>
