      <title>Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) presents a pivotal challenge in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), profoundly impacting decision-making, risk assessment and model reliability. In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift. An ablation over ensemble size further demonstrates that CDEC attains stable uncertainty estimates with only a small ensemble.</description>

      <title>Ideal Observer for Segmentation of Dead Leaves Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human visual environment is comprised of different surfaces that are distributed in space. The parts of a scene that are visible at any one time are governed by the occlusion of overlapping objects. In this work we consider "dead leaves" models, which replicate these occlusions when generating images by layering objects on top of each other. A dead leaves model is a generative model comprised of distributions for object position, shape, color and texture. An image is generated from a dead leaves model by sampling objects ("leaves") from these distributions until a stopping criterion is reached, usually when the image is fully covered or until a given number of leaves was sampled. Here, we describe a theoretical approach, based on previous work, to derive a Bayesian ideal observer for the partition of a given set of pixels based on independent dead leaves model distributions. Extending previous work, we provide step-by-step explanations for the computation of the posterior probability as well as describe factors that determine the feasibility of practically applying this computation. The dead leaves image model and the associated ideal observer can be applied to study segmentation decisions in a limited number of pixels, providing a principled upper-bound on performance, to which humans and vision algorithms could be compared.</description>

      <title>Generalised Bayesian Inference using Robust divergences for von Mises-Fisher distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focusses on robust estimation of location and concentration parameters of the von Mises-Fisher distribution in the Bayesian framework. The von Mises-Fisher (or Langevin) distribution has played a central role in directional statistics. Directional data have been investigated for many decades, and more recently, they have gained increasing attention in diverse areas such as bioinformatics and text data analysis. Although outliers can significantly affect the estimation results even for directional data, the treatment of outliers remains an unresolved and challenging problem. In the frequentist framework, numerous studies have developed robust estimation methods for directional data with outliers, but, in contrast, only a few robust estimation methods have been proposed in the Bayesian framework. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference based on density power-divergence and $\gamma$-divergence and establish their asymptotic properties and robustness. In addition, the Bayesian approach naturally provides a way to assess estimation uncertainty through the posterior distribution, which is particularly useful for small samples. Furthermore, to carry out the posterior computation, we develop the posterior computation algorithm based on the weighted Bayesian bootstrap for estimating parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through simulation studies. Using two real datasets, we further show that the proposed method provides reliable and robust estimation even in the presence of outliers or data contamination.</description>

Abstract: We study monotone paths in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs on numbered vertices. Benjamini &amp; Tzalik established a phase transition at $p = \frac{\log n}{n}$ for this model. We refine the critical value to $p = \frac{\log n - \log \log n }{n}$ and identify the critical window of order $\Theta(1/n)$.</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Way: Uncertainty, Learning, and Statistical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian inference, combining historical context, theoretical foundations, and core analytical examples. Beginning with Bayes' theorem and the philosophical distinctions between Bayesian and frequentist approaches, we develop the inferential framework for estimation, interval construction, hypothesis testing, and prediction. Through canonical models, we illustrate how prior information and observed data are formally integrated to yield posterior distributions. We also explore key concepts including loss functions, credible intervals, Bayes factors, identifiability, and asymptotic behavior. While emphasizing analytical tractability in classical settings, we outline modern extensions that rely on simulation-based methods and discuss challenges related to prior specification and model evaluation. Though focused on foundational ideas, this paper sets the stage for applying Bayesian methods in contemporary domains such as hierarchical modeling, nonparametrics, and structured applications in time series, spatial data, networks, and political science. The goal is to provide a rigorous yet accessible entry point for students and researchers seeking to adopt a Bayesian perspective in statistical practice.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Finite Sample Bias in Time Series Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that model selection via cross validation can be biased for time series models. However, many researchers have argued that this bias does not apply when using cross-validation with vector autoregressions (VAR) or with time series models whose errors follow a martingale-like structure. I show that even under these circumstances, performing cross-validation on time series data will still generate bias in general.</description>

      <title>Efficient adjustment for complex covariates: Gaining efficiency with DOPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covariate adjustment is a ubiquitous method used to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) from observational data. Assuming a known graphical structure of the data generating model, recent results give graphical criteria for optimal adjustment, which enables efficient estimation of the ATE. However, graphical approaches are challenging for high-dimensional and complex data, and it is not straightforward to specify a meaningful graphical model of non-Euclidean data such as texts. We propose a new framework that accommodates adjustment for any subset of information expressed by the covariates, and we show that the information that is minimally sufficient for prediction of the outcome given the treatment is also most efficient for adjustment.
  Based on our theoretical results, we propose the Debiased Outcome-adapted Propensity Estimator (DOPE) for efficient estimation of the ATE, and we provide asymptotic results for DOPE under general conditions. Compared to the augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimator, DOPE can retain its efficiency even when the covariates are highly predictive of treatment. We illustrate this with a single-index model, and with an implementation of DOPE based on neural networks, we demonstrate its performance on simulated and real data. Our results show that DOPE provides an efficient and robust methodology for ATE estimation in various observational settings.</description>

      <title>Second Maximum of a Gaussian Random Field and Exact (t-)Spacing test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the novel concept of the second maximum of a Gaussian random field on a Riemannian submanifold. This second maximum serves as a powerful tool for characterizing the distribution of the maximum. By utilizing an ad-hoc Kac Rice formula, we derive the explicit form of the maximum's distribution, conditioned on the second maximum and some regressed component of the Riemannian Hessian. This approach results in an exact test, based on the evaluation of spacing between these maxima, which we refer to as the spacing test.
  We investigate the applicability of this test in detecting sparse alternatives within Gaussian symmetric tensors, continuous sparse deconvolution, and two-layered neural networks with smooth rectifiers. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which illustrate the calibration and power of the proposed tests. More generally, this test can be applied to any Gaussian random field on a Riemannian manifold, and we provide a general framework for the application of the spacing test in continuous sparse kernel regression.
  Furthermore, when the variance-covariance function of the Gaussian random field is known up to a scaling factor, we derive an exact Studentized version of our test, coined the $t$-spacing test. This test is perfectly calibrated under the null hypothesis and has high power for detecting sparse alternatives.</description>

      <title>Bivariate Matrix-valued Linear Regression (BMLR): Finite-sample performance under Identifiability and Sparsity Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the estimation of parameters in a matrix-valued linear regression model, where the $T$ responses $(Y_t)_{t=1}^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ and predictors $(X_t)_{t=1}^T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times q}$ satisfy the relationship $Y_t = A^* X_t B^* + E_t$ for all $t = 1, \ldots, T$. In this model, $A^* \in \mathbb{R}_+^{n \times m}$ has $L_1$-normalized rows, $B^* \in \mathbb{R}^{q \times p}$, and $(E_t)_{t=1}^T$ are independent noise matrices following a matrix Gaussian distribution. The primary objective is to estimate the unknown parameters $A^*$ and $B^*$ efficiently.
  We propose explicit optimization-free estimators and establish non-asymptotic convergence rates to quantify their performance. Additionally, we extend our analysis to scenarios where $A^*$ and $B^*$ exhibit sparse structures. To support our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical simulations that confirm the behavior of the estimators, particularly with respect to the impact of the dimensions $n, m, p, q$, and the sample size $T$ on finite-sample performances. We complete the simulations by investigating the denoising performances of our estimators on noisy real-world images.</description>

      <title>Statistical Guarantees for Approximate Stationary Points of Shallow Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since statistical guarantees for neural networks are usually restricted to global optima of intricate objective functions, it is unclear whether these theories explain the performances of actual outputs of neural network pipelines. The goal of this paper is, therefore, to bring statistical theory closer to practice. We develop statistical guarantees for shallow linear neural networks that coincide up to logarithmic factors with the global optima but apply to stationary points and the points nearby. These results support the common notion that neural networks do not necessarily need to be optimized globally from a mathematical perspective. We then extend our statistical guarantees to shallow ReLU neural networks, assuming the first layer weight matrices are nearly identical for the stationary network and the target. More generally, despite being limited to shallow neural networks for now, our theories make an important step forward in describing the practical properties of neural networks in mathematical terms.</description>

      <title>Operator learning meets inverse problems: A probabilistic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator learning offers a robust framework for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It has also become a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in the computational sciences. This chapter surveys methodological and theoretical developments at the intersection of operator learning and inverse problems. It begins by summarizing the probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, and pays special attention to emerging measure-centric formulations that treat observed data or unknown parameters as probability distributions. The discussion then turns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data generation, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing function-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end inverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to the solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the forward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this data-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both point predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the estimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more selectively within classical inversion algorithms.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm towards multimodal distributions on Rd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an earlier joint work, we studied a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure supported on torus with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature, where we proved that the time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the inverse temperature. However, the analysis in that torus setting relied crucially on compactness and does not directly extend to unbounded domains. This work introduces a new approach that resolves this issue and establishes a similar result for sampling from Gibbs measures supported on Rd. In particular, our main result shows that for double-well energy with equal well depths, the time complexity scales as seventh power of the inverse temperature, and quadratically in both the inverse allowed absolute error and probability error.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Valid Rank Confidence Sets for a Broad Class of Statistical and Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ranking populations such as institutions based on certain characteristics is often of interest, and these ranks are typically estimated using samples drawn from the populations. Due to sample randomness, it is important to quantify the uncertainty associated with the estimated ranks. This becomes crucial when latent characteristics are poorly separated and where many rank estimates may be incorrectly ordered. Understanding uncertainty can help quantify and mitigate these issues and provide a fuller picture. However, this task is especially challenging because the rank parameters are discrete and the central limit theorem does not apply to the rank estimates. In this article, we propose a Repro Samples Method to address this nontrivial inference problem by developing a confidence set for the true, unobserved population ranks. This method provides finite-sample coverage guarantees and is broadly applicable to ranking problems. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated and compared with several published large sample ranking approaches using simulation studies and real data examples involving samples both from traditional statistical models and modern data science algorithms.</description>
