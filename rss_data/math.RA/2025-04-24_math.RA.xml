      <title>The Nilpotency of the Nil Metric $\mathbb{F}$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a normed field. In this work, we prove that every nil complete metric $\mathbb{F}$-algebra is nilpotent when $\mathbb{F}$ has characteristic zero. This result generalizes Grabiner's Theorem for Banach algebras, first proved in 1969. Furthermore, we show that a metric $\mathbb{F}$-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ and its completion $C(\mathfrak{A})$ satisfy the same polynomial identities, and consequently, if $\mathsf{char}(\mathbb{F})=0$ and $C(\mathfrak{A})$ is nil, then $\mathfrak{A}$ is nilpotent. Our results allow us to resolve K\"othe's Problem affirmatively for complete metric algebras over normed fields of characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Commuting degree for BCK-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the following question: given a finite BCK-algebra, what is the probability that two randomly selected elements commute? We call this probability the \textit{commuting degree} of a BCK-algebra. In a previous paper, the author gave sharp upper and lower bounds for the commuting degree of a BCK-algebra with order $n$. We expand on those results in this paper: we show that, for each $n\geq 3$, there is a BCK-algebra of order $n$ realizing each possible commuting degree and that the minimum commuting degree is achieved by a unique BCK-algebra of order $n$ Additionally, we show that every rational number in $(0,1]$ is the commuting degree of some finite BCK-algebra.</description>

      <title>On the length of generating sets with conditions on minimal polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear upper bounds may be derived by imposing specific structural conditions on a generating set, such as additional constraints on ranks, eigenvalues, or the degree of the minimal polynomial of the generating matrices. This paper establishes a linear upper bound of \(3n-5\) for generating sets that contain a matrix whose minimal polynomial has a degree exceeding \(\frac{n}{2}\), where \(n\) denotes the order of the matrix. Compared to the bound provided in \cite[Theorem 3.1]{r2}, this result reduces the constraints on the Jordan canonical forms. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the bound \(\frac{7n}{2}-4\) holds when the generating set contains a matrix with a minimal polynomial of degree \(t\) satisfying \(2t\le n\le 3t-1\). The primary enhancements consist of quantitative bounds and reduced reliance on Jordan form structural constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formula that relates the Turaev coaction and the Goncharov-Brown coaction. Motivated by this relation, we introduce the reduced coaction equation. The skew-symmetric solutions to this equation form a Lie algebra under Ihara bracket.</description>

      <title>Symmetric semi-invariants for some Inonu-Wigner contractions-II-Case B even</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a proper parabolic subalgebra p of a simple Lie algebra g and the Inonu-Wigner contraction of p with respect to its decomposition into its standard Levi factor and its nilpotent radical : this is the Lie algebra which is isomorphic to p as a vector space, but where the nilpotent radical becomes an abelian ideal of this contraction. The study of the algebra of symmetric semi-invariants under the adjoint action associated with such a contraction was initiated in my paper entitled : Symmetric Semi-Invariants for some Inonu-Wigner Contractions-I, published in Transformation Groups, January 2025, wherein a lower bound for the formal character of this algebra was built, when the latter is well defined. Here in this paper we build an upper bound for this formal character, when p is a maximal parabolic subalgebra in a classical simple Lie algebra g in type B, when the Levi subalgebra of p is associated with the set of all simple roots without a simple root of even index with Bourbaki notation (we call this case the even case). We show that both bounds coincide. This provides a Weierstrass section for the algebra of symmetric semi-invariants associated with such a contraction and the polynomiality of such an algebra follows.</description>

      <title>The autotopism group of a family of commutative semifields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We completely determine the autotopism group of the (as of now) largest family of commutative semifields found by G\"olo\u{g}lu and K\"olsch. Since this family of semifields generally does not have large nuclei, this process is considerably harder than for families considered in preceding work. Our results show that all autotopisms are semilinear over the degree 2 subfield and that the autotopism group is always solvable. Using known connections, our results also completely determine the automorphism groups of the associated rank-metric codes and the collineation groups of the associated translation planes.</description>

      <title>Hochschild (Co)homology of D-modules on rigid analytic spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth $p$-adic Stein space with free tangent sheaf. We use the notion of Hochschild cohomology for sheaves of Ind-Banach algebras developed in our previous work to study the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra of infinite order differential operators $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap. In particular, we show that the Hochschild cohomology complex of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap is a strict complex of nuclear Fr\'echet spaces which is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. We then use this to compare the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with a wide array of Ext functors. Finally, we investigate the relation of the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with the deformation theory of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap. Assuming some finiteness conditions on the de Rham cohomology of $X$, we define explicit isomorphisms between the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of bounded outer derivations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap, and between the second Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of infinitesimal deformations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap.</description>

      <title>Sombor index and eigenvalues of weakly zero-divisor graph of commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weakly zero-divisor graph $W\Gamma(R)$ of a commutative ring $R$ is the simple undirected graph whose vertices are nonzero zero-divisors of $R$ and two distinct vertices $x$, $y$ are adjacent if and only if there exist $w\in {\rm ann}(x)$ and $ z\in {\rm ann}(y)$ such that $wz =0$. In this paper, we determine the Sombor index for the weakly zero-divisor graph of the integers modulo ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Furthermore, we investigate the Sombor spectrum and establish bounds for the Sombor energy of the weakly zero-divisor graph of $\mathbb{Z}_n$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Surfaces via Complex Quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces play a fundamental role in differential geometry, with applications spanning physics, material science, and geometric design. In this paper, we explore a novel quaternionic representation of minimal surfaces, drawing an analogy with the well-established theory of Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curves. By exploiting the algebraic structure of complex quaternions, we introduce a new approach to generating minimal surfaces via quaternionic transformations. This method extends classical Weierstra\ss-Enneper representations and provides insights into the interplay between quaternionic analysis, PH curves, and minimal surface geometry. Additionally, we discuss the role of the Sylvester equation in this framework and demonstrate practical examples, including the construction of Enneper surface patches. The findings open new avenues in computational geometry and geometric modeling, bridging abstract algebraic structures with practical applications in CAD and computer graphics.</description>

      <title>$(2B, 3A, 5A)$-subalgebras of the Griess algebra with alternating Miyamoto group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Majorana representations to study the subalgebras of the Griess algebra that have shape $(2B,3A,5A)$ and whose associated Miyamoto groups are isomorphic to $A_n$. We prove that these subalgebras exist only if $n\in \{5,6,8\}$. The case $n=5$ was already treated by Ivanov, Seress, McInroy, and Shpectorov. In case $n=6$ we prove that these algebras are all isomorphic and provide their precise description. In case $n=8$ we prove that these algebras do not arise from standard Majorana representations.</description>

      <title>Bialgebra theory and $\mathcal O$-operators of admissible Hom-Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present and explore several key concepts within the framework of Hom-Poisson algebras. Specifically, we introduce the notions of admissible Hom-Poisson algebras, along with the related ideas of matched pairs and Manin triples for such algebras. We then define the concept of a purely admissible Hom-Poisson bialgebra, placing particular emphasis on its compatibility with the Manin triple structure associated with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form. This compatibility is crucial for understanding the structural interplay between these algebraic objects. Additionally, we investigate the notion of Hom-$ \mathcal O$-operators acting on admissible Hom-Poisson algebras. We analyze their properties and establish a connection with admissible Hom-pre-Poisson algebras, shedding light on the relationship between these two structures.</description>
