      <title>Formation of motile cell clusters in heterogeneous model tumors: the role of cell-cell alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circulating tumor cell clusters play an important role in the metastatic cascade. These clusters can acquire a migratory and more invasive phenotype, and coordinate their motion to migrate as a collective. Before such clusters can form by collectively detaching from a primary tumor, however, the cluster must first aggregate in the tumor interior. The mechanism of this cluster formation process is still poorly understood. One of the possible ways for cells to cluster is by aligning their direction of motion with their neighboring cells. This work aims to investigate the role of this cell-cell alignment interaction on the formation of motile cell clusters inside the bulk of a tumor using computer simulations. We employ a Cellular Potts model in which we model a two-dimensional heterogeneous confluent layer containing both motile and non-motile cells. Our results indicate that the degree of clustering is governed by two distinct processes: the formation of clusters due to the presence of cell-cell alignment interactions among motile cells, and the suppression of clustering due to the presence of the dynamic cellular environment (comprised of the non-motile cells). We find that the largest motile clusters are formed for intermediate alignment strengths, contrary to what is observed for motile cells in free space (that is, unimpeded by a dense cellular environment), in which case stronger cell-cell alignment always leads to larger clustering. Our findings suggest that the presence of a densely-packed cellular environment and strong cell-cell alignment inhibits the formation of large migratory clusters within the primary tumor, providing physical insight into potential factors at play during the early stages of metastasis.</description>

      <title>A first-principles geometric model for dynamics of motor-driven centrosomal asters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centrosomal aster is a mobile cellular organelle that exerts and transmits forces necessary for nuclear migration and spindle positioning. Recent experimental and theoretical studies of nematode and human cells demonstrate that pulling forces on asters by cortical force generators are dominant during such processes. We present a comprehensive investigation of a first-principles model of aster dynamics, the S-model (S for stoichiometry), based solely on such forces. The model evolves the astral centrosome position, a probability field of cell-surface motor occupancy by centrosomal microtubules (under an assumption of stoichiometric binding), and free boundaries of unattached, growing microtubules. We show how cell shape affects the centering stability of the aster, and its transition to oscillations with increasing motor number. Seeking to understand observations in single-cell nematode embryos, we use accurate simulations to examine the nonlinear structures of the bifurcations, and demonstrate the importance of binding domain overlap to interpreting genetic perturbation experiments. We find a rich dynamical landscape, dependent upon cell shape, such as internal equatorial orbits of asters that can be seen as traveling wave solutions. Finally, we study the interactions of multiple asters and demonstrate an effective mutual repulsion due to their competition for cortical force generators. We find, amazingly, that asters can relax onto the vertices of platonic and non-platonic solids, closely mirroring the results of the classical Thomson problem for energy-minimizing configurations of electrons constrained to a sphere and interacting via repulsive Coulomb potentials. Our findings both explain experimental observations, providing insights into the mechanisms governing spindle positioning and cell division dynamics, and show the possibility of new nonlinear phenomena in cell biology.</description>

      <title>Simulating spin biology using a digital quantum computer: Prospects on a near-term quantum hardware emulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate quantum spin dynamics of radical pair reactions is crucial for unraveling the underlying nature of chemical processes across diverse scientific domains. In this work, we leverage Trotterization to map coherent radical pair spin dynamics onto a digital gate-based quantum simulation. Our results demonstrated agreement between the idealized noiseless quantum circuit simulation and established master equation approaches for homogeneous radical pair recombination, identifying approximately 15 Trotter steps to be sufficient for faithfully reproducing the coupled spin dynamics of a prototypical system. By utilizing this computational technique to study the dynamics of spin systems of biological relevance, our findings underscore the potential of digital quantum simulation (DQS) of complex radical pair reactions and builds the groundwork towards more utilitarian investigations into their intricate reaction dynamics. We further investigate the effect of realistic error models on our DQS approach, and provide an upper limit for the number of Trotter steps that can currently be applied in the absence of error mitigation techniques before losing simulation accuracy to deleterious noise effects.</description>

      <title>Self-organized transport in noisy dynamic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of multi-commodity transport in a noisy, nonlinear network. The nonlinearity determines the dynamics of the edge capacities, which can be amplified or suppressed depending on the local current flowing across an edge. We consider network self-organization for three different nonlinear functions: For all three we identify parameter regimes where noise leads to self-organization into more robust topologies, that are not found by the sole noiseless dynamics. Moreover, the interplay between noise and specific functional behavior of the nonlinearity gives rise to different features, such as (i) continuous or discontinuous responses to the demand strength and (ii) either single or multi-stable solutions. Our study shows the crucial role of the activation function on noise-assisted phenomena.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Monte Carlo methods for three-dimensional diffusive capture problems in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular scale decision making is modulated by the dynamics of signalling molecules and their diffusive trajectories from a source to small absorbing sites on the cellular surface. Diffusive capture problems are computationally challenging due to the complex geometry and the applied boundary conditions together with intrinsically long transients that occur before a particle is captured. This paper reports on a particle-based Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that provides rapid accurate simulation of arrival statistics for (i) a half-space bounded by a surface with a finite collection of absorbing traps and (ii) the domain exterior to a convex cell again with absorbing traps. We validate our method by replicating classical results and in addition, newly developed boundary homogenization theories and matched asymptotic expansions on capture rates. In the case of non-spherical domains, we describe a new shielding effect in which geometry can play a role in sharpening cellular estimates on the directionality of diffusive sources.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Catalytic Mechanism of Molybdenum Cofactors: A Novel Coupled Cluster Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we use modern electronic structure methods to model the catalytic mechanism of different variants of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco). We investigate the dependence of various Moco model systems on structural relaxation and the importance of environmental effects for five critical points along the reaction coordinate with the DMSO and NO$_3^-$ substrates. Furthermore, we scrutinize the performance of various coupled-cluster approaches for modeling the relative energies along the investigated reaction paths, focusing on several pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) flavors and conventional coupled cluster approximations. Moreover, we elucidate the Mo--O bond formation using orbital-based quantum information measures, which highlight the flow of $\sigma_{\rm M-O}$ bond formation and $\sigma_{\rm N/S-O}$ bond breaking. Our study shows that pCCD-based models are a viable alternative to conventional methods and offer us unique insights into the bonding situation along a reaction coordinate. Finally, this work highlights the importance of environmental effects or changes in the core and, consequently, in the model itself to elucidate the change in activity of different Moco variants.</description>

      <title>An agent-based model of behaviour change calibrated to reversal learning data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behaviour change lies at the heart of many observable collective phenomena such as the transmission and control of infectious diseases, adoption of public health policies, and migration of animals to new habitats. Representing the process of individual behaviour change in computer simulations of these phenomena remains an open challenge. Often, computational models use phenomenological implementations with limited support from behavioural data. Without a strong connection to observable quantities, such models have limited utility for simulating observed and counterfactual scenarios of emergent phenomena because they cannot be validated or calibrated. Here, we present a simple stochastic individual-based model of reversal learning that captures fundamental properties of individual behaviour change, namely, the capacity to learn based on accumulated reward signals, and the transient persistence of learned behaviour after rewards are removed or altered. The model has only two parameters, and we use approximate Bayesian computation to demonstrate that they are fully identifiable from empirical reversal learning time series data. Finally, we demonstrate how the model can be extended to account for the increased complexity of behavioural dynamics over longer time scales involving fluctuating stimuli. This work is a step towards the development and evaluation of fully identifiable individual-level behaviour change models that can function as validated submodels for complex simulations of collective behaviour change.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and stochastic simulations of chemically active droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates play a central role in the spatial organization of living matter. Their formation is now well understood as a form of liquid-liquid phase separation that occurs very far from equilibrium. For instance, they can be modeled as active droplets, where the combination of molecular interactions and chemical reactions result in microphase separation. However, so far, models of chemically active droplets are spatially continuous and deterministic. Therefore, the relationship between the microscopic parameters of the models and some crucial properties of active droplets (such as their polydispersity, their shape anisotropy, or their typical lifetime) is yet to be established. In this work, we address this question computationally, using Brownian dynamics simulations of chemically active droplets: the building blocks are represented explicitly as particles that interact with attractive or repulsive interactions, depending on whether they are in a droplet-forming state or not. Thanks to this microscopic and stochastic view of the problem, we reveal how driving the system away from equilibrium in a controlled way determines the fluctuations and dynamics of active emulsions.</description>

      <title>Action potential propagation properties of 4D, 3D and 2D Hodgkin-Huxley type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between sodium (Na$^+$) and potassium (K$^+$) gating variables in the 4-dimensional (4D) Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) electrophysiology model and reduce its complexity by deriving new 3D and 2D models that retain the original model's dynamic properties. The new 3D and 2D models are based on the relationship $h \simeq c - n$ between the gating variables $h$ and $n$ of the 4D HH model, where $c$ is a constant, which suggests an interdependence between the dynamics of Na$^+$ and K$^+$ transmembrane voltage-gated channels. We derive the corresponding cable equations for the three HH-type models and demonstrate that the action potential propagates along the axon at a speed described by $v(R, C_m) = \alpha / (C_m R^{\beta}) = \gamma D^{\beta}$, where $\alpha &gt; 0$, $0 &lt; \beta &lt; 1$, and $\gamma$ are constants independent of the local stimulus intensity, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the electric signal along the axon, $C_m$ is the axon transmembrane capacitance, and $R$ is the axon conducting resistivity. The width $w$ of the action potential spikes is inversely related to the resistivity of the axon, with $w = \alpha_2 / R^{\beta_2}$, where $\alpha_2 &gt; 0$ and $\beta_2 &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional vertex model for curvy cell-cell interfaces at the subcellular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-sections of cell shapes in a tissue monolayer typically resemble a tiling of convex polygons. Yet, examples exist where the polygons are not convex with curved cell-cell interfaces, as seen in the adaxial epidermis. To date, two-dimensional vertex models predicting the structure and mechanics of cell monolayers have been mostly limited to convex polygons. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a framework to study curvy cell-cell interfaces at the subcellular scale within vertex models by using a parameterized curve between vertices that is expanded in a Fourier series and whose coefficients represent additional degrees of freedom. This extension to non-convex polygons allows for cells with same shape index, or dimensionless perimeter, to be, for example, either elongated or globular with lobes. In the presence of applied, anisotropic stresses, we find that local, subcellular curvature, or buckling, can be energetically more favorable than larger scale deformations involving groups of cells. Inspired by recent experiments, we also find that local, subcellular curvature at cell-cell interfaces emerges in a group of cells in response to the swelling of additional cells surrounding the group. Our framework, therefore, can account for a wider array of multi-cellular responses to constraints in the tissue environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomly moving active particles can be herded into directed motion by asymmetric geometric structures. Although such a rectification process has been extensively studied due to its fundamental, biological, and technological relevance, a comprehensive understanding of active matter rectification based on single particle dynamics remains elusive. Here, by combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we study the directed transport and energetics of swimming bacteria navigating through funnel-shaped obstacles -- a paradigmatic model of rectification of living active matter. We develop a microscopic parameter-free model for bacterial rectification, which quantitatively explains experimental and numerical observations and predicts the optimal geometry for the maximum rectification efficiency. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of time irreversibility and measure the extractable work associated with bacterial rectification. Our study provides quantitative solutions to long-standing questions on bacterial rectification and establishes a generic relationship between time irreversibility, particle fluxes, and extractable work, shedding light on the energetics of non-equilibrium rectification processes in living systems.</description>

      <title>Tensor formalism for predicting synaptic connections with ensemble modeling or optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical neuroscientists often try to understand how the structure of a neural network relates to its function by focusing on structural features that would either follow from optimization or occur consistently across possible implementations. Both optimization theories and ensemble modeling approaches have repeatedly proven their worth, and it would simplify theory building considerably if predictions from both theory types could be derived and tested simultaneously. Here we show how tensor formalism from theoretical physics can be used to unify and solve many optimization and ensemble modeling approaches to predicting synaptic connectivity from neuronal responses. We specifically focus on analyzing the solution space of synaptic weights that allow a threshold-linear neural network to respond in a prescribed way to a limited number of input conditions. For optimization purposes, we compute the synaptic weight vector that minimizes an arbitrary quadratic loss function. For ensemble modeling, we identify synaptic weight features that occur consistently across all solutions bounded by an arbitrary ellipsoid. We derive a common solution to this suite of nonlinear problems by showing how each of them reduces to an equivalent linear problem that can be solved analytically. Although identifying the equivalent linear problem is nontrivial, our tensor formalism provides an elegant geometrical perspective that allows us to solve the problem approximately in an analytical way or exactly using numeric methods. The final algorithm is applicable to a wide range of interesting neuroscience problems, and the associated geometric insights may carry over to other scientific problems that require constrained optimization.</description>

      <title>Modeling fibrous tissue in vascular fluid-structure interaction: a morphology-based pipeline and biomechanical significance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a suite of technologies for analyzing the interaction between anisotropic arterial walls and blood flow for subject-specific geometries. Utilizing an established lumen modeling strategy, we present a comprehensive pipeline for generating the thick-walled artery models. Through a specialized mesh generation procedure, we obtain the meshes for the arterial lumen and wall with mesh continuity across the interface ensured. Exploiting the centerline information, a series of procedures is introduced for generating local basis vectors within the arterial wall. The procedures are tailored to handle thick-walled and, in particular, aneurysmatic tissues in which the basis vectors may exhibit transmural variations. Additionally, we propose methods to accurately identify the centerline in multi-branched vessels and bifurcating regions. The developed fiber generation method is evaluated against the strategy using linear elastic analysis, demonstrating that the proposed approach yields satisfactory fiber definitions in the considered benchmark. Finally, we examine the impact of anisotropic arterial wall models on the vascular fluid-structure interaction analysis through numerical examples. For comparison purposes, the neo-Hookean model is considered. The first case involves an idealized curved geometry, while the second case studies an image-based abdominal aorta model. The numerical results reveal that the deformation and stress distribution are critically related to the constitutive model of the wall, while the hemodynamic factors are less sensitive to the wall model. This work paves the way for more accurate image-based vascular modeling and enhances the prediction of arterial behavior under physiologically realistic conditions.</description>
