      <title>A New Approach to the Construction of Subdivision Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, a new approach for constructing subdivision algorithms for generalized quadratic and cubic B-spline subdivision for subdivision surfaces and volumes is presented. First, a catalog of quality criteria for these subdivision algorithms is developed, serving as a guideline for the construction process.
  The construction begins by generating the desired subdominant eigenvectors as the vertices of regular convex 3-polytopes for volumes using circle packings. Subsequently, these polytopes are utilized to construct a Colin-de-Verdiere-matrix for the generalized quadratic and a Colin-de-Verdiere-like matrix for the generalized cubic B-spline subdivision. These matrices are then adjusted using the matrix exponential to obtain subdivision matrices with the desired properties.
  All subdivision algorithms introduced in this paper empirically exhibit a subdominant eigenvalue of 1/2 with the desired algebraic and geometric multiplicity. For the quadratic case, this property can even be formally proven. Moreover, the corresponding eigenvectors form a convex polytope in the central region for the generalized quadratic B-spline subdivision algorithms, while for the generalized cubic B-spline subdivision algorithms, they represent the refinement of a convex polytope. Additionally, the constructed subdivision algorithms fulfill various other quality criteria, such as affine invariance and convex hull preservation and respecting all symmetries. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the original Catmull-Clark algorithm is not suitable for generalization to volumetric subdivision and that the established subdivision algorithms [Baj+02] and [JM99] do not exhibit a suitable spectrum for several combinatorial configurations. Additionally, research approaches for the volumetric case are proposed, aiming to generalize from hexahedral to arbitrary structures.</description>

      <title>The number of regular simplices in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the extremal function $S^k_d(n)$, defined as the maximum number of regular $(k-1)$-simplices spanned by $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. For any fixed $d\geq2k\geq6$, we determine the asymptotic behavior of $S^k_d(n)$ up to a multiplicative constant in the lower-order term. In particular, when $k=3$, we determine the exact value of $S^3_d(n)$, for all even dimensions $d\geq6$ and sufficiently large $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s in a stronger form. The proof leverages techniques from hypergraph Tur\'an theory and linear algebra.</description>

      <title>General Strong Bound on the Uncrossed Number which is Tight for the Edge Crossing Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a very recent concept for visualizing various aspects of a graph in the plane using a collection of drawings introduced by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Masa\v{r}\'ik [GD 2023]. Formally, given a graph $G$, we aim to find an uncrossed collection containing drawings of $G$ in the plane such that each edge of $G$ is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection. The uncrossed number of $G$ ($unc(G)$) is the smallest integer $k$ such that an uncrossed collection for $G$ of size $k$ exists. The uncrossed number is lower-bounded by the well-known thickness, which is an edge-decomposition of $G$ into planar graphs. This connection gives a trivial lower-bound $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6}\rceil \le unc(G)$. In a recent paper, Balko, Hlin\v{e}n\'y, Masa\v{r}\'ik, Orthaber, Vogtenhuber, and Wagner [GD 2024] presented the first non-trivial and general lower-bound on the uncrossed number. We summarize it in terms of dense graphs (where $|E(G)|=\epsilon(|V(G)|)^2$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$): $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{c_\epsilon|V(G)|}\rceil \le unc(G)$, where $c_\epsilon\ge 2.82$ is a constant depending on $\epsilon$.
  We improve the lower-bound to state that $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6-\sqrt{2|E(G)|}+\sqrt{6(|V(G)|-2)}}\rceil \le unc(G)$. Translated to dense graphs regime, the bound yields a multiplicative constant $c'_\epsilon=3-\sqrt{(2-\epsilon)}$ in the expression $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{c'_\epsilon|V(G)|+o(|V(G)|)}\rceil \le unc(G)$. Hence, it is tight (up to low-order terms) for $\epsilon \approx \frac{1}{2}$ as warranted by complete graphs.
  In fact, we formulate our result in the language of the maximum uncrossed subgraph number, that is, the maximum number of edges of $G$ that are not crossed in a drawing of $G$ in the plane. In that case, we also provide a construction certifying that our bound is asymptotically tight (up to low-order terms) on dense graphs for all $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>
