      <title>Phase diagram of compressible and paired states in the quarter-filled Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hall plateaus at quarter fillings occur in GaAs wide quantum wells, hole-doped GaAs, and bilayer graphene. However, the interactions favoring incompressible states over compressible composite-Fermi liquids at such fillings are not well understood. We devise a method of computing the trial energies for Haldane pseudopotentials via Monte Carlo sampling. Applying it to the quarter-filled lowest Landau level, we find that tuning the third and fifth pseudopotential can stabilize anti-Pfaffian, Moore-Read, and f-wave states. The smallest deviations from pure Coulomb interactions are required by anti-Pfaffian, whose presence is indicated by daughter states in recent experiments of bilayer graphene at $\nu=\frac{3}{4}$.</description>

      <title>Geometric expansion of fluctuations and averaged shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this letter, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as averaged shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Flat-plane based double-counting free and parameter free many-body DFT+U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burgess et al. have recently introduced the BLOR corrective exchange-correlation functional that is, by construction, the unique simplified rotationally-invariant DFT+U functional that enforces the flat-plane condition separately on each effective orbital of a localized subspace. Detached from the Hubbard model, functionals of this type are both double-counting correction free and, when optimized in situ using appropriate error quantifiers, effectively parameter free. In this work, the extension of the BLOR functional to address many-body errors (mBLOR) is derived. The mBLOR functional is built to enforce the flat-plane condition on the entire subspace, rather than on each orbital individually. In this way inter-orbital errors are corrected on the same footing as the single-particle ones. Focusing on exact test cases with strong inter-orbital interactions, the BLOR and mBLOR functionals were benchmarked against contemporary DFT+U functionals using the total energy extensivity condition on stretched homo-nuclear p-block dimers that represent various self-interaction and static-correlation error regimes. The BLOR functional outperformed all other DFT+$U$ functionals tested, which often act to increase total-energy errors, yet it still yielded large errors in some systems. mBLOR instead yielded low energy errors across all four strongly-correlated dimers, while being constructed using only semi-local approximation ingredients. As mBLOR would not otherwise introduce a band-gap correction in the manner that is a desirable feature of DFT+U, we developed a cost-free technique to reintroduce it automatically by moving the functional's unusual explicit derivative discontinuity into the potential. With this in place, mBLOR is the only known DFT$+U$ functional that opens the bandgap of stretched neutral homo-nuclear dimers without the aid of unphysical spin-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>A topological Hund nodal line antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of topology, magnetism, and correlations gives rise to intriguing phases of matter. In this study, through state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we visualize a fourfold degenerate Dirac nodal line at the boundary of the bulk Brillouin zone in the antiferromagnet YMn2Ge2. We further demonstrate that this gapless, antiferromagnetic Dirac nodal line is enforced by the combination of magnetism, space-time inversion symmetry and nonsymmorphic lattice symmetry. The corresponding drumhead surface states traverse the whole surface Brillouin zone. YMn2Ge2 thus serves as a platform to exhibit the interplay of multiple degenerate nodal physics and antiferromagnetism. Interestingly, the magnetic nodal line displays a d-orbital dependent renormalization along its trajectory in momentum space, thereby manifesting Hund coupling. Our findings offer insights into the effect of electronic correlations on magnetic Dirac nodal lines, leading to an antiferromagnetic Hund nodal line.</description>

      <title>Growth of Ba_2CoWO_6 Single Crystals and their Magnetic, Thermodynamic and Electronic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the bulk crystal growth, structural characterization, and physical property measurements of the cubic double perovskite Ba_2CoWO_6(BCWO). In BCWO, Co+2 ions form a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice with non-distorted cobalt octahedra. The compound exhibits long-range antiferromagnetic order below TN = 14 K. Magnetization data indicated a slight anisotropy along with a spin-flop transition at 10 kOe , a saturation field of 310 kOe and an ordered moment of 2.17 Mu_B at T = 1.6 K. Heat capacity measurements indicate an effective j = 1/2 ground state configuration, resulting from the combined effects of the crystal electric field and spin-orbit interaction. Surface photovoltage analysis reveals two optical gaps in the UV-Visible region, suggesting potential applications in photocatalysis and photovoltaics. The magnetic and optical properties highlight the significant role of orbital contributions within BCWO, indicating various other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in the layered intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoNb$_4$Se$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are a new class of magnetic materials that combine the beneficial spintronics properties of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, garnering significant attention recently. Here, we have identified altermagnetism in a layered intercalated transition metal diselenide, CoNb$_4$Se$_8$, which crystallizes with an ordered sublattice of intercalated Co atoms between NbSe$_2$ layers. Single crystals are synthesized, and the structural characterizations are performed using single crystal diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. Magnetic measurements reveal easy-axis antiferromagnetism below 168 K. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that A-type antiferromagnetic ordering with easy-axis spin direction is the ground state, which is verified through single crystal neutron diffraction experiments. Electronic band structure calculations in this magnetic state display spin-split bands, confirming altermagnetism in this compound. The layered structure of CoNb$_4$Se$_8$ presents a promising platform for testing various predicted properties associated with altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Imaging of Fractional Spinon Quasiparticles in Open-Shell Triangulene Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of spinon quasiparticles, which carry spin but lack charge, is a hallmark of collective quantum phenomena in low-dimensional quantum spin systems. While the existence of spinons has been demonstrated through scattering spectroscopy in ensemble samples, real-space imaging of these quasiparticles within individual spin chains has remained elusive. In this study, we construct individual Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains using open-shell [2]triangulene molecules as building blocks. Each [2]triangulene unit, owing to its sublattice imbalance, hosts a net spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ in accordance with Lieb's theorem, and these spins are antiferromagnetically coupled within covalent chains with a coupling strength of $J = 45$ meV. Through scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we probe the spin states, excitation gaps, and their spatial excitation weights within covalent spin chains of varying lengths with atomic precision. Our investigation reveals that the excitation gap decreases as the chain length increases, extrapolating to zero for long chains, consistent with Haldane's gapless prediction. Moreover, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy reveals an m-shaped energy dispersion characteristic of confined spinon quasiparticles in a one-dimensional quantum box. These findings establish a promising strategy for exploring the unique properties of excitation quasiparticles and their broad implications for quantum information.</description>

      <title>Solving The Quantum Many-Body Hamiltonian Learning Problem with Neural Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and characterising quantum many-body dynamics remains a significant challenge due to both the exponential complexity required to represent quantum many-body Hamiltonians, and the need to accurately track states in time under the action of such Hamiltonians. This inherent complexity limits our ability to characterise quantum many-body systems, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to unlock their full potential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method to solve the Hamiltonian Learning (HL) problem-inferring quantum dynamics from many-body state trajectories-using Neural Differential Equations combined with an Ansatz Hamiltonian. Our method is reliably convergent, experimentally friendly, and interpretable, making it a stable solution for HL on a set of Hamiltonians previously unlearnable in the literature. In addition to this, we propose a new quantitative benchmark based on power laws, which can objectively compare the reliability and generalisation capabilities of any two HL algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our method against state-of-the-art HL algorithms with a 1D spin-1/2 chain proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electrical transport unveils Fermi surface malleability in a moir\'e heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities enhance many-body interactions and induce collective states of matter ranging from superconductivity to magnetism. In magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, van Hove singularities appear at low energies and are malleable with density, leading to a sequence of Lifshitz transitions and resets observable in Hall measurements. However, without a magnetic field, linear transport measurements have limited sensitivity to the band's topology. Here, we utilize nonlinear longitudinal and transverse transport measurements to probe these unique features in twisted bilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. We demonstrate that the nonlinear responses, induced by the Berry curvature dipole and extrinsic scattering processes, intricately map the Fermi surface reconstructions at various fillings. Importantly, our experiments highlight the intrinsic connection of these features with the moir\'e bands. Beyond corroborating the insights from linear Hall measurements, our findings establish nonlinear transport as a pivotal tool for probing band topology and correlated phenomena.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sine-Gordon quantum field theory at finite temperature by generalizing the method of random surfaces to compute the free energy and one-point functions of exponential operators non-perturbatively. Focusing on the gapped phase of the sine-Gordon model, we demonstrate the method's accuracy by comparing our results to the predictions of other methods and to exact results in the thermodynamic limit. We find excellent agreement between the method of random surfaces and other approaches when the temperature is not too small with respect to the mass gap. Extending the method to more general problems in strongly interacting one-dimensional quantum systems is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1407.4872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitonic density-wave states realized by the quantum condensation of electron-hole pairs (or excitons) are studied in the two-band Hubbard model with Hund's rule coupling and the pair hopping term. Using the variational cluster approximation, we calculate the grand potential of the system and demonstrate that Hund's rule coupling always stabilizes the excitonic spin-density-wave state and destabilizes the excitonic charge-density-wave state and that the pair hopping term enhances these effects. The characteristics of these excitonic density-wave states are discussed using the calculated single-particle spectral function, density of states, condensation amplitude, and pair coherence length. Implications of our results in the materials' aspects are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the insulating phases of the SU($N$)-generalization of the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model is investigated by means of non-perturbative approaches. By extending the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) argument to multi-component fermion systems with translation and global SU($N$) symmetries, we derive two indices which depend on the filling and the ``SU($N$)-spin'' (representation) of the local moments. These indices strongly constrain possible insulating phases; for instance, when the local moments transform in the $N$-dimensional (defining) representation of SU($N$), a featureless Kondo insulator is possible only at filling $f= 1-1/N$. To obtain further insight into the insulating phases suggested by the LSM argument, we derive low-energy effective theories by adding an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange interaction among the local moments [the SU($N$) Kondo-Heisenberg model]. A conjectured global phase diagram of the SU($N$) Kondo lattice model as a function of the filling and the Kondo coupling is then obtained by a combination of different analytical approaches.</description>

      <title>Cross Validation in Stochastic Analytic Continuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic Analytic Continuation (SAC) of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) imaginary-time correlation function data is a valuable tool in connecting many-body models to experimentally measurable dynamic response functions. Recent developments of the SAC method have allowed for spectral functions with sharp features, e.g. narrow peaks and divergent edges, to be resolved with unprecedented fidelity. Often times, it is not known what exact sharp features, if any, are present \textit{a priori}, and, due to the ill-posed nature of the analytic continuation problem, multiple spectral representations may be acceptable. In this work, we borrow from the machine learning and statistics literature and implement a cross validation technique to provide an unbiased method to identify the most likely spectrum amongst a set obtained with different spectral parameterizations and imposed constraints. We demonstrate the power of this method with examples using imaginary-time data generated by QMC simulations and synthetic data generated from artificial spectra. Our procedure, which can be considered a form of model selection, can be applied to a variety of numerical analytic continuation methods, beyond just SAC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected wave functions offer a means for incorporating local correlation effects in gapless electronic phases of matter like metals. Although such wave functions can be readily specified formally, it is challenging to compute their associated physical observables. Tensor network approaches offer a modern numerical method for this task. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a constructive tensor-network approach for obtaining physical quantities, like fermion two-point functions and density-density correlation functions, for one-dimensional projected Fermi sea states. We benchmark our method against exact analytical results for spin-1/2 electrons subjected to the Gutzwiller projection, and then present results on spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor repulsion. For a state with two pairs of Fermi points, we reveal a correlation-tuning of the characteristic wave vector of the charge density modulation in the system.</description>

It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of Composite Fermion Lambda Levels in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Composite fermion (CF) is a topological quasiparticle that emerges from a non-perturbative attachment of vortices to electrons in strongly correlated two-dimensional materials. Similar to non-interacting fermions that form Landau levels in a magnetic field, CFs can fill analogous ``Lambda'' levels, giving rise to the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect of electrons. Here, we show that Lambda levels can be directly visualized through the characteristic peak structure in the signal obtained via spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) on a FQH state. Complementary to transport, which probes low-energy properties of CFs, we show that \emph{high-energy} features in STM spectra can be interpreted in terms of Lambda levels. We numerically demonstrate that STM spectra can be accurately modeled using Jain's CF theory. Our results show that STM provides a powerful tool for revealing the anatomy of FQH states and identifying physics beyond the non-interacting CF paradigm.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the operator size concentration at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spin helices in the diluted one-dimensional $XX$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by discrepancies between recent cold atom experiments and the associated theory, we explore the effect of immobile holes on the quantum dynamics of $x$-$z$ spin helices in the one-dimensional $XX$ model. We calculate the exact spin dynamics by mapping onto a system of non-interacting fermions, averaging over the distribution of holes. At small hole densities we find that the helical spin pattern decays exponentially, with a pitch dependence that agrees with the experiments. At large hole densities we instead find persistent oscillations. While our analytic approach does not generalize to the $XXZ$ model with arbitrary anisotropies, we validate a matrix product state technique which might be used to model the experiments in those settings.</description>

      <title>Dipolar ordering transitions in many-body quantum optics: Analytical diagrammatic approach to equilibrium quantum spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin models with a large number of interaction partners per spin are frequently used to describe modern many-body quantum optical systems like arrays of Rydberg atoms, atom-cavity systems or trapped ion crystals. For theoretical analysis the mean-field (MF) ansatz is routinely applied. However, besides special cases of all-to-all or strong long range interactions, the MF ansatz provides only approximate results. Here we present a systematic correction to MF theory based on diagrammatic perturbation theory for quantum spin correlators in thermal equilibrium. Our analytic results are universally applicable for any lattice geometry and spin-length S. We provide pre-computed and easy-to-use building blocks for Ising, Heisenberg and transverse field Ising models in the symmetry-unbroken regime. We showcase the quality and simplicity of the method by computing magnetic phase boundaries and excitations gaps. We also treat the Dicke-Ising model of ground-state superradiance where we show that corrections to the MF phase boundary vanish.</description>

      <title>Integrals of Products of Bessel Functions: An Insight from the Physics of Bloch Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrals of products of Bessel functions exhibit an intriguing feature: under certain conditions on the parameters specifying the integrand, they vanish identically. We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the context of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a lattice ("Bloch electrons"), namely, in terms of their density of states and umklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of two colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives rise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this context, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that either the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside the band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an umklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being smaller than a critical value.</description>
