      <title>Pandora's Box Problem Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pandora's Box problem models the search for the best alternative when evaluation is costly. In its simplest variant, a decision maker is presented with $n$ boxes, each associated with a cost of inspection and a distribution over the reward hidden within. The decision maker inspects a subset of these boxes one after the other, in a possibly adaptive ordering, and obtains as utility the difference between the largest reward uncovered and the sum of the inspection costs. While this classic version of the problem is well understood (Weitzman 1979), recent years have seen a flourishing of the literature on variants of the problem. In this paper, we introduce a general framework -- the Pandora's Box Over Time problem -- that captures a wide range of variants where time plays a role, e.g., as it might constrain the schedules of exploration and influence both costs and rewards. In the Pandora's Box Over Time problem, each box is characterized by time-dependent rewards and costs, and inspecting it might require a box-specific processing time. Moreover, once a box is inspected, its reward may deteriorate over time, possibly differently for each box. Our main result is an efficient $21.3$-approximation to the optimal strategy, which is NP-hard to compute in general. We further obtain improved results for the natural special cases where boxes have no processing time, or when costs and reward distributions do not depend on time (but rewards may deteriorate after inspecting).</description>

      <title>Cryptoeconomics and Tokenomics as Economics: A Survey with Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper surveys products and studies on cryptoeconomics and tokenomics from an economic perspective, as these terms are still (i) ill-defined and (ii) disconnected from economic disciplines. We first suggest that they can be novel when integrated; we then conduct a literature review and case study following consensus-building for decentralization and token value for autonomy. Integration requires simultaneous consideration of strategic behavior, spamming, Sybil attacks, free-riding, marginal cost, marginal utility and stabilizers. This survey is the first systematization of knowledge on cryptoeconomics and tokenomics, aiming to bridge the contexts of economics and blockchain.</description>

      <title>Reputation-based Persuasion Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16694v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a two-stage Bayesian persuasion model in which a third-party platform controls the information available to the sender about users' preferences. We aim to characterize the optimal information disclosure policy of the platform, which maximizes average user utility, under the assumption that the sender also follows its own optimal policy. We show that this problem can be reduced to a model of market segmentation, in which probabilities are mapped into valuations. We then introduce a repeated variation of the persuasion platform problem in which myopic users arrive sequentially. In this setting, the platform controls the sender's information about users and maintains a reputation for the sender, punishing it if it fails to act truthfully on a certain subset of signals. We provide a characterization of the optimal platform policy in the reputation-based setting, which is then used to simplify the optimization problem of the platform.</description>

      <title>Smooth Nash Equilibria: Algorithms and Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental shortcoming of the concept of Nash equilibrium is its computational intractability: approximating Nash equilibria in normal-form games is PPAD-hard. In this paper, inspired by the ideas of smoothed analysis, we introduce a relaxed variant of Nash equilibrium called $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibrium, for a smoothness parameter $\sigma$. In a $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibrium, players only need to achieve utility at least as high as their best deviation to a $\sigma$-smooth strategy, which is a distribution that does not put too much mass (as parametrized by $\sigma$) on any fixed action. We distinguish two variants of $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria: strong $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria, in which players are required to play $\sigma$-smooth strategies under equilibrium play, and weak $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria, where there is no such requirement.
  We show that both weak and strong $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria have superior computational properties to Nash equilibria: when $\sigma$ as well as an approximation parameter $\epsilon$ and the number of players are all constants, there is a constant-time randomized algorithm to find a weak $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibrium in normal-form games. In the same parameter regime, there is a polynomial-time deterministic algorithm to find a strong $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibrium in a normal-form game. These results stand in contrast to the optimal algorithm for computing $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria, which cannot run in faster than quasipolynomial-time. We complement our upper bounds by showing that when either $\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is an inverse polynomial, finding a weak $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria becomes computationally intractable.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Computation in Multi-Stage Auctions and Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute equilibrium strategies in multi-stage games with continuous signal and action spaces as they are widely used in the management sciences and economics. Examples include sequential sales via auctions, multi-stage elimination contests, and Stackelberg competitions. In sequential auctions, analysts performing equilibrium analysis are required to derive not just single bids but bid functions for all possible signals or values that a bidder might have in multiple stages. Due to the continuity of the signal and action spaces, these bid functions come from an infinite dimensional space. While such models are fundamental to game theory and its applications, equilibrium strategies are rarely known. The resulting system of non-linear differential equations is considered intractable for all but elementary models. This has been limiting progress in game theory and is a barrier to its adoption in the field. We show that Deep Reinforcement Learning and self-play can learn equilibrium bidding strategies for various multi-stage games. We find equilibrium in models that have not yet been explored analytically and new asymmetric equilibrium bid functions for established models of sequential auctions. The verification of equilibrium is challenging in such games due to the continuous signal and action spaces. We introduce a verification algorithm and prove that the error of this verifier decreases when considering Lipschitz continuous strategies with increasing levels of discretization and sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Automated Deterministic Auction Design with Objective Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying high-revenue mechanisms that are both dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) and individually rational (IR) is a fundamental challenge in auction design. While theoretical approaches have encountered bottlenecks in multi-item auctions, there has been much empirical progress in automated designing such mechanisms using machine learning. However, existing research primarily focuses on randomized auctions, with less attention given to the more practical deterministic auctions. Therefore, this paper investigates the automated design of deterministic auctions and introduces OD-VVCA, an objective decomposition approach for automated designing Virtual Valuations Combinatorial Auctions (VVCAs). Firstly, we restrict our mechanism to deterministic VVCAs, which are inherently DSIC and IR. Afterward, we utilize a parallelizable dynamic programming algorithm to compute the allocation and revenue outcomes of a VVCA efficiently. We then decompose the revenue objective function into continuous and piecewise constant discontinuous components, optimizing each using distinct methods. Extensive experiments show that OD-VVCA achieves high revenue in multi-item auctions, especially in large-scale settings where it outperforms both randomized and deterministic baselines, indicating its efficacy and scalability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in the single-parameter mechanism design environment, the only non-wasteful, symmetric, incentive compatible and sybil-proof mechanism is a second price auction with symmetric tie-breaking. Thus, if there is private information, lotteries or other mechanisms that do not always allocate to a highest-value bidder are not sybil-proof or not incentive compatible.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing and Learning with Long-term Reference Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic pricing problem where customer response to the current price is impacted by the customer price expectation, aka reference price. We study a simple and novel reference price mechanism where reference price is the average of the past prices offered by the seller. As opposed to the more commonly studied exponential smoothing mechanism, in our reference price mechanism the prices offered by seller have a longer term effect on the future customer expectations.
  We show that under this mechanism, a markdown policy is near-optimal irrespective of the parameters of the model. This matches the common intuition that a seller may be better off by starting with a higher price and then decreasing it, as the customers feel like they are getting bargains on items that are ordinarily more expensive. For linear demand models, we also provide a detailed characterization of the near-optimal markdown policy along with an efficient way of computing it.
  We then consider a more challenging dynamic pricing and learning problem, where the demand model parameters are apriori unknown, and the seller needs to learn them online from the customers' responses to the offered prices while simultaneously optimizing revenue. The objective is to minimize regret, i.e., the $T$-round revenue loss compared to a clairvoyant optimal policy. This task essentially amounts to learning a non-stationary optimal policy in a time-variant Markov Decision Process (MDP). For linear demand models, we provide an efficient learning algorithm with an optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret upper bound.</description>

      <title>Optimal single threshold stopping rules and sharp prophet inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a finite horizon optimal stopping problem for a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. The objective is to design stopping rules that attempt to select the random variable with the highest value in the sequence. The performance of any stopping rule may be benchmarked relative to the selection of a "prophet" that has perfect foreknowledge of the largest value. Such comparisons are typically stated in the form of "prophet inequalities." In this paper we characterize sharp prophet inequalities for single threshold stopping rules as solutions to infinite two person zero sum games on the unit square with special payoff kernels. The proposed game theoretic characterization allows one to derive sharp non-asymptotic prophet inequalities for different classes of distributions. This, in turn, gives rise to a simple and computationally tractable algorithmic paradigm for deriving optimal single threshold stopping rules.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism for Optimizing Media Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mechanism is described that addresses the fundamental trade off between media producers who want to increase reach and consumers who provide attention based on the rate of utility received, and where overreach negatively impacts that rate. An optimal solution can be achieved when the media source considers the impact of overreach in a cost function used in determining the optimal distribution of content to maximize individual consumer utility and participation. The result is a Nash equilibrium between producer and consumer that is also Pareto efficient. Comparison with the literature on Recommender systems highlights the advantages of the mechanism, including identifying an optimal content volume for the consumer and improvements for optimizing with multiple objectives. A practical algorithm for generating the optimal distribution for each consumer is provided.</description>
