      <title>An Evaluation of External Magnetic Flux Error in Magnet-Moving Kibble balances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnet-moving measurement scheme in Kibble balances avoids displacing force-sensitive components, such as the weighing cell, and enables a broader magnetic profile measurement range during the velocity phase. However, this mechanism introduces the risk of asymmetry in the $Bl$ measurement due to external magnetic flux, leading to a potential systematic error in the final measurement results. Using the Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance magnet as a case study, this paper investigates the error mechanism through finite element analysis and experimental investigations. An evaluation method combining external weak-field measurements with attenuation factor analysis is proposed to assess external magnetic flux errors in magnet-moving measurement schemes. The findings demonstrate that selecting an optimal weighing position can reduce the far-end flux effect to the order of $10^{-9}$. In contrast, the near-end flux effect can be quantified by monitoring the magnetic field surrounding the magnet system. In the Tsinghua Kibble balance system, we show that with proper control of external flux sources, the relative error can be reduced below $1 \times 10^{-8}$ without requiring additional magnetic shielding.</description>

      <title>Simulating Gadolinium-Induced Magnetic Field Variations for Temperature Sensing with Magneto-Mechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-size magneto-mechanical resonators (MMR) represent an emerging class of passive, wireless sensors that combine a sensing functionality with a tracking option. The operation principle is based on a resonating rotor oscillation whose frequency is defined by the magnetic flux density of a stator magnet. One general sensing mechanism is the coupling of an external parameter to this resonator frequency. In this study, we investigate an approach for encoding a temperature information as a shift in the natural oscillation frequency utilizing the temperature-dependent magnetic properties of gadolinium (Gd). We perform an isolated simulation study on the temperature scaling of the magnetic field generation for stators coated with Gd of varying thickness. Our results show that the magnetic phase transition of Gd at its Curie temperature leads to a pronounced change in the magnetic permeability enabling a significant magnetic shielding behavior only for lower temperatures. In the transition regime, we find a peak sensitivity reaching 45.8 Hz/K exceeding existing values from the literature by up to a factor of $\sim$ 20. The findings of this work are an important step toward quantitative high-sensitivity temperature extraction with MMRs.</description>

      <title>Novel Application of Neutrinos to Evaluate U.S. Nuclear Weapons Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing realization that neutrinos can be used as a diagnostic tool to better understand the inner workings of a nuclear weapon. Robust estimates demonstrate that an Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) neutrino scintillation detector built at the Nevada Test Site of 1000-ton active target mass at a standoff distance of 500 m would detect thousands of neutrino events per kTe of nuclear yield. This would provide less than 4% statistical error on measured neutrino rate and 5% error on neutrino energy. Extrapolating this to an error on the test device explosive yield requires knowledge from evaluated nuclear databases, non-equilibrium fission rates, and assumptions on internal neutron fluxes. Initial calculations demonstrate that prompt neutrino rates from a short pulse of Pu-239 fission is about a factor of two less than that from a steady state assumption. As well, there are significant energy spectral differences as a function of time after the pulse that needs to be considered. In the absence of nuclear weapons testing, many of the technical and theoretical challenges of a full nuclear test could be mitigated with a low cost smaller scale 20 ton fiducial mass IBD demonstration detector placed near a TRIGA pulsed reactor. The short duty cycle and repeatability of pulses would provide critical real environment testing and the measured neutrino rate as a function of time data would provide unique constraints on fission databases and equilibrium assumptions.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold neutron simulation framework for the free neutron lifetime experiment $\tau$SPECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise determination of the free neutron lifetime is of great significance in modern precision physics. This key observable is linked to the mixing of up and down quarks via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, and the abundance of primordial elements after the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, the two leading measurement techniques for the neutron lifetime currently yield incompatible results, a discrepancy referred to as the neutron lifetime puzzle. To address the systematic uncertainties arising from neutron interactions with material walls, the $\tau$SPECT experiment employs a fully magnetic trap for ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs).
  UCNs are extremely low-energy neutrons with typical velocities below $8\,\textrm{m/s}$, which can be manipulated using magnetic fields, gravity, and suitable material guides, whose surface can reflect them at any angle of incidence. To precisely study and characterize UCN behavior during production, guidance, storage, and detection in $\tau$SPECT, we have developed a dedicated simulation framework. This framework is built upon the externally developed UCN Monte Carlo software package PENTrack and is enhanced with two companion tools: one for flexible and parametrizable upstream configuration of PENTrack such that the simulation's input settings can be adjusted to reproduce the experimental observations. The second package is used for analyzing, visualizing, and animating simulation data.
  The simulation results align well with experimental data obtained with $\tau$SPECT at the Paul Scherrer Institute and serve as a powerful resource for identifying systematic uncertainties and guiding future improvements to the current experimental setup.</description>

      <title>AMBER: Algorithm for Multiplexing spectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the art neutron spectrometers enable simultaneous measurements of high-dimensional datasets, allowing for a large collection rate of dynamic material properties. In this paper, we present the Algorithm for Multiplexing spectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence (AMBER), which is a segmentation algorithm designed to decompose measured neutron scattering data into model-agnostic foreground and background contributions. The method takes advantage of the fact that background and foreground signals are measured simultaneously during the data collection process, relying on rotational independence of background contributions. The algorithm, initially developed for multiplexing neutron spectrometers, aims to strongly reduce time consuming expert input, therefore promoting full data set usage while minimizing the source of systematic errors.</description>

      <title>A plug-and-play solution for characterizing two-way optical frequency transfer over free-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical clock networks connected by phase-coherent links offer significant potential for advancing fundamental research and diverse scientific applications. Free-space optical frequency transfer extends fiber-based connectivity to remote areas and holds the potential for global coverage via satellite links. Here we present a compact and robust portable, rack-integrated two-way free-space link characterization system. Equipped with plug-and-play capabilities, the system enables straightforward interfacing with various optical systems and facilitates quick deployment for field experiments. In this work, we achieve a fractional frequency instability of $2.0 \times 10^{-19}$ for an averaging time of 10 s over a 3.4 km horizontal fully folded intra-city free-space link. Moreover, the system maintains an uptime of $94\%$ over 15 hours, illustrating its reliability and effectiveness for high-precision optical frequency comparisons over free-space.</description>
