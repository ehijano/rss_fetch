      <title>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention to establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has proposed the entropic quantum gravity approach that proposes an action for gravity given by the quantum relative entropy between the metrics associated to a manifold. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the entropic quantum gravity action. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and open new avenues for establishing fundamental relations between brain research, machine learning and entropic quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Classes of non-Gaussian random matrices: long-range eigenvalue correlations and non-ergodic extended eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable universality of the eigenvalue correlation functions is perhaps one of the most salient findings in random matrix theory. Particularly for short-range separations of the eigenvalues, the correlation functions have been shown to be robust to many changes in the random matrix ensemble, and are often well-predicted by results corresponding to Gaussian random matrices in many applications. In this work, we show that, in contrast, the long-range correlations of the eigenvalues of random matrices are more sensitive. Using a path-integral approach, we identify classes of statistical deviations from the Gaussian Orthogonal random matrix Ensemble (GOE) that give rise to long-range correlations. We provide closed-form analytical expressions for the eigenvalue compressibility and two-point correlations, which ordinarily vanish for the GOE, but are non-zero here. These expressions are universal in the limit of small non-Gaussianity. We discuss how these results suggest the presence of non-ergodic eigenvectors, and we verify numerically that the eigenvector component distributions of a wide variety of non-Gaussian ensembles exhibit the associated power-law tails. We also comment on how these findings reveal the need to go beyond simple mean-field theories in disordered systems with non-Gaussian interactions.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency computational methodologies for electronic properties and structural characterization of Ge-Sb-Te based phase change materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical simulation to phase change materials such as Ge-Sb-Te has suffered from two methodology issues. On the one hand, there is a lack of efficient band gap correction method for density functional theory, which is suitable for these materials in both crystalline and amorphous phases, though the computational complexity should be kept at the local density approximation level. On the other hand, analysis of the coordination number in amorphous phases relies on an integration involving the radial distribution function, which adds to the complexity. In this work, we find that the shell DFT-1/2 method offers an overall band gap accuracy for phase change materials comparable to HSE06 hybrid functional, though its computational cost is around three orders of magnitude lower. Moreover, the mixed length-angle coordination number theory enables calculating the coordination numbers in the amorphous phase directly from the structure, with definite outcomes. The two methodologies could be helpful for high throughput simulation of phase change materials.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Local Integrability in Quantum Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting many-body quantum systems and their dynamics, while fundamental to modern science and technology, are formidable to simulate and understand. However, by discovering their symmetries, conservation laws, and integrability one can unravel their intricacies. Here, using up to 124 qubits of a fully programmable quantum computer, we uncover local conservation laws and integrability in one- and two-dimensional periodically-driven spin lattices in a regime previously inaccessible to such detailed analysis. We focus on the paradigmatic example of disorder-induced ergodicity breaking, where we first benchmark the system crossover into a localized regime through anomalies in the one-particle-density-matrix spectrum and other hallmark signatures. We then demonstrate that this regime stems from hidden local integrals of motion by faithfully reconstructing their quantum operators, thus providing a detailed portrait of the system's integrable dynamics. Our results demonstrate a versatile strategy for extracting the hidden dynamical structure from noisy experiments on large-scale quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of macroscopic dynamics by fine-grained disorder in many-species ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central feature of complex systems is the relevance and entanglement of different levels of description. For instance, the dynamics of ecosystems can be alternatively described in terms of large ecological processes and classes of organisms, or of individual species and their relations. Low-dimensional heuristic 'macroscopic' models that are widely used to capture ecological relationships -- and commonly evidence out-of equilibrium regimes -- implicitly assume that species-level 'microscopic' heterogeneity can be neglected. Here, we address the stability of such macroscopic descriptions to the addition of disordered microscopic interactions. We find that increased heterogeneity can stabilize collective as well as species fluctuations -- contrary to the well-known destabilizing effect of disorder on fixed points. We analytically find the conditions for the existence of heterogeneity-driven equilibria, and relate their stability to a mismatch in microscopic time scales. This may shed light onto the empirical observation that many-species ecosystems often appear stable at aggregated levels despite highly diverse interactions and large fluctuations at the species level.</description>

      <title>When Can You Get Away with Low Memory Adam?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adam is the go-to optimizer for training modern machine learning models, but it requires additional memory to maintain the moving averages of the gradients and their squares. While various low-memory optimizers have been proposed that sometimes match the performance of Adam, their lack of reliability has left Adam as the default choice. In this work, we apply a simple layer-wise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis to quantify when second-moment tensors can be effectively replaced by their means across different dimensions. Our SNR analysis reveals how architecture, training hyperparameters, and dataset properties impact compressibility along Adam's trajectory, naturally leading to $\textit{SlimAdam}$, a memory-efficient Adam variant. $\textit{SlimAdam}$ compresses the second moments along dimensions with high SNR when feasible, and leaves when compression would be detrimental. Through experiments across a diverse set of architectures and training scenarios, we show that $\textit{SlimAdam}$ matches Adam's performance and stability while saving up to $98\%$ of total second moments. Code for $\textit{SlimAdam}$ is available at https://github.com/dayal-kalra/low-memory-adam.</description>
