      <title>Closing the Implementation Gap in MC: Fully Chemical Synchronization and Detection for Cellular Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), nano-devices are envisioned to perform complex tasks collaboratively, i.e., by communicating with each other. One candidate for the implementation of such devices are engineered cells due to their inherent biocompatibility. However, because each engineered cell has only little computational capabilities, transmitter and receiver (RX) functionalities can afford only limited complexity. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet modular, architecture for a cellular RX that is capable of processing a stream of observed symbols using chemical reaction networks. Furthermore, we propose two specific detector implementations for the RX. The first detector is based on a machine learning model that is trained offline, i.e., before the cellular RX is deployed. The second detector utilizes pilot symbol-based training and is therefore able to continuously adapt to changing channel conditions online, i.e., after deployment. To coordinate the different chemical processing steps involved in symbol detection, the proposed cellular RX leverages an internal chemical timer. Furthermore, the RX is synchronized with the transmitter via external, i.e., extracellular, signals. Finally, the proposed architecture is validated using theoretical analysis and stochastic simulations. The presented results confirm the feasibility of both proposed implementations and reveal that the proposed online learning-based RX is able to perform reliable detection even in initially unknown or slowly changing channels. By its modular design and exclusively chemical implementation, the proposed RX contributes towards the realization of versatile and biocompatible nano-scale communication networks for IoBNT applications narrowing the existing implementation gap in cellular molecular communication (MC).</description>

      <title>UDON: A case for offloading to general purpose compute on CXL memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming CXL-based disaggregated memory devices feature special purpose units to offload compute to near-memory. In this paper, we explore opportunities for offloading compute to general purpose cores on CXL memory devices, thereby enabling a greater utility and diversity of offload.
  We study two classes of popular memory intensive applications: ML inference and vector database as candidates for computational offload. The study uses Arm AArch64-based dual-socket NUMA systems to emulate CXL type-2 devices.
  Our study shows promising results. With our ML inference model partitioning strategy for compute offload, we can place up to 90% data in remote memory with just 20% performance trade-off. Offloading Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) kernels in vector databases can provide upto 6.87$\times$ performance improvement with under 10% offload overhead.</description>

      <title>Virtual Sensor for Real-Time Bearing Load Prediction Using Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate bearing load monitoring is essential for their Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), enabling damage assessment, wear prediction, and proactive maintenance. While bearing sensors are typically placed on the bearing housing, direct load monitoring requires sensors inside the bearing itself. Recently introduced sensor rollers enable direct bearing load monitoring but are constrained by their battery life. Data-driven virtual sensors can learn from sensor roller data collected during a batterys lifetime to map operating conditions to bearing loads. Although spatially distributed bearing sensors offer insights into load distribution (e.g., correlating temperature with load), traditional machine learning algorithms struggle to fully exploit these spatial-temporal dependencies. To address this gap, we introduce a graph-based virtual sensor that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze spatial-temporal dependencies among sensor signals, mapping existing measurements (temperature, vibration) to bearing loads. Since temperature and vibration signals exhibit vastly different dynamics, we propose Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Networks (HTGNN), which explicitly models these signal types and their interactions for effective load prediction. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN outperforms Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which struggle to capture both spatial and heterogeneous signal characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of capturing the complex spatial interactions between temperature, vibration, and load.</description>

      <title>Spin-NeuroMem: A Low-Power Neuromorphic Associative Memory Design Based on Spintronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02463</link>

Abstract: Biologically-inspired computing models have made significant progress in recent years, but the conventional von Neumann architecture is inefficient for the large-scale matrix operations and massive parallelism required by these models. This paper presents Spin-NeuroMem, a low-power circuit design of Hopfield network for the function of associative memory. Spin-NeuroMem is equipped with energy-efficient spintronic synapses which utilize magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to store weight matrices of multiple associative memories. The proposed synapse design achieves as low as 17.4% power consumption compared to the state-of-the-art synapse designs. Spin-NeuroMem also encompasses a novel voltage converter with 60% less transistor usage for effective Hopfield network computation. In addition, we propose an associative memory simulator for the first time, which achieves a 5.05Mx speedup with a comparable associative memory effect. By harnessing the potential of spintronic devices, this work sheds light on the development of energy-efficient and scalable neuromorphic computing systems. The source code will be publicly available after the manuscript is reviewed.</description>

      <title>High-performance real-world optical computing trained by in situ model-free optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11957v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical computing systems provide high-speed and low-energy data processing but face deficiencies in computationally demanding training and simulation-to-reality gaps. We propose a gradient-based model-free optimization (G-MFO) method based on a Monte Carlo gradient estimation algorithm for computationally efficient in situ training of optical computing systems. This approach treats an optical computing system as a black box and back-propagates the loss directly to the optical computing weights' probability distributions, circumventing the need for a computationally heavy and biased system simulation. Our experiments on diffractive optical computing systems show that G-MFO outperforms hybrid training on the MNIST and FMNIST datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate image-free and high-speed classification of cells from their marker-free phase maps. Our method's model-free and high-performance nature, combined with its low demand for computational resources, paves the way for accelerating the transition of optical computing from laboratory demonstrations to practical, real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Computational Capabilities and Compiler Development for Neutral Atom Quantum Processors: Connecting Tool Developers and Hardware Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral Atom Quantum Computing (NAQC) emerges as a promising hardware platform primarily due to its long coherence times and scalability. Additionally, NAQC offers computational advantages encompassing potential long-range connectivity, native multi-qubit gate support, and the ability to physically rearrange qubits with high fidelity. However, for the successful operation of a NAQC processor, one additionally requires new software tools to translate high-level algorithmic descriptions into a hardware executable representation, taking maximal advantage of the hardware capabilities. Realizing new software tools requires a close connection between tool developers and hardware experts to ensure that the corresponding software tools obey the corresponding physical constraints. This work aims to provide a basis to establish this connection by investigating the broad spectrum of capabilities intrinsic to the NAQC platform and its implications on the compilation process. To this end, we first review the physical background of NAQC and derive how it affects the overall compilation process by formulating suitable constraints and figures of merit. We then provide a summary of the compilation process and discuss currently available software tools in this overview. Finally, we present selected case studies and employ the discussed figures of merit to evaluate the different capabilities of NAQC and compare them between two hardware setups.</description>
