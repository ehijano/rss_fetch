      <title>On Stable Univalence and Coefficient Estimates for a Class of Pluriharmonic Mappings in Convex Reinhardt Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of complex-valued pluriharmonic mappings defined over convex Reinhardt domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We first establish a multidimensional analogue of the Noshiro-Warschawski Theorem, providing sufficient conditions for the univalence of pluriharmonic mappings based on the real part of their partial derivatives. Furthermore, we introduce and study the class $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{H}_{n}^{0}}(M)$ of normalized pluriharmonic mappings, characterized by a specific bound on the sum of their second-order partial derivatives. We prove a one-to-one correspondence between this pluriharmonic class and a corresponding class of holomorphic functions, extending known results from the planar harmonic case to higher dimensions. Specifically, we show that a pluriharmonic mapping $f=h+\overline{g}$ is stable pluriharmonic univalent if and only if its holomorphic counterpart $F=h+g$ is stable holomorphic univalent on the unit polydisk $\mathbb{P}\Delta(0;1)$. Finally, we provide sharp coefficient estimates and sufficient conditions for functions to belong to the class $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{H}_{n}^{0}}(M)$. Our results generalize several classical theorems in the theory of univalent harmonic functions to the setting of several complex variables.</description>

      <title>Tessellations and Speiser graphs arising from meromorphic functions on simply connected Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by W. P. Thurston, we ask: What is the shape of a meromorphic function on a simply connected Riemann surface $\Omega_z$? We consider Speiser functions, i.e. meromorphic functions on a simply connected Riemann surface, that have a finite number $q$ at least 2 of singular (critical or asymptotic) values. As a first result, we make precise the correspondence between: Speiser functions $w(z)$, Speiser Riemann surfaces $R_w(z)$, Speiser $q$-tessellation, and analytic Speiser graphs of index $q$. As the second main result, we characterize tessellations with alternating colors (equivalently abstract pre-Speiser graphs) that are realized by Speiser functions on $\Omega_z$. The characterization is in terms of the $q$-regular extension problem of bipartite planar graphs. As third main results, the Speiser Riemann surface $R_w(z)$ can be constructed by isometric glueing of a finite number of types of sheets, where each sheet is a maximal domain of single-valuedness of the inverse of $w(z)$. Furthermore, a unique decomposition of $R_w(z)$ into maximal logarithmic towers and a soul is provided. Using vector fields we recognize that logarithmic towers come in two flavors: exponential or $h$-tangent blocks, directly related to the exponential or the hyperbolic tangent functions on the upper half plane. The surface $R_w(z)$ of a finite Speiser function is characterized by surgery of a rational block and a finite number of exponential or $h$-tangent blocks.</description>

      <title>Inequalities Concerning Rational Functions With Prescribed Poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Re_n$ be the set of all rational functions of the type $r(z) = p(z)/w(z),$ where $p(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$ and $w(z) = \prod_{j=1}^{n}(z-a_j)$, $|a_j|&gt;1$ for $1\leq j\leq n$. In this paper, we set up some results for rational functions with fixed poles and restricted zeros. The obtained results bring forth generalizations and refinements of some known inequalities for rational functions and in turn produce generalizations and refinements of some polynomial inequalities as well.</description>

      <title>Dunkl regularity over alternative $*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise slice-regularity of functions over a real alternative *-algebra using operators that arise in Dunkl operator theory. We present a unifying perspective on hypercomplex analysis by defining a family of function spaces in the kernel of Dunkl-Cauchy-Riemann operators. Each of these function spaces, whose elements are called Dunkl-regular functions, refines Dunkl monogenic function theory and Dunkl harmonic analysis on Euclidean spaces. This approach allows a wide variety of hypercomplex function theories to be embedded as subcases of Dunkl monogenic function theory. This paves the way for further interactions between Dunkl theory and hypercomplex analysis.</description>

      <title>Embedding theorems and integration operators on Hardy--Carleson type tent spaces induced by doubling weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the function and operator theory of Hardy--Carleson--type analytic tent spaces $AT_q^\infty(\omega)$ induced by radial weights $\omega$ satisfying a two-sided doubling condition. We first characterize the positive Borel measures $\mu$ for which the embedding from $AT_p^\infty(\omega)$ into the tent space $T_q^\infty(\mu)$ is bounded for all $0 &lt; p, q &lt; \infty$. A Littlewood--Paley formula for $AT_q^\infty(\omega)$ is then established. Using these results, we give a complete characterization of the boundedness (compactness) of Volterra-type integration operators between $AT_p^\infty(\omega)$ and $AT_q^\infty(\omega)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we characterize the compact orbifolds, quotients $ X = \mathcal{D}/ \Gamma$ of a bounded symmetric domain $\mathcal{D}$ with no higher dimensional ball factor by the action of a discontinuous group $\Gamma$, as those projective orbifolds with ample orbifold canonical divisor which admit a Mok curvature type tensor of orbifold type and satisfying certain other conditions implying the existence of a finite smooth covering.</description>

      <title>The theorem of Maehara-Severi for maps of general type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a finiteness result for dominant rational maps whose orbifold base is of general type. Our finiteness result generalizes Maehara's theorem that a given variety dominates only finitely many projective varieties of general type up to birational equivalence, and also answers a question of Campana on the finiteness of Bogomolov sheaves. We give several further applications, including finiteness results for maps to curves, abelian varieties, and K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Schauder Basis with Finite Blaschke Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Schauder basis for the space $Hol(\mathbb D)$, the space of holomorphic functions on the closed unit disk, consisting entirely of finite Blaschke products. The expansion coefficients are given explicitly. Our result remains valid when $Hol(\mathbb D)$ is equipped with a broader class of norms satisfying natural structural conditions. These conditions are satisfied by norms of classical function spaces such as the Hardy spaces $H^p$ ($1\leq p\leq \infty$), the weighted Bergman spaces $A_\alpha^p$ ($1\leq p\leq \infty$, $\alpha&gt;-1$), and BMOA. We also establish the optimality of this framework by proving that such a basis cannot exist in larger spaces, such as the Hardy space $H^p$ and the disc algebra $A(\mathbb D)$.</description>

      <title>Formal structure of scalar curvature in generalized K\"ahler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on works of Boulanger and Goto, we show that Goto's scalar curvature is the moment map for an action of generalized Hamiltonian automorphisms of the associated Courant algebroid, constrained by the choice of an adapted volume form. We derive an explicit formula for Goto's scalar curvature, and show that it is constant for generalized K\"ahler-Ricci solitons. Restricting to the generically symplectic type case, we realize the generalized K\"ahler class as the complexified orbit of the Hamiltonian action above. This leads to a natural extension of Mabuchi's metric and $K$-energy, implying a conditional uniqueness result. Finally, in this setting we derive a Calabi-Matsushima-Lichnerowicz obstruction and a Futaki invariant.</description>

      <title>Log Baum--Bott Residues for foliations by curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Baum--Bott type residual formula for one-dimensional holomorphic foliations, and logarithmic along free divisors. More precisely, this provides a Baum--Bott theorem for a foliated triple $(X, \mathcal{F}, D)$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a foliation by curves and $D$ is a free divisor on a complex manifold $X$. From the local point of view, we show that the log Baum--Bott residues are a generalization of the Aleksandrov logarithmic index for vector fields with isolated singularities on hypersurfaces. We also show how these new indices are related to Poincar\'e's Problem for foliations by curves. In the case of foliated surfaces, we show that the differences between the logarithmic residues and Baum--Bott indices along invariant curves can be expressed in terms of the GSV and Camacho--Sad indices. We also obtain a Baum--Bott type formula for singular varieties via log resolutions. Finally, we prove a weak global version of the Zariski--Lipman conjecture for compact algebraic surfaces, in the form of a foliated smoothness criterion, suggesting the appearance of saddle-nodes in the singularity reduction on singular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic $\bf{\partial\bar\partial}$-lemma and several geometric applications (with an Appendix joint with Sheng Rao)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a $\partial\bar{\partial}$-type lemma on compact K\"ahler manifolds for logarithmic differential forms valued in the dual of a certain pseudo-effective line bundle, thereby confirming a conjecture proposed by X. Wan.
  We then derive several applications, including strengthened results by H. Esnault-E. Viehweg on the degeneracy of the spectral sequence at the $E_1$-stage for projective manifolds associated with the logarithmic de Rham complex, as well as by L. Katzarkov-M. Kontsevich-T. Pantev on the unobstructed locally trivial deformations of a projective generalized log Calabi-Yau pair with some weights, both of which are extended to the broader context of compact K\"ahler manifolds.
  Furthermore, we establish the K\"ahler version of an injectivity theorem originally formulated by F. Ambro in the algebraic setting. Notably, while O. Fujino previously addressed the K\"ahler case, our proof takes a different approach by avoiding the reliance on mixed Hodge structures for cohomology with compact support.</description>
