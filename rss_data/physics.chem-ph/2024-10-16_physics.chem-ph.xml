      <title>Benchmarking Data Efficiency in $\Delta$-ML and Multifidelity Models for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of machine learning (ML) methods has made quantum chemistry (QC) calculations more accessible by reducing the compute cost incurred in conventional QC methods. This has since been translated into the overhead cost of generating training data. Increased work in reducing the cost of generating training data resulted in the development of $\Delta$-ML and multifidelity machine learning methods which use data at more than one QC level of accuracy, or fidelity. This work compares the data costs associated with $\Delta$-ML, multifidelity machine learning (MFML), and optimized MFML (o-MFML) in contrast with a newly introduced Multifidelity$\Delta$-Machine Learning (MF$\Delta$ML) method for the prediction of ground state energies over the multifidelity benchmark dataset QeMFi. This assessment is made on the basis of training data generation cost associated with each model and is compared with the single fidelity kernel ridge regression (KRR) case. The results indicate that the use of multifidelity methods surpasses the standard $\Delta$-ML approaches in cases of a large number of predictions. For cases, where $\Delta$-ML method might be favored, such as small test set regimes, the MF$\Delta$-ML method is shown to be more efficient than conventional $\Delta$-ML.</description>

      <title>Investigating Data Hierarchies in Multifidelity Machine Learning for Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in machine learning (ML) has made high-accuracy quantum chemistry (QC) calculations more accessible. Of particular interest are multifidelity machine learning (MFML) methods where training data from differing accuracies or fidelities are used. These methods usually employ a fixed scaling factor, $\gamma$, to relate the number of training samples across different fidelities, which reflects the cost and assumed sparsity of the data. This study investigates the impact of modifying $\gamma$ on model efficiency and accuracy for the prediction of vertical excitation energies using the QeMFi benchmark dataset. Further, this work introduces QC compute time informed scaling factors, denoted as $\theta$, that vary based on QC compute times at different fidelities. A novel error metric, error contours of MFML, is proposed to provide a comprehensive view of model error contributions from each fidelity. The results indicate that high model accuracy can be achieved with just 2 training samples at the target fidelity when a larger number of samples from lower fidelities are used. This is further illustrated through a novel concept, the $\Gamma$-curve, which compares model error against the time-cost of generating training samples, demonstrating that multifidelity models can achieve high accuracy while minimizing training data costs.</description>

      <title>Excited State Properties from the Bethe--Salpeter Equation: State-to-State Transitions and Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism to calculate excited state properties from the $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) method is introduced, providing convenient access to excited state absorption, excited state circular dichroism, and excited state optical rotation in the framework of the $GW$-BSE method. This is achieved using the second-order transition density, which can be obtained by solving a set of auxiliary equations similar to time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The proposed formulation therefore leads to no increase in the formal computational complexity when compared to the corresponding ground state properties. We further outline the calculation of fully relaxed spin-orbit coupling matrix elements within the $GW$-BSE method, allowing us to include perturbative corrections for spin-orbit coupling in aforementioned properties. These corrections are also extended to TD-DFT. Excited state absorption and perturbative spin-orbit coupling corrections within $GW$-BSE are evaluated for a selected set of molecular systems, yielding promising results.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study on the dynamics and spectroscopy of collective rovibrational polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate rovibrational molecular models are employed to gain insight in high-resolution into the collective effects and intermolecular processes arising when molecules in the gas phase are interacting with a resonant infrared (IR) radiation mode. An efficient theoretical approach is detailed and numerical results are presented for the HCl and H$_2$O molecules confined in an IR cavity. It is shown that by employing a rotationally resolved model for the molecules, revealing the various cavity-mediated interactions between the field-free molecular eigenstates, it is possible to obtain a detailed understanding of the physical processes governing the energy level structure, absorbtion spectra, and dynamic behavior of the confined systems. Collective effects, arising due the cavity-mediated interaction between molecules, are identified in energy level shifts, in intensity borrowing effects in the absorbtion spectra, and in the intermolecular energy transfer occuring during Hermitian or non-Hermitian time propagation.</description>

      <title>Effective Hamiltonians from Spin Adapted Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalised extraction procedure for magnetic interactions using effective Hamiltonians applicable to systems with more than two sites featuring local spins $S_i \geq 1$ is presented. To this end, closed, non-recursive expressions pertaining to chains of arbitrary equal spins are derived with the graphical method of angular momentum. The method is illustrated by extracting magnetic couplings from ab initio calculations on a [CaMn$_3^{(\text{IV})}$O$_4$] cubane. An extension to non-sequential coupling schemes is shown to be conducive to expressing additional symmetries of certain spin Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Theory of vibronic adsorbate-surface Fano resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent visible pump - infrared probe spectra reported for molecular catalysts adsorbed to quantum dots, we introduce a theory of non-equilibrium vibronic Fano resonances arising from the interference of quantum dot excited-state intraband transitions and infrared vibrational excitations of a molecular adsorbate. Our theory suggests a superexchange mechanism for the observed Fano resonances where charge-transfer states mediate the effective interaction between molecular vibrations and near-resonance quantum dot intraband transitions. We present a perturbative treatment of the effective adsorbate-quantum dot vibronic interaction and employ it to construct a two-reservoir Fano model that enables us to capture key experimental trends, including the relationship between the Fano asymmetry factor, quantum dot size, and the distance between the molecular adsorbate and the quantum dot. We focus on adsorbate-quantum dot species, but our theory's implications are shown to be generic for molecules adsorbed to materials with resonant strong mid-infrared electronic transitions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Polariton Dynamics in a Multimode Cavity: Noise-enhanced Ballistic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in optical measurements enable precise tracking of cavity polariton dynamics with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Building on these developments, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of wave packet dynamics in a noisy emitter lattice embedded in a multi-mode microcavity. We uncover a series of dynamic phenomena in both the noise-free and noisy cases: (i) In the noise-free case, the emitters' probability density splits into two Gaussians whose group velocities are defined by the lower and upper polariton branches. (ii) Noise induces dephasing and leads to multiple dynamical stages with different time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. These stages include, in order of increasing duration: underdamped Rabi oscillations; damping of the center of mass velocity of the emitters' probability density; population thermalization; and the transition from the ballistic to the diffusive regimes of the probability density spreading. (iii) Most strikingly, dephasing enhances the ballistic spreading, which persists for several orders of magnitude longer than it does without a cavity. Some of our predictions align with recent experimental observations, while others can be tested in existing platforms. Understanding wave packet dynamics across multiple time scales in the presence of noise is crucial for optimizing polaritonic devices. This study paves the way for future experiments focused on light-matter interactions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Towards chemical accuracy for chemi- and physisorption with an efficient density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding molecular adsorption on surfaces underpins many problems in chemistry and materials science. Accurately and efficiently describing the adsorption has been a challenging task for first-principles methods as the process can involve both short-range chemical bond formations and long-range physical interactions, e.g., the van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Density functional theory presents an appealing choice for modeling adsorption reactions, though calculations with many exchange correlation density functional approximations struggle to accurately describe both chemical and physical molecular adsorptions. Here, we propose an efficient density functional approximation that is accurate for both chemical and physical adsorption by concurrently optimizing its semilocal component and the long-range vdW correction against the prototypical adsorption CO/Pt(111) and Ar$_2$ binding energy curve. The resulting functional opens the door to accurate and efficient modeling of general molecular adsorption.</description>

      <title>Change in Magnetic Order in NiPS3 Single Crystals Induced by a Molecular Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intercalation is a robust method for tuning the physical properties of a vast number of van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, the prospects of using intercalation to modify magnetism in vdWs systems and the associated mechanisms have not been investigated adequately. In this work, we modulate magnetic order in an XY antiferromagnet NiPS3 single crystals by introducing pyridine molecules into the vdWs gap under different thermal conditions. X-ray diffraction measurements indicated pronounced changes in the lattice parameter beta, while magnetization measurements at in-plane and out-of-plane configurations exposed reversal trends in the crystals Neel temperatures through intercalation-de-intercalation processes. The changes in magnetic ordering were also supported by three-dimensional thermal diffusivity experiments. The preferred orientation of the pyridine dipoles within vdW gaps was deciphered via polarized Raman spectroscopy. The results highlight the relation between the preferential alignment of the intercalants, thermal transport, and crystallographic disorder along with the modulation of anisotropy in the magnetic order. The theoretical concept of double-exchange interaction in NiPS3 was employed to explain the intercalation-induced magnetic ordering. The study uncovers the merit of intercalation as a foundation for spin switches and spin transistors in advanced quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics (MD), systems are molecules made up of    atoms, and the aim is to determine their evolution over time.  MD    is based on a numerical resolution algorithm, whose role is to    apply the forces generated by the various components, according to    the equations of Newtonian physics. Molecular Dynamics is    currently mainly used in materials science and molecular biology.  In this document, we limit ourselves to {\it alkanes} which are  non-cyclic carbon-hydrogenated chains. In the basic ``All-atom''  (AA) scale, all the atoms are directly simulated. In the  ``United-atom'' (UA) scale, one considers grains that are composed  of a carbon atom with the hydrogen atoms attached to it. Grains in  the ``Coarse-grained'' (CG) scale are composed of two consecutive UA  grains. In the multi-scale approach, one tries to use as much as  possible the UA and CG scales which can be more efficiently  simulated than the AA scale.  In this document, we mainly put the focus on three topics.  First, we describe an MD system, implemented in the Java  programming language, according to the Synchronous Reactive  Programming approach in which there exists a notion of a global  logical time.  This system is used to simulate molecules and also to  build the potentials functions at the UA and CG scales.  Second, two methods to derive UA and CG potentials from AA  potentials are proposed and analysed. Basically, both methods rely  on strong geometrical links with the AA scale. We use these links  with AA to determine the forms and values of the UA and CG  potentials.  In the first method (called ``inverse-Boltzmann''), one  considers data produced during several AA scale molecule  simulations, and one processes these data using a statistical  approach. In the second method (``minimisation method''), one  applies a constrained-minimisation technique to AA molecules. The  most satisfactory method clearly appears to be the  minimisation-based one.  The UA potentials we have determined have  standard forms: they only differ from AA potentials by parameter  values. On the opposite, CG potentials are non-standard  functions. We show how to implement them with functions defined ``by  cases''.  Finally, we consider ``reconstructions'' which are means to  dynamically change molecule scales during simulations.  In  particular, we consider automatic reconstructions based on the  proximity of molecules.</description>

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in high repetition-rate extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light sources and photoelectron analyzers have led to dramatic advances in the performance of time-resolved photoemission experiments. In this perspective article, we discuss the application of cavity-enhanced high-order harmonic generation (CE-HHG), with repetition rates exceeding 10 MHz, to photoemission experiments using advanced endstations incorporating time-of-flight photoelectron analyzers. We discuss recent results, perspective on future areas for further technological improvement, and the wide array of science enabled by ultrafast XUV photoemission experiments, now in a qualitatively new regime.</description>

      <title>Multiple scales homogenisation of a porous viscoelastic material with rigid inclusions: application to lithium-ion battery electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the mechanical behaviour of the composite materials used in modern lithium-ion battery electrodes. These contain relatively high modulus active particle inclusions within a two-component matrix of liquid electrolyte which penetrates the pore space within a viscoelastic polymer binder. Deformations are driven by a combination of (i) swelling/contraction of the electrode particles in response to lithium insertion/extraction, (ii) swelling of the binder as it absorbs electrolyte, (iii) external loading and (iv) flow of the electrolyte within the pores. We derive the macroscale response of the composite using systematic multiple scales homomgenisation by exploiting the disparity in lengthscales associated with the size of an electrode particle and the electrode as a whole. The resulting effective model accurately replicates the behaviour of the original model (as is demonstrated by a series of relevant case studies) but, crucially, is markedly {simpler and hence} cheaper to solve. This is significant practical value because it facilitates low-cost, realistic computations of the mechanical states of battery electrodes, thereby allowing model-assisted development of battery designs that are better able to withstand the mechanical abuse encountered in practice and ultimately paving the way for longer-lasting batteries.</description>

      <title>Molecular Quantum Control Algorithm Design by Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of polyatomic molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in a single, pure quantum state. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated in the case of a CaH$^+$ ion, with up to 96 thermally populated eigenstates and under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. We expect that the method developed, with physics-informed learning, will be directly implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>

      <title>Does basis set superposition error significantly affect post-CCSD(T) corrections?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the title question for both a subset of the W4-11 total atomization energies benchmark, and for the A24x8 noncovalent interactions benchmark. Overall, counterpoise corrections to post-CCSD(T) contributions are about two orders of magnitude less important than those to the CCSD(T) interaction energy. Counterpoise corrections for connected quadruple substitutions (Q) are negligible, and $(Q)_\Lambda - (Q)$ or $T_4 - (Q)$ especially so. In contrast, for atomization energies, the $T_3-(T)$ counterpoise correction can reach about 0.05 \kcalmol~for small basis sets like cc-pVDZ, thought it rapidly tapers off with cc-pVTZ and especially aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. It is reduced to insignificance by the extrapolation of $T_3-(T)$ applied in both W4 and HEAT thermochemistry protocols. In noncovalent dimers, the differential BSSE on post-CCSD(T) correlation contributions is negligible even in basis sets as small as the unpolarized split-valence cc-pVDZ(no d).</description>

      <title>Operating a Multi-Level Molecular Dimer Switch through Precise Tip-Molecule Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling structural transitions between molecular configurations is crucial for advancing functional molecular electronics. While reversible switching of bistable two-state molecules has been achieved, creating molecular systems that can be controllably switched between multiple configurations often requires complex synthetic methods, presenting a much greater challenge. In this study, we showcase a straightforward yet effective strategy to create and control transitions between multiple molecular structural states by forming a surface-bound molecular dimer. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we induce and characterize the structural transitions of a pyrrolidine dimer on a Cu(100) surface. The intermolecular interactions open new energy transfer channels, enabling the excitation through pathways that were inaccessible in monomers. The occupation of different molecular states is highly sensitive to both the energy of the tunneling electrons and the interaction with the STM tip. By precisely adjusting the tip-molecule distance, we can select the most probable structural configuration based on sample bias, thereby achieving on-demand control of this molecular dimer switch. This work highlights an approach that leverages both intermolecular and molecule-environment interactions to create and control an artificially fabricated molecular device.</description>

      <title>Double Configuration Interaction Singles: Scalable and size-intensive approach for orbital relaxation in excited states and bond-dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical scheme for orbital optimization in configuration interaction singles (CIS) based on a perturbative treatment of its electronic Hessian, whose analytical derivation is also established in this work. The proposed method, which can be interpreted as a "CIS-then-CIS" scheme, variationally accounts for orbital relaxation in excited states, thus significantly reducing the overestimation of charge-transfer excitation energies commonly associated with standard CIS. Additionally, by incorporating de-excitation effects from CIS, we demonstrate that our approach effectively describes single bond dissociation. Notably, all these improvements are achieved at a mean-field cost, with the pre-factor further reduced with the efficient algorithm introduced here, while preserving the size-intensive property of CIS.</description>

      <title>A Framework of SO(3)-equivariant Non-linear Representation Learning and its Application to Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose both a theoretical and a methodological framework to address a critical challenge in applying deep learning to physical systems: the reconciliation of non-linear expressiveness with SO(3)-equivariance in predictions of SO(3)-equivariant quantities. Inspired by covariant theory in physics, we present a solution by exploring the mathematical relationships between SO(3)-invariant and SO(3)-equivariant quantities and their representations. We first construct theoretical SO(3)-invariant quantities derived from the SO(3)-equivariant regression targets, and use these invariant quantities as supervisory labels to guide the learning of high-quality SO(3)-invariant features. Given that SO(3)-invariance is preserved under non-linear operations, the encoding process for invariant features can extensively utilize non-linear mappings, thereby fully capturing the non-linear patterns inherent in physical systems. Building on this, we propose a gradient-based mechanism to induce SO(3)-equivariant encodings of various degrees from the learned SO(3)-invariant features. This mechanism can incorporate non-linear expressive capabilities into SO(3)-equivariant representations, while theoretically preserving their equivariant properties as we prove, establishing a strong foundation for regressing complex SO(3)-equivariant targets. We apply our theory and method to the electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction tasks, experimental results on eight benchmark databases covering multiple types of systems and challenging scenarios show substantial improvements on the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy of deep learning paradigm. Our method boosts Hamiltonian prediction accuracy by up to 40% and enhances downstream physical quantities, such as occupied orbital energy, by a maximum of 76%.</description>

      <title>Majorana Tensor Decomposition: A unifying framework for decompositions of fermionic Hamiltonians to Linear Combination of Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) decompositions have appeared as one of the main tools for encoding operators on quantum computers, allowing efficient implementations of arbitrary operators. In particular, LCU approaches present a way of encoding information from the electronic structure Hamiltonian into a quantum circuit. Over the past years, many different decomposition techniques have appeared for the electronic structure Hamiltonian. Here we present the Majorana Tensor Decomposition (MTD), a framework that unifies existing LCUs and offers novel decomposition methods by using popular low-rank tensor factorizations.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>
