      <title>A Simple and Computationally Trivial Estimator for Grouped Fixed Effects Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.08879v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new fixed effects estimator for linear panel data models with clustered time patterns of unobserved heterogeneity. The method avoids non-convex and combinatorial optimization by combining a preliminary consistent estimator of the slope coefficient, an agglomerative pairwise-differencing clustering of cross-sectional units, and a pooled ordinary least squares regression. Asymptotic guarantees are established in a framework where $T$ can grow at any power of $N$, as both $N$ and $T$ approach infinity. Unlike most existing approaches, the proposed estimator is computationally straightforward and does not require a known upper bound on the number of groups. As existing approaches, this method leads to a consistent estimation of well-separated groups and an estimator of common parameters asymptotically equivalent to the infeasible regression controlling for the true groups. An application revisits the statistical association between income and democracy.</description>

      <title>The general solution to an autoregressive law of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete description of the set of all solutions to an autoregressive law of motion in a finite-dimensional complex vector space. Every solution is shown to be the sum of three parts, each corresponding to a directed flow of time. One part flows forward from the arbitrarily distant past; one flows backward from the arbitrarily distant future; and one flows outward from time zero. The three parts are obtained by applying three complementary spectral projections to the solution, these corresponding to a separation of the eigenvalues of the autoregressive operator according to whether they are inside, outside or on the unit circle. We provide a finite-dimensional parametrization of the set of all solutions.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Estimation of Large Probit Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probit models are useful for modeling correlated discrete responses in many disciplines, including consumer choice data in economics and marketing. However, the Gaussian latent variable feature of probit models coupled with identification constraints pose significant computational challenges for its estimation and inference, especially when the dimension of the discrete response variable is large. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating large probit models. Our work is distinct from existing methods in two important aspects. First, instead of simulation or sampling methods, we apply and customize expectation propagation (EP), a deterministic method originally proposed for approximate Bayesian inference, to estimate moments of the truncated multivariate normal (TMVN) in the E (expectation) step. Second, we take advantage of a symmetric identification condition to transform the constrained optimization problem in the M (maximization) step into a one-dimensional problem, which is solved efficiently using Newton's method instead of off-the-shelf solvers. Our method enables the analysis of correlated choice data in the presence of more than 100 alternatives, which is a reasonable size in modern applications, such as online shopping and booking platforms, but has been difficult in practice with probit models. We apply our probit estimation method to study ordering effects in hotel search results on Expedia's online booking platform.</description>
