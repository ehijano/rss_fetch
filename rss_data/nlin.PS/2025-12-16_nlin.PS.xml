      <title>Perturbation of Traveling Boussinesq Solitons by Periodic Bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the perturbations induced by a periodic bathymetry on traveling Boussinesq solitons in a two-dimensional configuration. We present two perturbation approaches to solve the nonlinear, dispersive and non-autonomous differential equations of the model and compare the solutions with numerical simulations of the original system of equations. In the approximation for small periodic corrugations we built the solutions as modulated traveling waves using Fourier series. The coefficients of the series are solved using the Green function method and the pathordered exponential method. At the second order in the relative height of bed corrugations, we obtain the perturbation as the fourth-order linear dispersive waves generated by the modulated traveling soliton in its wake. In the second approach, we rewrite the Boussinesq system into a perturbed Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) nonlinear equation, and obtain the corresponding perturbed solitons. These analytic solutions are compared with the results of numerical simulations, for various parameters that characterize the effects of nonlinearity, dispersion, and bottom bathymetry. We also discuss the stability of the perturbed solitons in time. The perturbation approaches developed in this study are valid for any type of periodic bathymetries, and the method can readily be extended to non-periodic ones.</description>

      <title>Some Novel Aspects of the Plane Pendulum in Classical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a novel connection between the exact solutions of the plane pendulum, hyperbolic plane pendulum and inverted plane pendulum equations as well as the static solutions of the sine-Gordon and the sine hyperbolic-Gordon equations and obtain a few exact solutions of the above mentioned equations. Besides, we consider the plane pendulum equation in the first anharmonic approximation and obtain its large number of exact periodic as well as hyperbolic solutions.In addition, we obtain two exact solutions of the plane pendulum equation in the second anharmonic approximation. Further, we introduce an elliptic plane pendulum equation in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions $-{\rm sn}(\theta,m)/{\rm dn}(\theta,m)$ which smoothly goes over to the the plane pendulum equation in the $m=0$ limit and the hyperbolic plane pendulum equation in the $m = 1$ limit where $m$ is the modulus of the Jacobi elliptic functions. We show that in the harmonic approximation, the elliptic pendulum problem represents a one-parameter family of isochronous system. Further, for the special case of $m = 1/2$, we show that one has an isochronous system even in the first anharmonic approximation. Finally, we also briefly discuss the hyperbolic plane pendulum and obtain a few of its exact solutions in the harmonic as well as the first anharmonic approximation.</description>

      <title>Model for self-organized Leidenfrost rotating polygons as cnoidal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable appearance of self-organized regular and peaked polygonal rotating patterns in shallow Leidenfrost rings is investigated as a balance between surface tension geometry and nonlinear terms of Euler equation. Using the Boussinesq shallow convection approximation and a specialized expansion of the Laplace equation solutions, we derive a nonlinear equation that can be integrated in terms of elliptic functions. The model rigorously accounts for surface tension, the contribution of the poloidal rolling vortex, and the interplay between buoyancy-driven and thermocapillary flows. We obtain cnoidal waves solutions describing the dynamics of the inner free surface of the Leidenfrost ring, to predict polygonal patterns in liquid nitrogen. These predictions are compared with experimental observations.Additionally, we introduce a simplified model based on poloidal averaging of the capillary pressure, leading to a Korteweg-de Vries-type equation. This simplified model not only reproduces the cnoidal wave solutions but also predicts new trigonometric solutions, offering insights into the formation of peaked polygons.</description>

      <title>Linear Superposition of Quadratic Functions in a Fifth Order KdV-Type Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a fifth order KdV-type equation admits several real as well as complex parity-time reversal or PT-invariant solutions with linear superposition of quadratic functions involving Jacobi elliptic functions of the form ${\rm dn}^2(x,m)$, ${\rm cn}(x,m){\rm dn}(x,m)$, ${\rm sn}(x,m) {\rm cn}(x,m)$ and ${\rm sn}(x,m){\rm dn}(x,m)$. These results must be contrasted with only partial superposition of such functions in Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), $\phi^3$ and a few other nonlinear equations.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability for traveling waves of fourth order semilinear wave and Schrodinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and spectral stability of traveling wave solutions for a class of fourth-order semilinear wave equations, commonly referred to as beam equations. Using variational methods based on a constrained maximization problem, we establish the existence of smooth, exponentially decaying traveling wave profiles for wavespeeds in the interval $(0, \sqrt{2})$. We derive precise spectral properties of the associated linearized operators and prove a Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) type stability criterion that completely characterizes spectral stability. Furthermore, we determine the sharp exponential decay rate of the traveling waves and demonstrate that it matches the decay rate of the Green's function for the linearized operator. Our analysis extends to fourth-order nonlinear Schrodinger equations, for which we establish analogous existence and stability results. The theoretical findings are complemented by numerical computations that verify the stability predictions and reveal the transition from unstable to stable regimes as the wavespeed varies. These results provide a comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding wave propagation phenomena in structural mechanics, particularly suspension bridge models.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation Beyond Turing: Physical Principles of Mass-Conserving Reaction--Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracellular protein patterns govern essential cellular functions by dynamically redistributing proteins between membrane-bound and cytosolic states, conserving their total numbers. This review presents a theoretical framework for understanding such patterns based on mass-conserving reaction--diffusion systems. The emergence, selection, and evolution of patterns are analyzed in terms of mass redistribution and interface motion, resulting in mesoscale laws of coarsening and wavelength selection. A geometric phase-space perspective provides a conceptual tool to link local reactive equilibria with global pattern dynamics through conserved mass fluxes. The Min protein system of \emph{Escherichia coli} provides a paradigmatic example, enabling direct comparison between theory and experiment. Successive model refinements capture both the robustness of pattern formation and the diversity of dynamic regimes observed \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in vitro}. The Min system thus illustrates how to extract predictive, multiscale theory from biochemical detail, providing a foundation for understanding pattern formation in more complex and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Bimodal Amplitude Patterns in Heterogeneous Oscillatory Media -- Experiment and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an intricate mechanism of pattern formation in globally coupled heterogeneous oscillatory media. In anodic electrochemical etching of silicon, the electrode surface splits into two amplitude-phase regions, while all oscillators remain frequency-locked. Additionally, the relative ratio of the pattern can be tuned via a coupling term. We introduce a heterogeneous, complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with global coupling to reproduce these patterns and study their formation. Neglecting diffusion shows that frequency entrainment arises from amplitude adaptation. Diffusion, on the other hand, enforces the selection of a unique cluster ratio. In quantitative agreement with simulations, a center-manifold reduction yields a Lyapunov functional that predicts the selected ratio. Both of these results establish a theoretical framework that connects experiment and theory. Moreover, they show how heterogeneity and diffusion convert degenerate cluster dynamics into robust pattern selection.</description>

      <title>Contact-Geometric Description of Dissipative Nonlinear Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a contact-geometric framework for dissipative field theories with two main theorems: a Least Constraint Theorem for complex fields and a theorem linking contact geometry to probability measures. Applying this to the 2D Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation (CGLE), we derive its dissipative contact dynamics, resulting in a Contact Hamilton-Jacobi (CHJ) equation. The theory yields exact travelling-wave solutions and shows a continuous parametric transition from periodic cnoidal waves to localised solitons. Importantly, the geometric probability functional reveals a first-order statistical phase transition, marked by a sharp switch and hysteresis in the probability landscape. Geometrically, probability results from projecting high-dimensional contact information onto the configuration space, where the statistical weight is encoded in the action functional. While demonstrated for CGLE, the principles provide a fundamental framework for analysing pattern selection and phase transitions in nonlinear dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of entanglement in a cold atom analog of cosmological preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe entanglement between collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a configuration analogous to particle production during the preheating phase of the early universe. In our setup, the oscillation of the inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which reveals the role played by vacuum fluctuations in seeding the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features. These point towards future experimental probes of the late-time nonlinear regime where further analogies can be drawn with reheating, i.e. the thermalization of the post-inflationary Universe.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of additive and parametric pinning control protocols for systems of weakly coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of nonlinear systems on networks is a paramount task in control theory, in particular the control of synchronization, given its vast applicability. In this work, we focus on pinning control and we examine two different approaches: the first, more common in engineering applications, where the control is implemented through an external input (additive pinning); the other, where the parameters of the pinned nodes are varied (parametric pinning). By means of the phase reduction technique, we show that the two pinning approaches are equivalent for weakly coupled systems exhibiting periodic oscillatory behaviors. Through numerical simulations, we validate the claim for a system of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators. Our results pave the way for further applications of pinning control in real-world systems.</description>
