      <title>Computation of Characteristic Mode for Regional Structure of Interconnected Metal Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for calculating substructure characteristic modes require treating interconnected metal structures as a single entity to ensure current continuity between different metal bodies. However, when these structures are treated as separate entities, existing methods exhibit inaccuracies, affecting the assessment of structural performance. To address this challenge, we propose an enhanced electromagnetic model that enables accurate characteristic mode analysis for regional structures within interconnected metal bodies. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the proposed method, and an antenna design example demonstrates its practical utility.</description>

      <title>Particle image velocimetry and modelling of horizontal coherent liquid jets impinging on and draining down a vertical wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow patterns created by a coherent horizontal liquid jet impinging on a vertical wall atmoderate flow rates (jet flowrates 0.5-4.0 L min-1, jet velocities 2.6-21 m s-1) are studied withwater on glass, polypropylene and polymethylmethacrylate (acrylic, Perspex(R)) using a novelparticle image velicometry (PIV) technique employing nearly opaque fluid doped withartificial pearlescence to track surface velocity. Flow patterns similar to those reported inprevious studies are observed on each substrate: their dimensions differed owing to theinfluence of wall material on contact angle. The dimensions are compared with models for (i)the radial flow zone, reported by Wang et al. (2013b), and the part of the draining film belowthe jet impingement point where it narrows to a node. For (ii), the model presented by Mertenset al. (2005) is revised to include a simpler assumed draining film shape and an alternativeboundary condition accounting for surface tension effects acting at the film edge. This refinedmodel gives equally good or better fits to the experimental data. The effective contact anglewhich gives good agreement with the data is found to lie between the measured quasi-staticadvancing and receding contact angles, at approximately half the advancing value. The PIVmeasurements confirmed the existence of a thin fast moving film with radial flow surroundingthe point of impingement, and a wide draining film bounded by ropes of liquid below theimpingement point. While these measurements generally support the predictions of existingmodels, these models assume that the flow is steady. In contrast, surface waves were evident inboth regions and this partly explains the difference between the measured surface velocity andthe values estimated from the models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetries of supersymmetric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04747v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the dynamical symmetries of classical supersymmetric oscillators in one and two spatial (bosonic) dimensions. Our main ingredient is a generalized Poisson bracket which is defined as a suitable classical counterpart to commutators and anticommutators. In one dimension, i.e., in the presence of one bosonic and one fermionic coordinate, the Hamiltonian admits a $U(1,1)$ symmetry for which we explicitly compute the first integrals. It is found that suitable forms of the supercharges emerge in a natural way as fermionic conserved quantities. Following this, we describe classical supercharge operators based on the generalized Poisson bracket and subsequently define supersymmetry transformations. We perform a straightforward generalization to two spatial dimensions where the Hamiltonian has an overall $U(2,2)$ symmetry. We comment on plausible supersymmetric generalizations of the Pais-Uhlenbeck and isotonic oscillators, and also present the possibility of defining a generalized Nambu bracket within the classical formalism.</description>
