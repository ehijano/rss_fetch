      <title>Bass modules and embeddings into free modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the free module of infinite rank $R^{(\kappa)}$ purely embeds every $\kappa$-generated flat left $R$-module iff $R$ is left perfect. Using a Bass module corresponding to a descending chain of principal right ideals, we construct a model of the theory $T$ of $R^{(\kappa)}$ whose projectivity is equivalent to left perfectness, which allows to add a `stronger' equivalent condition: $R^{(\kappa)}$ purely embeds every $\kappa$-generated flat left $R$-module which is a model of $T$.
  We extend the model-theoretic construction of this Bass module to arbitrary descending chains of pp formulas, resulting in a `Bass theory' of pure-projective modules. We put this new theory to use by, among other things, reproving an old result of Daniel Simson about pure-semisimple rings and Mittag-Leffler modules.
  This paper is a condensed version, solely about modules, of our larger work arXiv:2407.15864, with two new results added about cyclically presented modules (Cor.14) and finitely presented cyclic modules (Rem.15).</description>

      <title>Characterization of subfields of adelic algebras by a product formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider projective, irreducible, non-singular curves over an algebraically closed field $\k$. A cover $Y \to X$ of such curves corresponds to an extension $\Omega/\Sigma$ of their function fields and yields an isomorphism $\A_{Y} \simeq \A_{X} \otimes_{\Sigma} \Omega$ of their geometric adele rings. The primitive element theorem shows that $\A_{Y}$ is a quotient of $\A_{X}[T]$ by a polynomial.
  In general, we may look at quotient algebras $\AXp{\p} = \A_{X}[T]/(\p(T))$ where $\p(T) \in \A_{X}[T]$ is monic and separable over $\A_{X}$, and try to characterize the field extensions $\Omega/\Sigma$ lying in $\AXp{\p}$ which arise from covers as above. We achieve this topologically, namely, as those $\Omega$ which embed discretely in $\AXp{\p}$, and in terms of an additive analog of the product formula for global fields, a result which is reminiscent of classical work of Artin-Whaples and Iwasawa.
  The technical machinery requires studying which topology on $\AXp{\p}$ is natural for this problem. Local compactness no longer holds, but instead we have linear topologies defined by commensurability of $\k$-subspaces which coincide with the restricted direct product topology with respect to integral closures. The content function is given as an index measuring the discrepancy in commensurable subspaces.</description>

      <title>Cyclic covers of an algebraic curve from an adelic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algebraic method for the classification of branched Galois covers of a curve $X$ focused on studying Galois ring extensions of its geometric adele ring $\A_{X}$. As an application, we deal with cyclic covers; namely, we determine when a given cyclic ring extension of $\A_{X}$ comes from a corresponding cover of curves $Y \to X$, which is reminiscent of a Grunwald-Wang problem, and also determine when two covers yield isomorphic ring extensions, which is known in the literature as an equivalence problem. This completely algebraic method permits us to recover ramification, certain analytic data such as rotation numbers, and enumeration formulas for covers.</description>

      <title>Skew Hecke Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, $H \le G$ a subgroup, $R$ a commutative ring, $A$ an $R$-algebra, and $\alpha$ an action of $G$ on $A$ by $R$-algebra automorphisms. We study the associated \emph{skew Hecke algebra} $\mathcal{H}_{R}(G,H,A,\alpha)$, which is the convolution algebra of $H$-invariant functions from $G/H$ to $A$.
  We prove for skew Hecke algebras a number of common generalisations of results about skew group algebras and results about Hecke algebras of finite groups. We show that skew Hecke algebras admit a certain double coset decomposition. We construct an isomorphism from $\mathcal{H}_{R}(G,H,A,\alpha)$ to the algebra of $G$-invariants in the tensor product $A \otimes \mathrm{End}_{R} ( \mathrm{Ind}_{H}^{G} R )$. We show that if $|H|$ is a unit in $A$, then $\mathcal{H}_{R}(G,H,A,\alpha)$ is isomorphic to a corner ring inside the skew group algebra $A \rtimes G$.
  Alongside our main results, we show that the construction of skew Hecke algebras is compatible with certain group-theoretic operations, restriction and extension of scalars, certain cocycle perturbations of the action, gradings and filtrations, and the formation of opposite algebras. The main results are illustrated in the case where $G = S_3$, $H = S_2$, and $\alpha$ is the natural permutation action of $S_3$ on the polynomial algebra $R[x_1,x_2,x_3]$.</description>

      <title>Inductive description of quadratic Hom-Lie algebras with twist maps in the centroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we give an inductive way to construct quadratic Hom-Lie algebras with twist maps in the centroid. We focus on those Hom-Lie algebras which are not Lie algebras. We prove that a Hom-Lie algebra of this type has trivial center and its twist map is nilpotent. We show that there exists a maximal ideal containing the kernel and the image of the twist map. Then we state an inductive way to construct this type of Hom-Lie algebras, similar to the double extension procedure for Lie algebras, and prove that any indecomposable quadratic Hom-Lie algebra with nilpotent twist map in the centroid, which is not a Lie algebra, can be constructed using this type of double extension.</description>

      <title>Linear complementary pairs of skew constacyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear complementary pairs (LCPs) of codes have been studied since they were introduced in the context of discussing mitigation measures against possible hardware attacks to integrated circuits. In this situation, the security parameters for LCPs of codes are defined as the (Hamming) distance and the dual distance of the codes in the pair. We study the properties of LCPs of skew constacyclic codes, since their algebraic structure provides tools for studying their duals and their distances. As a result, we give a characterization for those pairs, as well as multiple results that lead to constructing pairs with designed security parameters. We extend skew BCH codes to a constacyclic context and show that an LCP of codes can be immediately constructed from a skew BCH constacyclic code. Additionally, we describe a Hamming weight-preserving automorphism group in the set of skew constacyclic codes, which can be used for constructing LCPs of codes.</description>

      <title>Tilting theory for extended module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In extended hearts of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated category, we provide a Happel-Reiten-Smalo tilting theorem and a characterization for $s$-torsion pairs. Applying these to $m$-extended module categories, we characterize torsion pairs induced by $(m+1)$-term silting complexes. After establishing Auslander-Reiten theory in extended module categories, we introduce $\tau_{[m]}$-tilting pairs and show bijections between $\tau_{[m]}$-tilting pairs, $(m+1)$-term silting complexes, and functorially finite $s$-torsion pairs.</description>

      <title>Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, Maximum Deconstructibility, and torsion classes generated by groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconstructibility is an often-used sufficient condition on a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules that allows one to carry out homological algebra \emph{relative to $\mathcal{C}$}. The principle \textbf{Maximum Deconstructibility (MD)} asserts that a certain necessary condition for a class to be deconstructible is also sufficient. MD implies, for example, that the classes of Gorenstein Projective modules, Ding Projective modules, their relativized variants, and all torsion classes are deconstructible over any ring. MD was known to follow from Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and imply the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. We prove that MD is equivalent to Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, and to the assertion that each torsion class of abelian groups is generated by a single group within the class (yielding the converse of a theorem of G\"obel and Shelah).</description>
