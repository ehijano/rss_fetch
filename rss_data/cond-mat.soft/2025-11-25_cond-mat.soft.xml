      <title>Fracture and failure of shear-jammed dense suspensions under impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impacted with sufficiently large stress, a dense, initially liquid-like suspension can be forced into a solid-like state through the process of shear jamming. While the onset of shear jamming has been investigated extensively, less is known about the resulting solid-like state in the high stress limit and its failure. We experimentally produce such high-stress failure by impacting dense suspensions at a controlled speed. Using cornstarch suspensions we vary impact speed over several orders of magnitude and change fluid viscosity and surface tension in order to identify the conditions for failure. The results are compared with dense suspensions of potato starch or silica particles. In the case of fracture, we observe two types of cracks: a primary circular crack around the impactor followed by secondary radial cracks. Mapping out the onset of radial fracturing for different volume fractions and impact speeds, we identify the requirements for failure via crack formation to occur with at least 50% likelihood. We find that this likelihood is not sensitive to changes in particle diameter, but increases when the solvent's viscosity or surface tension are reduced. In the state diagram for dense suspensions we delineate the upper limit of shear-jammed rigidity and the crossover into a fracture regime at large volume fraction and normal stress, several orders of magnitude above the onset stress for shear-jamming. We find that the onset of fracturing in many cases is correlated with internal ductile deformation of the shear-jammed material underneath the impactor, observable in normal stress as a function of axial strain. For small suspension volumes and large impact speeds, we find strain-hardening up until fracturing. This more brittle behavior results in a modulus that, just before crack formation, is an order of magnitude larger than in shear-jammed suspensions undergoing ductile deformation.</description>

      <title>Artificial life of an active droplets system: a quantitative lifecycle analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of synthetic active matter systems holds the promise for designing smart materials and devices with emergent characteristics akin to those of living organisms, eventually opening the doors to the realization of artificial life. Such an investigation, however, is challenged by the difficulty inherent in identifying the relationship between the features of the elementary constituents and the emergent properties of the whole; to this end, a key step consists in the accurate quantification of the system's observed behavior. Here, we report the study of 50 self-propelled oil droplets floating on the surface of an aqueous solution. 25 droplets are stained with a red dye, and the other 25 are stained blue: the colorants affect the droplets' interfacial tension properties differently, consequently influencing their collective dynamics. Droplet trajectories extending for up to 5 hours are extracted from video recordings with a tracking pipeline developed ad hoc. The structural and dynamical analysis of the system reveals a ``life-to-death'' cycle unfolding in qualitatively distinct stages, showcasing a complex interplay between individual droplet mobility and collective organization. The tools developed and the results obtained in our work pave the way to the in silico modelling as well as the experimental design of synthetic active matter systems displaying life-like and programmable behavior.</description>

      <title>Structural Relaxation and Anisotropic Elasticity of Ordered Block Copolymer Melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block copolymer (BCP) melts play a critical role in the design of thermoplastics, owing in large part to the creation of alternating nano-scale domains of soft and stiff components. Much of thermoplastic design has been focused on the short-time response associated with the dynamical rigidity of rubbery or glassy chains. However, less attention has been paid to the long-time relaxation and rigidity of microphase separated BCP melts or the role that domain morphology plays in modulating near-equilibrium response. We take advantage of the ability of self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to calculate equilibrium properties of BCP melts to explore the anisotropic elastic response of ordered ABA and AB copolymer melts as quasistatic deformation processes. This allows us to determine the anisotropic stiffness of the liquid crystal-like lamellar and columnar phases due to modulations in domain spacing, as well as the full stiffness tensor of the cubic BCC sphere and double gyroid phases. We explore elastic modulus landscapes for both single grain materials and random polycrystals over architectural parameters and segregation strengths, using AB diblock and ABA triblock melts as key examples. Finally, we re-examine basic assumptions of BCP melts as simple composites, dependence of melt stiffness on domain spacing, and the role of bridging chain conformations in altering melt relaxation, providing evidence for an interplay between mass transport and domain topology that remains to be understood.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Slowdown and Spatial Correlations in Viscous Silica Melt: Perspectives from Dynamic Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic slowdown in glass-forming liquids remains a central topic in condensed matter science. Here, we report a theoretical investigation of the microscopic origin of the slowdown in amorphous silica, a prototypical strong glass former with a tetrahedral network structure. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze atomic jump dynamics, the elementary structural change processes underlying relaxation. We find that the jump statistics deviate from Poisson behavior with decreasing temperature, reflecting the emergence of dynamic disorder in which slowly evolving variables modulate the jump motion. The slowdown is species-dependent: for silicon, the primary constraint arises from the fourth-nearest oxygen neighbor, while at lower temperatures, the fourth-nearest silicon also becomes relevant; for oxygen, the dominant influence comes from the second-nearest silicon neighbors. As the system is cooled, the jump dynamics become increasingly slow and intermittent, proceeding in a higher-dimensional space of multiple slow variables that reflect cooperative rearrangements of the network. Species-resolved point-to-set correlations further reveal that the spatial extent of cooperative relaxation grows differently for silicon and oxygen, directly linking their relaxation asymmetry to the extent of collective motion. Together, these results provide a microscopic framework linking dynamic disorder, species-dependent constraints, and cooperative correlations, offering deeper insight into the slowdown of strong glass-forming networks.</description>

      <title>Deformation and organization of droplet-encapsulated soft beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological, culinary, and engineering processes lead to the co-encapsulation of several soft particles within a liquid interface. In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum.</description>

      <title>Active motility and wetting cooperatively regulate liquid-liquid phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation of aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) is fundamental across physical and biological sciences. While well understood for passive systems, how this process is regulated by active agents such as motile bacteria remains largely unexplored. By combining experiments on Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a prototypical dextran-polyethylene glycol ATPS with hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the interplay between bacterial activity and interfacial wetting gives rise to a robust sequence of nonequilibrium morphologies, including self-spinning droplets, elongated droplet chains, branched capillary-like clusters, and highly deformed droplets. We find that activity plays a dual role in coarsening kinetics: it suppresses coarsening through hydrodynamically driven, activity-induced droplet rotation, yet accelerates it when dextran is the minority phase, where wetting-mediated attraction governs bacterial aggregation. These findings reveal a generic physical mechanism through which motility and wetting cooperatively control phase-separation dynamics, offering new physical insight into activity-regulated LLPS and suggesting strategies for engineering ATPS morphology using active agents.</description>

      <title>Scale-Rich Network-Based Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials, at their essence, are networks defined by homogeneity: uniform bonds, fixed thicknesses, and discrete length scales. Mechanical metamaterials, while representing structurally more diverse microstructures, remain defined by the homogeneity of their unit cells, pore sizes, or repeating features. In contrast, as network science has revealed, real-world and biological systems -- from the Internet to the brain -- derive their function from broad, multiscale variability in connectivity and link length. Here, we introduce Scale-Rich (SR) metamaterials, a design framework that embeds network heterogeneity into mechanical metamaterials, achieving order-of-magnitude heterogeneity in ligament lengths, thicknesses, and connectivity. Governed by only two parameters, SR networks span orders of magnitude in structural features, overcoming prior constraints in metamaterial design. Translating these network models into physically realizable materials, we use simulations and experiments to show that SR metamaterials exhibit properties inaccessible to traditional single-scale systems, including highly tunable elastic anisotropy, delocalized nonlinear deformation with high energy absorption, and programmable acoustic wave control. This network-science-based paradigm establishes a minimal yet universal framework for engineering multifunctional materials whose mechanical and acoustic behavior emerge directly from scale diversity itself.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Framework for Glassy Polymer Viscoelasticity Across 20 Frequency Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glassy polymers are central to engineering applications, yet their viscoelastic response over broad frequency and temperature ranges remains difficult to characterize. We extend non-affine deformation theory by incorporating a time-dependent memory kernel within the Generalized Langevin Equation for atomistic non-affine motions, yielding frequency-dependent mechanical response. Applied to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), the method captures the shear modulus and relaxation spectrum across more than twenty decades in frequency, from hundreds of terahertz down to the millihertz regime, thus bridging polymer mechanics from ordinary to extreme scales. Our predictions show quantitative consistency with independent estimates from oscillatory-shear molecular dynamics, Brillouin scattering, ultrasonic spectroscopy, Split-Hopkinson testing, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), demonstrating a unified theoretical-computational route for multiscale characterization of polymer glasses.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of flat-foldable thick origami with smooth curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami as a deployable structure offers the unique advantage of achieving compact stowage via flat-folding while forming a well-defined surface composed of rigid panels upon deployment. However, since origami consists of flat facets, it is inherently limited in forming smooth curved surfaces upon deployment. This limitation restricts its applicability in systems where smooth curved geometries are essential for performance, such as aerospace systems and electromagnetic communication devices. Herein, we propose an inverse design methodology for thick origami that is capable of flat-folding while forming a smooth curved outer surface upon deployment. By establishing flat-foldable constraints that specify the positions of the creases, our method constructs thick origami capable of flat-folding even with panels that include a curved facet. Furthermore, by representing the origami layout as a graph, we enumerate all possible origami configurations and enable flexible design of the internal structure. Analytical results show that the optimized packaging ratio increases as the number of cells in a layout increases, indicating that the proposed design methodology provides controllability over the packaging ratio through the number of cells. Using our proposed design methodology, we fabricated a deployable origami wing and demonstrated its functionality through successful flight testing, in which the wing was subjected to aerodynamic loads. Our work proposes a new strategy for packaging smooth curved surfaces, addressing the packaging challenges encountered in aerospace and electromagnetic communications and thereby providing greater design freedom.</description>

      <title>Emergence of oscillatory states of self-propelled colloids under optical confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate experimentally the single-particle motion in water of silica colloidal beads half-coated with carbon under the action of a converging laser beam. The beads are self-propelled in this medium by means of self-thermophoresis resulting from local heating as a result of light absorption by their carbon cap. Within a certain laser power range, we find that these particles exhibit a quasi-two-dimensional active motion near a solid surface with stochastic rotational reversals when propelling themselves away from the region of maximum intensity, which leads to a stable trapping with oscillatory-like behavior inside the illuminated region. The orientation autocorrelation function of this type of confined active motion displays damped oscillations whose characteristic frequency increases with increasing propulsion speed, thus resulting in four regimes of translational motion depending on the observation time scale: thermal diffusion, ballistic motion, oscillatory behavior, and confinement. Our experimental findings are well described by a minimal phenomenological model that includes the nonlinear effect of a torque that reorients the particle toward the center of the optical confinement, which in combination with rotational diffusion gives rise to the observed orientational changes that allow their oscillatory trapping inside the light field. We also show that a similar active trapping mechanism emerges in the case of Janus colloidal rods, even though the periodicity is hindered by their three-dimensional rotation in the laser beam.</description>

      <title>Structure factor's realizability reveals the glass-dynamics onset temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When cooling liquids quickly enough, they bypass crystallization and instead enter a supercooled state and then a glass state. Previous studies have shown that the static structure factors of high-temperature liquids, supercooled liquids, and glasses exhibit only subtle differences, leading to the conclusion that the glass transition cannot be predicted solely from structure factor changes. Our research challenges this view. Specifically, we studied the difficulty of generating configurations corresponding to target structure factors using stochastic gradient descent optimizations. While such optimizations easily converge when targeting the structure factors of higher-temperature liquids, the difficulty significantly increases for lower temperature liquids and glasses. By quantifying this difficulty through the mean squared error achieved, we found a non-differentiable point at the onset temperature of glass dynamics. Our results suggest that the onset of glass dynamics can be explained by a fundamental change in the structure factor's realizability, even though the structure factor itself only changes slightly. Our results are currently based on computer simulations using original and modified Dzugutov interactions, and future work will determine whether our theory is applicable to other glass-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the contact between rough viscoelastic solids after decreasing loads: memory erasure and monotonic increase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real area of contact governs, in part, the friction coefficient, yet its time evolution in rough viscoelastic interfaces remains incompletely understood. In experiments of contact between polymethylmethacrylate blocks under decreasing normal loads, Dillavou and Rubinstein have shown that the true contact area exhibits, after unloading, a decreasing phase and long-term memory of the contact state prior to unloading. It is however unclear what modeling ingredients are necessary to reproduce these two features. Here, we investigate these effects using fractional viscoelastic rough contact models. By adapting existing contact theories and numerical simulation methods to fractional viscoelasticity, which induces a wide relaxation spectrum, we reproduce logarithmic aging under constant load, but show that memory of the contact state is erased upon unloading. Indeed, the contact area behaves as if it had always experienced the reduced load, even on short time-scales, contrasting with the response of a standard linear solid. Moreover, none of our results show a decreasing regime of the contact area after unload: we ultimately prove that this is the case for all linear viscoelastic models -- despite capturing logarithmic aging -- leading to the conclusion that additional local internal variables are required to explain both long-term contact memory and contact area reduction after unloading.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a minimal aggregation-based model, we address the efficient information transfer observed in natural flocks during collective turns. Specifically, we demonstrate that this feature can arise solely from the non-reciprocal nature of local interactions. Through a perturbative analysis, moreover, we find that velocity fluctuations (in the continuum) can be described by a Born approximation. We then show that a wave propagating across the flock undergoes scattering. Our model provides testable predictions and can be extended to study other physical contexts exhibiting polar order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While equilibrium interfaces display universal large-scale statistics, interfaces in phase-separated active and driven systems are predicted to belong to distinct non-equilibrium universality classes. Yet, such behavior has proven difficult to observe, with most systems exhibiting equilibrium-like fluctuations despite their strongly non-equilibrium microscopic dynamics. We introduce an active hard-disk model that contrary to self-propelled models, displays clear non-equilibrium interfacial scaling and observe for the first time, the $|\boldsymbol q|$KPZ and wet-$|\boldsymbol q|$KPZ universality classes while revealing a new, previously overlooked universality class arising in systems with slow crystalline or glassy dynamics. These distinct classes are selected by conservation laws and slow hydrodynamic modes.</description>

For highly flexible polymers, a relatively large number of monomers ($N_c\sim500$) undergo correlated motion at the glass transition temperature $T_g$, independent of molecular weight ($M$). In contrast, less flexible polymers show a complex $N_c(M)$ behaviour divided into three regimes, consistent with observation in both $T_g(M)$ and chain conformational structure. For short oligomers ($\lesssim$ 2 Kuhn steps), a transition from mainly $\it{inter}$molecular correlations and $N_c\sim 200$, to strongly $\it{intra}$molecular correlations and $N_c&lt; 50$ (roughly the molecular size) is observed; for longer chains, $N_c$ increases weakly, before saturating. For poly(methyl methacrylate), a remarkable similarity is found between $N_c(M)$ and the $M$-dependent ratio of the activation barriers of the structural ($\alpha$) and secondary ($\beta$) relaxations. Our results suggest a link between the DH length-scale and the number of $\beta$ relaxation events jointly-activated to facilitate the $\alpha$ relaxation.</description>

Abstract: In many biological systems localized mechanical information is transmitted by mechanically neutral chemical signals. Typical examples include contraction waves in acto-myosin cortex at cellular scale and peristaltic waves at tissue level. In such systems, chemical activity is transformed into mechanical deformation by distributed motor-type mechanisms represented by continuum degrees of freedom. To elucidate the underlying principles of chemo-mechanical coupling, we here present the simplest example, involving directional motion of a localized solitary wave in a distributed mechanical system, guided by a purely chemical cue. Our main result is that mechanical signals can be driven by chemical activity in a highly efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Scaling regimes for unsteady diffusion across particle-stabilized fluid interfaces</title>

Abstract: Colloidal particles at fluid interfaces can enhance the stability of drops and bubbles. Yet, their effect on mass transfer in these multiphase systems remains ambiguous, with some experiments reporting strongly hindered diffusion, while others show nearly no effect, even at near-complete surface coverage. To resolve this ambiguity, we solve the Fick-Jacobs equation for unsteady diffusion, allowing us to treat the particle-laden interface as a locally reduced cross-sectional area for mass transfer. Our numerical solutions reveal two limiting regimes, with the particle layer hindering diffusion only at short times. Guided by analytical solutions for a homogeneous layer with reduced diffusivity, we derive quantitative expressions for the transport regimes and associated transition times for diffusion across the particle layer. This analysis yields a simple criterion for long-term hindrance that accurately distinguishes between conflicting experimental results, providing a unifying framework for mass transfer in particle-laden multiphase systems.</description>
