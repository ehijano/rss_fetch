      <title>Potential of Ka-band Range Rate Post-fit Residuals for High-frequency Mass Change Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first extensive analysis of K/Ka-band ranging post-fit residuals of an official Level-2 product, characterised as Line-of-Sight Gravity Differences (LGD), which exhibit and showcase interesting sub-monthly geophysical signals. These residuals, provided by CSR, were derived from the difference between spherical harmonic coefficient least-squares fits and reduced Level-1B range-rate observations. We classified the geophysical signals into four distinct categories: oceanic, meteorological, hydrological, and solid Earth, focusing primarily on the first three categories in this study. In our examination of oceanic processes, we identified notable mass anomalies in the Argentine basin, specifically within the Zapiola Rise, where persistent remnants of the rotating dipole-like modes are evident in the LGD post-fit residuals. Our analysis extended to the Gulf of Carpentaria and Australia during the 2013 Oswald cyclone, revealing significant LGD residual anomalies that correlate with cyclone tracking and precipitation data. Additionally, we investigated the monsoon seasons in Bangladesh, particularly from June to September 2007, where we observed peaks in sub-monthly variability. These findings were further validated by demonstrating high spatial and temporal correlations between gridded LGD residuals and ITSG-Grace2018 daily solutions. Given that these anomalies are associated with significant mass change phenomena, it is essential to integrate the post-fit residuals into a high-frequency mass change framework, with the purpose of providing enhanced spatial resolution compared to conventional Kalman-filtered methods.</description>

      <title>L$^2$M: Mutual Information Scaling Law for Long-Context Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously establish a bipartite mutual information scaling law in natural language that governs long-range dependencies. This scaling law, which we show is distinct from and scales independently of the conventional two-point mutual information, is the key to understanding long-context language modeling. Using this scaling law, we formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L$^2$M) condition, which relates a model's capacity for effective long context length modeling to the scaling of its latent state size for storing past information. Our results are validated through experiments on both transformers and state space models. This work establishes a theoretical foundation that guides the development of large language models toward longer context lengths.</description>

      <title>Approximate solutions of a general stochastic velocity-jump model subject to discrete-time noisy observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities over time. These tracking data motivate the use of mathematical models to characterise the motion observed. In this paper, we aim to describe the solutions of velocity-jump models for single-agent motion in one spatial dimension, characterised by successive Markovian transitions within a finite network of n states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every other state. In particular, we focus on obtaining the solutions of the model subject to discrete-time noisy observations, with no direct access to the agent state. The lack of direct observation of the hidden state makes the problem of finding the exact distributions generally intractable. Therefore, we derive a series of approximations for the data distributions. We verify the accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to the empirical distributions generated through simulations of four example model structures. These comparisons confirm that the approximations are accurate given sufficiently infrequent state switching relative to the imaging frequency. The approximate distributions computed can be used to obtain fast forwards predictions, to give guidelines on experimental design, and as likelihoods for inference and model selection.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the measured anisotropy $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method fulfills the general premise of measuring the CME but is statistically hungry. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background-contributing sources, because of statistical fluctuations of intertwining variables used in the method, and is thus not practically useful or clean to measure the CME.</description>

      <title>Realization of discretized response in rare-earth vanadates accessed by AC susceptibility and magnetocaloric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.</description>
