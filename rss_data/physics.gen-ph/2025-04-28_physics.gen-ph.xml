      <title>An Accelerating Flat FLRW Model with Observation Constraints and Dynamic $\Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore power law solution of FLRW universe model that is associated with a variable cosmological term $\Lambda(t)$ as a linear function of $\frac{\ddot{a}}{a}, (\frac{\dot{a}}{a})^2$ and $\rho$. The model parameters were estimated on the basis of the four data sets: The Hubble 46 data, the Union 2.1 compilation data sets comprising of distance modulus of 580 SNIa supernovae at different redshifts, the Pantheon data set which contains Apparent magnitudes of 1048 SNIa supernovae at various redshifts and finally BAO data set of volume averaged distances at 5 redshifts. We employ the conventional Bayesian methodology to analyze the observational data and also the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to derive the posterior distributions of the parameters. The best fit values of Hubble parameter $H_0$ as per the four data sets are found as $61.53^{+0.453}_{-0.456}$, $ 69.270^{+0.229}_{-0.228}$, $78.116^ {+0.480}_{-0.479}$, and $ 71.318 ^{+2.473}_{-2.283}$ respectively. Off late the present value of Hubble parameters $H_0$ were empirically given as 73 and 67.7 (km/s)/Mpc using distance ladder techniques and measurements of the cosmic microwave background. The OHD+BAO+Union and ~OHD+Pan+BAO+Union combined data sets provide the best fit Hubble parameter value $H_0$ as $67.427^{+0.197}_{-0.199}$ and $74.997^{+0.143}_{-0.145}$ respectively. The various geometrical and physical properties of the model were also investigated and were found in good agreements with observations.</description>

      <title>Krizek-Somer Anthropic Principle and the Problem of Local Hubble Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Krizek-Somer hypothesis [New Astron. 17, 1 (2012); Grav. Cosmol. 21, 59 (2015)], a biological evolution of the Earth is possible only at certain values of the Hubble parameter, because the increasing luminosity of the Sun should be compensated by the increasing orbital radius of the Earth due to the local Hubble expansion, thereby keeping the Earth's surface temperature sufficiently stable. Here, we examine this hypothesis in light of the recent data on the surface temperature on the early Earth, thereby imposing a few constraints on the admissible values of the local Hubble parameter. As follows from our analysis, the Krizek-Somer mechanism might be a valuable tool to resolve the important geophysical and paleontological puzzles, but the particular value of the local Hubble parameter is substantially affected by the current uncertainties in our knowledge about the temperature and other properties of the early Earth.</description>

      <title>Amaterasu Cosmic Ray as Possible Support for Electromagnetic Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Amaterasu (named for a sun goddess in Japanese mythology) cosmic ray particle announced in November 2023 is extraordinary. Its direction points back to the Local Void which contains no galaxies or known source. It is possible to show that the direction could not have been bent significantly by magnetic fields within the Milky Way. This collection of facts constitutes a paradox. In the present paper, we offer a resolution within the Electromagnetic Accelerating Universe (EAU) model in which a central r\^ole is played by charged Primordial Extremely Massive Black Holes (PEMBHs) whose Coulomb interactions underly accelerating expansion. Because structure formation of PEMBHs is electromagnetic while that for galaxies is gravitational, it is reasonable to expect PEMBHs inside the Local Void. We provide an example where the cosmic ray primary is an antiproton and present it as supportiing evidence for the EAU model.</description>

      <title>Proceedings to the 27th Workshop "What Comes Beyond the Standard Models" Bled, July 8-17, 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The series of meetings ``What comes beyond the Standard Models'' started in 1998 with the idea of organizing a workshop where participants would spend most of the time in discussions, confronting different approaches and ideas.
  The idea was successful and has developed into an annual workshop, which is taking place every year since 1998. Very open-minded and fruitful discussions have become the trademark of our workshops, producing several published works.
  We discussed a lot of concepts which could help to understand our universe from the level of the second quantized elementary fermion and boson fields up to the level of the born of our universe.</description>

      <title>Inconsistencies of nonmetric Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theories and a cure for geometric flows of f(Q) black ellipsoid, toroid and wormhole solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many papers on modified gravity theories (MGTs), and metric-affine geometry have been published. New classes of black hole (BH), wormhole (WH), and cosmological solutions involving nonmetricity and torsion fields were constructed. Nevertheless, the fundamental problems of formulating nonmetric Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell (EDM), equations, and studying important nonmetric gravitational, electromagnetic and fermion effects have not been solved in MGTs. The main goal of this work is to elaborate on a model of nonmetric EDM theory as a generalisation of f(Q) gravity. We develop our anholonomic frame and connection deformation method, which allows us to decouple in a general form and integrate nonmetric gravitational and matter field equations. New classes of generated quasi-stationary solutions are defined by effective sources with Dirac and Maxwell fields, nonmetricity and torsion fields, and generating functions depending, in general, on all space-time coordinates. For respective nonholonomic parameterisations, such solutions describe nonmetric EDM deformations of BH and cosmological metrics. Variants of nonmetric BH, WH and toroid solutions with locally anisotropic polarisations of the gravitational vacuum, masses of fermions, and effective electromagnetic sources are constructed and analysed. Such nonmetric deformed physical objects can't be characterised in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking paradigm if certain effective horizon/ holographic configurations are not involved. We show how to define and compute other types of nonmetric geometric thermodynamic variables using generalisations of the concept of G. Perelman W-entropy.</description>

      <title>That Dot on the Screen: also, what about Born? and other objections to wavefunction physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I address the most common objections to the claim that Schrodinger was right in 1926: the wavefunction provides the correct, and complete, description of atomic phenomena. I suggest that the line of droplets in the Wilson cloud chamber, the click of the ``photon detector", and ``that dot on the screen" can all be explained within a context of wavefunction models and Schrodinger's-type equations, albeit nonlinear. No auxiliary hypotheses about point particles or probabilities are required. The random locations of the triggered ``particle detectors" can be explained by ``chaos" (meaning sensitive dependence on initial conditions). Even Born's ad hoc invocation of probabilities may be justifiable in certain circumstances. As an illustration, I present simulations from a (toy) wavefunction ``particle-detectors" model.</description>

      <title>D-branes, AdS/CFT, dynamical Uhlmann Gauge, and stabilisation of a closed causal loop geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show here that if we construct D-branes not in the form of infinite superpositions of string modes, in order to satisfy the technical condition of coherence by means of eigenstates of annihilation operators, but instead insist on an approximate but much more physical and practical definition based on phase coherence, we obtain finite (and hence realistic) superpositions of string modes that would form realistic D-branes that would encode (at least as a semiclassical approximation) various quantum properties. Re-deriving the AdS/CFT duality by starting in the pre-Maldacena limit from such realistic D-branes would lead to quantum properties on the AdS side of the duality. Causal structures can be modified in various many particle systems, including strings, D-branes, photons, or spins, however, there is a distinction between the emergence of an effective causal structure in the inner degrees of freedom of a material, in the form of a correlation generated effective metric for example in a spin liquid system, and the emergence of a causal structure in an open propagating system by using classical light. I will show how an Uhlmann gauge construction would add stability to a modified causal structure that would retain the shape of a closed causal loop. Various other ideas related to the quantum origin of the string length are also discussed and an analogy of the emergence of string length from quantum correlations with the emergence of wavelength of an electromagnetic wave from coherence conditions of photon modes is presented.</description>

      <title>Uhlmann-Higgs stabilisation of modified causal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical gauge theory for purified quantum fields, based on the Uhlmann connection in the extended system ancilla Hilbert space, and demonstrate that nontrivial Uhlmann holonomies induce global modifications of spacetime causal structure. By coupling purified electromagnetic modes to an emergent U(n) gauge field, we derive an effective metric in the geometric optics limit whose curvature contributions tilt and stretch lightcones.</description>
