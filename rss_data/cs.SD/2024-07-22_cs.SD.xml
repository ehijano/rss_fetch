      <title>Braille-to-Speech Generator: Audio Generation Based on Joint Fine-Tuning of CLIP and Fastspeech2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of Chinese people are troubled by different degrees of visual impairment, which has made the modal conversion between a single image or video frame in the visual field and the audio expressing the same information a research hotspot. Deep learning technologies such as OCR+Vocoder and Im2Wav enable English audio synthesis or image-to-sound matching in a self-supervised manner. However, the audio data used for training is limited and English is not universal for visually impaired people with different educational levels. Therefore, for the sake of solving the problems of data volume and language applicability to improve the reading efficiency of visually impaired people, a set of image-to-speech framework CLIP-KNN-Fastspeech2 based on the Chinese context was constructed. The framework integrates multiple basic models and adopts the strategy of independent pre-training and joint fine-tuning. First, the Chinese CLIP and Fastspeech2 text-to-speech models were pre-trained on two public datasets, MUGE and Baker, respectively, and their convergence was verified. Subsequently, joint fine-tuning was performed using a self-built Braille image dataset. Experimental results on multiple public datasets such as VGGSound, Flickr8k, ImageHear, and the self-built Braille dataset BIT-DP show that the model has improved objective indicators such as BLEU4,FAD(Fr\'echet Audio Distance), WER(Word Error Ratio), and even inference speed. This verifies that the constructed model still has the ability to synthesize high-quality speech under limited data, and also proves the effectiveness of the joint training strategy that integrates multiple basic models.</description>

      <title>Guitar Chord Diagram Suggestion for Western Popular Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chord diagrams are used by guitar players to show where and how to play a chord on the fretboard. They are useful to beginners learning chords or for sharing the hand positions required to play a song.However, the diagrams presented on guitar learning toolsare usually selected from an existing databaseand rarely represent the actual positions used by performers.In this paper, we propose a tool which suggests a chord diagram for achord label,taking into account the diagram of the previous chord.Based on statistical analysis of the DadaGP and mySongBook datasets, we show that some chord diagrams are over-represented in western popular musicand that some chords can be played in more than 20 different ways.We argue that taking context into account can improve the variety and the quality of chord diagram suggestion, and compare this approach with a model taking only the current chord label into account.We show that adding previous context improves the F1-score on this task by up to 27% and reduces the propensity of the model to suggest standard open chords.We also define the notion of texture in the context of chord diagrams andshow through a variety of metrics that our model improves textureconsistencywith the previous diagram.</description>

      <title>Efficient Audio Captioning with Encoder-Level Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant improvement has been achieved in automated audio captioning (AAC) with recent models. However, these models have become increasingly large as their performance is enhanced. In this work, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) framework for AAC. Our analysis shows that in the encoder-decoder based AAC models, it is more effective to distill knowledge into the encoder as compared with the decoder. To this end, we incorporate encoder-level KD loss into training, in addition to the standard supervised loss and sequence-level KD loss. We investigate two encoder-level KD methods, based on mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that contrastive KD is more robust than MSE KD, exhibiting superior performance in data-scarce situations. By leveraging audio-only data into training in the KD framework, our student model achieves competitive performance, with an inference speed that is 19 times faster\footnote{An online demo is available at \url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/wsntxxn/efficient_audio_captioning}}.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Zero-shot Audio Classification using Sound Attribute Knowledge from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot audio classification aims to recognize and classify a sound class that the model has never seen during training. This paper presents a novel approach for zero-shot audio classification using automatically generated sound attribute descriptions. We propose a list of sound attributes and leverage large language model's domain knowledge to generate detailed attribute descriptions for each class. In contrast to previous works that primarily relied on class labels or simple descriptions, our method focuses on multi-dimensional innate auditory attributes, capturing different characteristics of sound classes. Additionally, we incorporate a contrastive learning approach to enhance zero-shot learning from textual labels. We validate the effectiveness of our method on VGGSound and AudioSet\footnote{The code is available at \url{https://www.github.com/wsntxxn/AttrEnhZsAc}.}. Our results demonstrate a substantial improvement in zero-shot classification accuracy. Ablation results show robust performance enhancement, regardless of the model architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open generative models are vitally important for the community, allowing for fine-tunes and serving as baselines when presenting new models. However, most current text-to-audio models are private and not accessible for artists and researchers to build upon. Here we describe the architecture and training process of a new open-weights text-to-audio model trained with Creative Commons data. Our evaluation shows that the model's performance is competitive with the state-of-the-art across various metrics. Notably, the reported FDopenl3 results (measuring the realism of the generations) showcase its potential for high-quality stereo sound synthesis at 44.1kHz.</description>

      <title>Towards Assessing Data Replication in Music Generation with Music Similarity Metrics on Raw Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in music generation are raising multiple concerns about the implications of AI in creative music processes, current business models and impacts related to intellectual property management. A relevant challenge is the potential replication and plagiarism of the training set in AI-generated music, which could lead to misuse of data and intellectual property rights violations. To tackle this issue, we present the Music Replication Assessment (MiRA) tool: a model-independent open evaluation method based on diverse audio music similarity metrics to assess data replication of the training set. We evaluate the ability of five metrics to identify exact replication, by conducting a controlled replication experiment in different music genres based on synthetic samples. Our results show that the proposed methodology can estimate exact data replication with a proportion higher than 10%. By introducing the MiRA tool, we intend to encourage the open evaluation of music generative models by researchers, developers and users concerning data replication, highlighting the importance of ethical, social, legal and economic consequences of generative AI in the music domain.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised ASR Models and Features For Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) based speech foundation models have been applied to a wide range of ASR tasks. However, their application to dysarthric and elderly speech via data-intensive parameter fine-tuning is confronted by in-domain data scarcity and mismatch. To this end, this paper explores a series of approaches to integrate domain fine-tuned SSL pre-trained models and their features into TDNN and Conformer ASR systems for dysarthric and elderly speech recognition. These include: a) input feature fusion between standard acoustic frontends and domain fine-tuned SSL speech representations; b) frame-level joint decoding between TDNN systems separately trained using standard acoustic features alone and those with additional domain fine-tuned SSL features; and c) multi-pass decoding involving the TDNN/Conformer system outputs to be rescored using domain fine-tuned pre-trained ASR models. In addition, fine-tuned SSL speech features are used in acoustic-to-articulatory (A2A) inversion to construct multi-modal ASR systems. Experiments are conducted on four tasks: the English UASpeech and TORGO dysarthric speech corpora; and the English DementiaBank Pitt and Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA elderly speech datasets. The TDNN systems constructed by integrating domain-adapted HuBERT, wav2vec2-conformer or multi-lingual XLSR models and their features consistently outperform the standalone fine-tuned SSL pre-trained models. These systems produced statistically significant WER or CER reductions of 6.53%, 1.90%, 2.04% and 7.97% absolute (24.10%, 23.84%, 10.14% and 31.39% relative) on the four tasks respectively. Consistent improvements in Alzheimer's Disease detection accuracy are also obtained using the DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech recognition outputs.</description>

      <title>MSceneSpeech: A Multi-Scene Speech Dataset For Expressive Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an open source high-quality Mandarin TTS dataset MSceneSpeech (Multiple Scene Speech Dataset), which is intended to provide resources for expressive speech synthesis. MSceneSpeech comprises numerous audio recordings and texts performed and recorded according to daily life scenarios. Each scenario includes multiple speakers and a diverse range of prosodic styles, making it suitable for speech synthesis that entails multi-speaker style and prosody modeling. We have established a robust baseline, through the prompting mechanism, that can effectively synthesize speech characterized by both user-specific timbre and scene-specific prosody with arbitrary text input. The open source MSceneSpeech Dataset and audio samples of our baseline are available at https://speechai-demo.github.io/MSceneSpeech/.</description>

      <title>GE2E-AC: Generalized End-to-End Loss Training for Accent Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accent classification or AC is a task to predict the accent type of an input utterance, and it can be used as a preliminary step toward accented speech recognition and accent conversion. Existing studies have often achieved such classification by training a neural network model to minimize the classification error of the predicted accent label, which can be obtained as a model output. Since we optimize the entire model only from the perspective of classification loss during training time in this approach, the model might learn to predict the accent type from irrelevant features, such as individual speaker identity, which are not informative during test time. To address this problem, we propose a GE2E-AC, in which we train a model to extract accent embedding or AE of an input utterance such that the AEs of the same accent class get closer, instead of directly minimizing the classification loss. We experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed GE2E-AC, compared to the baseline model trained with the conventional cross-entropy-based loss.</description>

      <title>Rasa: Building Expressive Speech Synthesis Systems for Indian Languages in Low-resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We release Rasa, the first multilingual expressive TTS dataset for any Indian language, which contains 10 hours of neutral speech and 1-3 hours of expressive speech for each of the 6 Ekman emotions covering 3 languages: Assamese, Bengali, &amp; Tamil. Our ablation studies reveal that just 1 hour of neutral and 30 minutes of expressive data can yield a Fair system as indicated by MUSHRA scores. Increasing neutral data to 10 hours, with minimal expressive data, significantly enhances expressiveness. This offers a practical recipe for resource-constrained languages, prioritizing easily obtainable neutral data alongside smaller amounts of expressive data. We show the importance of syllabically balanced data and pooling emotions to enhance expressiveness. We also highlight challenges in generating specific emotions, e.g., fear and surprise.</description>

      <title>Topology-Independent GEVD-Based Distributed Adaptive Node-Specific Signal Estimation in Ad-Hoc Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A low-rank approximation-based version of the topology-independent distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation (TI-DANSE) algorithm is introduced, using a generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) for application in ad-hoc wireless acoustic sensor networks. This TI-GEVD-DANSE algorithm as well as the original TI-DANSE algorithm exhibit a non-strict convergence, which can lead to numerical instability over time, particularly in scenarios where the estimation of accurate spatial covariance matrices is challenging. An adaptive filter coefficient normalization strategy is proposed to mitigate this issue and enable the stable performance of TI-(GEVD-)DANSE. The method is validated in numerical simulations including dynamic acoustic scenarios, demonstrating the importance of the additional normalization.</description>

      <title>Speech-to-Speech Translation with Discrete-Unit-Based Style Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) with discrete self-supervised representations has achieved remarkable accuracy, but is unable to preserve the speaker timbre of the source speech. Meanwhile, the scarcity of high-quality speaker-parallel data poses a challenge for learning style transfer during translation. We design an S2ST pipeline with style-transfer capability on the basis of discrete self-supervised speech representations and codec units. The acoustic language model we introduce for style transfer leverages self-supervised in-context learning, acquiring style transfer ability without relying on any speaker-parallel data, thereby overcoming data scarcity. By using extensive training data, our model achieves zero-shot cross-lingual style transfer on previously unseen source languages. Experiments show that our model generates translated speeches with high fidelity and speaker similarity. Audio samples are available at http://stylelm.github.io/ .</description>

      <title>WavCaps: A ChatGPT-Assisted Weakly-Labelled Audio Captioning Dataset for Audio-Language Multimodal Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of audio-language (AL) multimodal learning tasks has been significant in recent years. However, researchers face challenges due to the costly and time-consuming collection process of existing audio-language datasets, which are limited in size. To address this data scarcity issue, we introduce WavCaps, the first large-scale weakly-labelled audio captioning dataset, comprising approximately 400k audio clips with paired captions. We sourced audio clips and their raw descriptions from web sources and a sound event detection dataset. However, the online-harvested raw descriptions are highly noisy and unsuitable for direct use in tasks such as automated audio captioning. To overcome this issue, we propose a three-stage processing pipeline for filtering noisy data and generating high-quality captions, where ChatGPT, a large language model, is leveraged to filter and transform raw descriptions automatically. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of WavCaps dataset and evaluate it on multiple downstream audio-language multimodal learning tasks. The systems trained on WavCaps outperform previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by a significant margin. Our aspiration is for the WavCaps dataset we have proposed to facilitate research in audio-language multimodal learning and demonstrate the potential of utilizing ChatGPT to enhance academic research. Our dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/XinhaoMei/WavCaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite previous efforts in melody-to-lyric generation research, there is still a significant compatibility gap between generated lyrics and melodies, negatively impacting the singability of the outputs. This paper bridges the singability gap with a novel approach to generating singable lyrics by jointly Learning wOrding And Formatting during Melody-to-Lyric training. After general-domain pretraining, our proposed model acquires length awareness first from a large text-only lyric corpus. Then, we introduce a new objective informed by musicological research on the relationship between melody and lyrics during melody-to-lyric training, which enables the model to learn the fine-grained format requirements of the melody. Our model achieves 3.75% and 21.44% absolute accuracy gains in the outputs' number-of-line and syllable-per-line requirements compared to naive fine-tuning, without sacrificing text fluency. Furthermore, our model demonstrates a 63.92% and 74.18% relative improvement of music-lyric compatibility and overall quality in the subjective evaluation, compared to the state-of-the-art melody-to-lyric generation model, highlighting the significance of formatting learning.</description>

      <title>StreamVoice: Streamable Context-Aware Language Modeling for Real-time Zero-Shot Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11053v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent language model (LM) advancements have showcased impressive zero-shot voice conversion (VC) performance. However, existing LM-based VC models usually apply offline conversion from source semantics to acoustic features, demanding the complete source speech and limiting their deployment to real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce StreamVoice, a novel streaming LM-based model for zero-shot VC, facilitating real-time conversion given arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. Specifically, to enable streaming capability, StreamVoice employs a fully causal context-aware LM with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor, while alternately processing semantic and acoustic features at each time step of autoregression which eliminates the dependence on complete source speech. To address the potential performance degradation from the incomplete context in streaming processing, we enhance the context-awareness of the LM through two strategies: 1) teacher-guided context foresight, using a teacher model to summarize the present and future semantic context during training to guide the model's forecasting for missing context; 2) semantic masking strategy, promoting acoustic prediction from preceding corrupted semantic and acoustic input, enhancing context-learning ability. Notably, StreamVoice is the first LM-based streaming zero-shot VC model without any future look-ahead.

      <title>Comparison Performance of Spectrogram and Scalogram as Input of Acoustic Recognition Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic recognition has emerged as a prominent task in deep learning research, frequently utilizing spectral feature extraction techniques such as the spectrogram from the Short-Time Fourier Transform and the scalogram from the Wavelet Transform. However, there is a notable deficiency in studies that comprehensively discuss the advantages, drawbacks, and performance comparisons of these methods. This paper aims to evaluate the characteristics of these two transforms as input data for acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks. The performance of the trained models employing both transforms is documented for comparison. Through this analysis, the paper elucidates the advantages and limitations of each method, provides insights into their respective application scenarios, and identifies potential directions for further research.</description>

      <title>Do Prompts Really Prompt? Exploring the Prompt Understanding Capability of Whisper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research explores how the information of prompts interacts with the high-performing speech recognition model, Whisper. We compare its performances when prompted by prompts with correct information and those corrupted with incorrect information. Our results unexpectedly show that Whisper may not understand the textual prompts in a human-expected way. Additionally, we find that performance improvement is not guaranteed even with stronger adherence to the topic information in textual prompts. It is also noted that English prompts generally outperform Mandarin ones on datasets of both languages, likely due to differences in training data distributions for these languages despite the mismatch with pre-training scenarios. Conversely, we discover that Whisper exhibits awareness of misleading information in language tokens by ignoring incorrect language tokens and focusing on the correct ones. In sum, We raise insightful questions about Whisper's prompt understanding and reveal its counter-intuitive behaviors. We encourage further studies.</description>

      <title>Learn and Don't Forget: Adding a New Language to ASR Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation ASR models often support many languages, e.g. 100 languages in Whisper. However, there has been limited work on integrating an additional, typically low-resource, language, while maintaining performance on the original language set. Fine-tuning, while simple, may degrade the accuracy of the original set. We compare three approaches that exploit adaptation parameters: soft language code tuning, train only the language code; soft prompt tuning, train prepended tokens; and LoRA where a small set of additional parameters are optimised. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) offers an alternative compromise with the potential to maintain performance in specific target languages. Results show that direct fine-tuning yields the best performance for the new language but degrades existing language capabilities. EWC can address this issue for specific languages. If only adaptation parameters are used, the language capabilities are maintained but at the cost of performance in the new language.</description>
