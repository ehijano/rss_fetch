      <title>One-dimensional conduction channels in the correlated Mott NiS2 arising from obstructed Wannier charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NiS2, a compound characterized by its pyrite structure, uniquely bridges the realms of strong correlation physics and topology. While bulk NiS2 is known to be a Mott or charge-transfer insulator, its surface displays anomalous metallic behavior and finite conductivity. Using high-resolution neutron scattering data and symmetry analysis, we propose a refined description of NiS2's magnetic phases by introducing a novel model for its ground state. Combined with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we unveil the presence of edge states in both Ni- and S-terminated surfaces, which exhibit remarkable resilience to external magnetic fields. Although both types of edge states exhibit similar properties, only the edge states at the Ni termination populate the vicinity of the Fermi level and, therefore contribute to the surface conductivity. Utilizing ab initio methods combined with a topological quantum chemistry analysis, we attribute these edge states to obstructed atomic charges originating from bulk topology. Overall, this work not only deepens our understanding of NiS2 but also lays a robust experimental and theoretical foundation for further exploration of the interplay between one-dimensional step-edge states and the Wannier obstruction in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition in the Two-Leg Hubbard Model: Emergence of the Haldane Phase via Diagonal Hopping and Strong Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-leg Hubbard model with diagonal hopping to explore the interplay between geometrical frustration and strong electron-electron interactions. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, we demonstrate the emergence of a topological Haldane phase, which results explicitly from the complementary effects of diagonal hopping-induced frustration and strong on-site Coulomb repulsion. The topological phase transition from a trivial insulator to the nontrivial Haldane phase is characterized by significant changes in magnetic properties, edge correlations, and the appearance of a nonzero string order parameter. Furthermore, we confirm the topological nature of this phase through a detailed analysis of the spin gap and entanglement spectrum, demonstrating clear signatures of symmetry-protected topological order.</description>

      <title>Homes' Law and Universal Planckian Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Zaanen's interpretation of Homes' empirical law~[Zaanen, {\it Nature} {\bf 430}, 512 (2004)], the superconducting transition temperatures in the cuprates are high because their metallic states are as viscous as quantum mechanics permits. Here, we show that Homes' law in fact implies three key points: (i) the resistivity is linear in temperature in the normal state near the transition temperature; (ii) the dimensionless coefficient of proportionality of the relaxation rate with temperature is of order unity -- the so-called universal Planckian relaxation rate; and (iii) the logarithmically broad applicability of this law arises from an unusually wide range of effective masses throughout the cuprate phase diagram. In fact, a universal Planckian relaxation rate implies Homes' law only if the mechanism of mass renormalization is independent of the Planckian relaxation.</description>

      <title>Extended Hybridization Expansion Solver for Impurity Models with Retarded Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the continuous-time hybridization expansion solver to a general form, where the hybridization function and retarded interaction are treated on equal footing. Correlation functions can now be directly obtained via functional derivatives with respect to the bosonic propagators, similar to the measurement of Green's functions. We devise a combinatorial scheme of measuring the correlation function, whose efficiency partially emulates that of the Green's function measurement. The algorithm and numerical methods are validated through application to an impurity model involving both electron-phonon coupling and exchange interactions, a case where the previous hybridization expansion algorithm is not applicable. Our improvement of the hybridization expansion solver promotes its applicability in studies of electron-phonon coupling, the extended dynamical mean field theory, and the dual boson method.</description>

      <title>Two-stage evolution of magnetic correlations in spiral spin liquid material, Ca$_{10}$Cr$_{7}$O$_{28}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an X-band and tunable high-frequency/high-field electron spin resonance (HF-ESR) study of single-crystalline Ca$_{10}$Cr$_{7}$O$_{28}$, which constitutes alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic kagome bilayers. At high temperatures, a phonon-assisted relaxation process is evoked to account for the pronounced increase of the linewidth in an exchange-narrowing regime ($k_{\rm B}T\gg J$). In contrast, at low temperatures ($k_{\rm B}T\lesssim J$), a power-law behavior in line narrowing is observed. Our data reveal two distinct power-law regimes for the linewidth which crossover at $T^*\approx 7.5$~K. Notably, the intriguing evolution of the ESR linewidth in this alternating kagome bilayer system with opposite sign of exchange interactions highlights distinct spin dynamics compared to those in a uniform kagome antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Weak Itinerant Ferromagnetism (WIFM) in MAX phase compound Cr$_{1.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$GeC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic MAX phase compounds are important materials for studying the two-dimensional magnetism because of their layered crystallographic structure. The hexagonal MAX phase compound Cr$_2$GeC is a Pauli paramagnet, and here we report the induction of an ordered magnetic state by doping Fe at the Cr site. Induced magnetism for small doping concentrations (indicated as 5% and 2.5%) is found to have a weak itinerant ferromagnetic character. The Rhodes-Wolhfarth ratio is found to be 13.29, while the coefficient of electronic heat capacity ($\Gamma$) is 27 mJ-mol$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ for Cr$_{1.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$GeC. Our x-ray magnetic circular dichorism measurement confirms that the magnetic moment arises from the Fe atom only, and Cr has negligible contribution towards the ordered moment. Our critical analysis indicates that the magnetic phase transition in Cr$_{1.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$GeC follows mean field theory.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle Dispersion and Density of States of the Half-Filled 2D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing an improved method for analytic continuation and working with imaginary-time correlation functions computed using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we resolve the single-particle dispersion relation and the density of states (DOS) of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasi-particle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states and the associated onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ scattering may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity in the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Valley and Spin Polarized States in Bernal Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results for the evolution of the Fermi surfaces under variation of number density and displacement field for spin and valley-polarized states in Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG) using a realistic form of the electronic dispersion with trigonal warping terms. Earlier studies without trigonal warping have found discrete half-metal and quarter-metal states with full spin and/or valley polarization and complete depletion of some of the Fermi surfaces. We show that when trigonal warping terms are included in the dispersion, partially polarized states with large but non-complete polarization and with both majority and minority carriers present, emerge at small doping, as seen in the experimental data. We show the results when the intervalley and intravalley interactions are equal as well as when they are unequal.</description>

      <title>High Chern numbers and topological flat bands in high-field polarized Kitaev magnets on the star lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometrically frustrated Kitaev magnets are demonstrated to be fertile playgrounds that allow for the occurrence of exotic phenomena, including topological phases and the thermal Hall effect. Notwithstanding the established consensus that the field-polarized phase in the honeycomb-lattice Kitaev magnet hosts topological magnons exhibiting Chern numbers $C = \pm1$, the nature of magnon excitations in Kitaev magnets on the star lattice, a triangle-decorated honeycomb lattice, has rarely been explored primarily due to its complicated geometry. To this end, we study the band topology of magnons on the star lattice in the presence of a strong out-of-plane magnetic field using linear spin-wave theory. By calculating the Chern numbers of magnon bands, we find that topological phase diagrams are predominantly composed of two distinct topological phases whose Chern numbers are different by a sign in inverse order. Remarkably, each phase is characterized by a high Chern number of either $+2$ or $-2$. In addition, several topological flat bands with large flatness are identified. The two phases are separated by a dozen narrow topological high-Chern-number segments, whose region shrinks as the magnetic field increases and vanishes eventually. We also find that the thermal Hall conductivity approaches zero at certain parameters, and it changes (keeps) its sign when crossing the topological phase-transition points (flat-band points).</description>

      <title>Parity violation as enforced symmetry breaking in 3D fermionic topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry can be intrinsically broken in topological phases due to inherent incompatibilities, a phenomenon known as enforced symmetry breaking (ESB) in the framework of topological order. In our previous work, we developed a systematic framework to understand ESB within 2D invertible topological order. Meanwhile, the origin of parity violation in the Standard Model remains one of the most profound mysteries in physics, with no clear explanation to date. In this study, we explore the ESB of parity symmetry by three-dimensional fermionic topological order (fTO), offering potential insights into the origins of parity violation. As the simplest example, here we consider an fTO related to the intrinsic interacting fermionic SPT phase protected by $Z_2^f\times Z_2\times Z_8$ symmetry in three dimensions. We show that time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with ${T}^2=1$ on physical fermions is incompatible with such fTO; then, through the so-called crystalline equivalence principle, we show that the parity symmetry is also incompatible with it. In comparison, conventional TRS with ${T}^2={P}_f$ remains compatible to this fTO. We also discuss a general framework to study the ESB phenomenon for 3D fTO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that the behaviors of the voltage-current characteristics as one enters the low-density insulating state and integer quantum Hall insulating states in the ultra-clean two-dimensional electron system in SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells are qualitatively different. The double-threshold voltage-current curves, representative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime, which does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem.</description>

      <title>Universal low-density power laws of the dc conductivity and Hall constant in the self-consistent Born approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dc conductivity tensor of two-dimensional one-band metals with weak pointlike disorder and magnetic field is studied in the self-consistent Born approximation, with special emphasis on the regime of low carrier density. In this theory, the Kubo conductivity is a functional of the electron dispersion and local (momentum-independent) electron self-energy, which is itself a causal functional of the dispersion and disorder strength. We obtain exact closed expressions for the asymptotic low-density conductivities at zero temperature in the form of power laws of the density and disorder strength with universal exponents. The crossover to the semiclassical regime of high density is studied numerically, as well as the temperature dependence. Our model and results may be relevant to interpret linear magneto-transport experiments performed in the metallic regime of gated two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. Here, we show that the LC order fundamentally changes the nature of the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In a single-orbital model on the kagome lattice near van Hove filling, the LC CDW is a Chern metal, realizable in concrete models, with a partially filled Chern band hosting three Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). We show that Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs is described by three SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings due to LC. The pairing instability is determined by the eigenvalues of the complex representation of the cubic group. We show that the Josephson phase is controlled by the discrete quantum geometry associated with the sublattice permutation group. A small LC can produce a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to a roton superconductor, where the internal phases of the three SC components are locked at 120^\circ and loop supercurrents circulate around an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. We demonstrate by self-consistent calculations the properties of the roton superconductor and make theoretical predictions related to the recent experimental evidence for an exotic SC state in CsV3Sb5 exhibiting TRS breaking, anisotropic SC gap, pair density wave modulations, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems such as the moire structures.</description>

      <title>Energy Dispersion, Superconductivity and Magnetic Fluctuations in Stacked Altermagnetism Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12710v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, altermagnetism (AM) has emerged as a new category of magnetism, alongside conventional antiferromagnetism (AFM) and ferromagnetism (FM). In an AM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized bands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports spin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate spin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either absent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials could resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new electronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In a 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions of both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet stacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy dispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic fluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and pairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also supports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer AM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including topology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that stacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in exploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced coherent terahertz emission from critical superconducting fluctuations in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent terahertz (THz) emission is emerging as a powerful new tool to probe symmetry breakings in quantum materials. This method relies on second order optical nonlinearities and is complementary to second harmonic generation spectroscopy. Here, we report coherent THz emission from Josephson plasmons in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, and find that the amplitude of the emitted field increases dramatically close to the superconducting transition temperature, $T_C$. We show theoretically how emission is enhanced by critical superconducting fluctuations, a nonlinear analogue of critical opalescence. This observation is expected to be of general importance for the study of many thermal and quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry protected topological wire in a topological vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and nematic order of Bose-Fermi mixtures in moir\'e superlattices of 2D semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic orders in a mixture of Boson (exciton) and Fermion (electron or hole) trapped in transition-metal dichalcogenides moir\'e superlattices. A sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is found between a carrier and an interlayer exciton trapped at different high symmetry points of the moir\'e supercell. This interaction at a distance much shorter than the carrier-carrier separation dominates the magnetic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, where the carrier sublattice develops ferromagnetism opposite to that in the exciton sublattice. We demonstrate the possibility of increasing the Curie temperature of moir\'e carriers through electrical tuning of the exciton density in the ground state. In a trilayer moir\'e system with a p-n-p type band alignment, the exciton-carrier interplay can establish a layered antiferromagnetism for holes confined in the two outer layers. We further reveal a spontaneous nematic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, arising from the interference between the Coulomb interaction and p-wave interlayer tunneling dictated by the stacking registry.</description>

      <title>Low-energy interband Kondo bound states in orbital-selective Mott phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy excitations in correlated electron systems may show intricate behaviors and provide essential insights into the dynamics of quantum states and phase transitions. Here, we study a typical half-filled two-orbital Hubbard model featuring the so-called holon-doublon (HD) low-energy excitations in the orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP), where the principal form of the low-energy excitations has been considered to be a HD bound state. We employ standard single-site dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), using NORG as an improved impurity solver to calculate the spectral functions at zero temperature. We show that the HD bound state gives an incomplete or even wrong picture for the low-energy excitations. Instead, the excitations are composed of a Kondo-like state in the wide band and a doublon in the narrow band, termed as inter-band Kondo-like (IBK) bound states. Remarkably, we find that, as the bandwidths of the two bands approach each other, anomalous IBK bound-state excitations appear in the metallic {\em wide} band. Our study provides a new picture for the low-energy excitations in the OSMP.</description>

      <title>Structurally triggered orbital and charge orderings in TlMnO$_3$ and related compounds</title>

Abstract: Rare earth perovskites ($R^{3+}$M$^{3+}$O$_3$), with $e_g^1$ electronic occupation of the M $d$ states, display different types of metal-insulator transition. For manganites (M=Mn), metal-insulator transition is usually induced by the Jahn-Teller ($JT$) distortions, which stabilize orbital orderings (OO) at Mn sites. Among them, LaMnO$_3$ shows a $C$ type OO and crystallizes with $Pbnm$ structure. Whereas, TlMnO$_3$ shows a very distinct $G$ type OO with an unusual $P\overline{1}$ structure. Employing first principles calculations, and symmetry mode analysis we rationalize structural and electronic origin of $G$-type OO in TlMnO$_3$. Going further, we consider nickelates (M=Ni), where metal-insulator transition is driven by a breathing distortion, which stabilizes the charge ordering (CO) at Ni sites. Interestingly, different $JT$ and breathing distortions are very similar MO$_6$ octahedral distortions and stem from high frequency phonon modes of ideal $Pm\overline3m$ structure. Our comparative study reveals that following a common triggering mechanism these modes appear in their respective ground states.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Spinons with Magnetic Fields in a Fractionalized State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice Ba4Nb1-xRu3+xO12 is believed to feature a universal heavy spinon Fermi surface that underpins both a quantum spin liquid (QSL) and an adjacent heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM) phase, depending on Nb content. The itinerant spinons act as heat carriers that render the charge-insulating QSL a much better thermal conductor than the HFSM [1]. We find that application of magnetic field up to 14 T surprisingly induces an abrupt rise in the heat capacity by as much as 5000%, which breaks the signature linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity of both phases below 150 mK. In contrast, the AC magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity show little response up to 14 T over the same milli-Kelvin temperature range. Applied magnetic field also readily suppresses the thermal conductivity by up to 40% with decreasing temperature below 4 K. All these complex thermal phenomena reveal that application of magnetic field drastically alters the behavior of spinons at low temperatures. The astonishing rise in the heat capacity (and thus entropy) at milli-Kelvin temperatures and strong magnetic fields presents a highly unusual situation that demands novel physics.</description>

      <title>Near room-temperature ferromagnetism from double-exchange in the van der Waals material CrGeTe$_3$: evidence from optical conductivity under pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unexpected discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in layered van der Waals materials has sparked interest in both their fundamental properties and their potential for novel applications. Recent studies suggest near room-temperature ferromagnetism in the pressurized van der Waals crystal CrGeTe$_3$. We perform a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of magnetism and electronic correlations in CrGeTe$_3$, combining broad-frequency reflectivity measurements with density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. Our experimental optical conductivity spectra trace the signatures of developing ferromagnetic order and of the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) as a function of temperature and hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, we observe the emergence of a mid-infrared feature in the optical conductivity, indicating the development of strong orbital-selective correlations in the high-pressure ferromagnetic phase. We find a distinct relationship between the plasma frequency and Curie temperature of CrGeTe$_3$, which strongly suggests that a double-exchange mechanism is responsible for the observed near room-temperature ferromagnetism. Our results clearly demonstrate the existence of a charge-transfer gap in the metallic phase, ruling out its previously conjectured collapse under pressure.</description>

Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</description>

Abstract: The inelastic neutron scattering results and their analysis unequivocally point to a dominant Kitaev interaction in the honeycomb-lattice cobaltate BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. Our anisotropic-exchange model closely describes $all$ available neutron scattering data in the material's field-polarized phase. The density-matrix renormalization group results for our model are in close accord with the unusual double-zigzag magnetic order and the low in-plane saturation field of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Green's Functions Measurements in the Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the hybrid quantum-classical variational cluster approach (VCA) to strongly correlated electron systems one of the goals of a quantum subroutine is to find single-particle correlation functions of lattice fermions in polynomial time. Previous works suggested to use variants of the Hadamard test for this purpose, which requires an implementation of controlled single-particle fermionic operators. However, for a number of locality-preserving mappings to encode fermions into qubits, a direct construction of such operators is not possible. In this work, we propose a new quantum algorithm, which uses an analog of the Kubo formula adapted to a quantum circuit simulating the Hubbard model. It allows to access the Green's function of a cluster directly using only bilinears of fermionic operators and circumvents the usage of the Hadamard test. We test our new algorithm in practice by using open-access simulators of noisy IBM superconducting chips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <title>Scar-induced imbalance in staggered Rydberg ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02500v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the kinematically-constrained model of Rydberg atoms on a two-leg ladder with staggered detuning, $\Delta \in [0,1]$, has quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in its spectrum and represents a non-perturbative generalization of the paradigmatic PXP model defined on a chain. We show that these QMBS result in coherent many-body revivals and site-dependent magnetization dynamics for both N\'eel and Rydberg vacuum initial states around $\Delta=1$. The latter feature leads to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)-violating finite imbalance at long times in a disorder-free system. This is further demonstrated by constructing appropriate local imbalance operators that display nonzero long-time averages for N\'eel and vacuum initial states. We also study the fidelity and Shannon entropy for such dynamics which, along with the presence of long-time finite imbalance, brings out the qualitatively different nature of QMBS in PXP ladders with $\Delta \sim 1$ from those in the PXP chain. Finally, we identify additional exact mid-spectrum zero modes that stay unchanged as a function of $\Delta$ and violate ETH.</description>

      <title>Quantum vorticity: a not so effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on ``link complements'', i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to GHZ-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state. These results generalize to any three dimensional topological field theory with a dual chiral rational conformal field theory.</description>
