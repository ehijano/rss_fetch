      <title>First close-coupling study of the excitation of a large cyclic molecule: collision of c-C5H6 with He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent astronomical observations revealed an increasing molecular complexity in the interstellar medium through the detection of a series of large cyclic carbon species. To correctly interpret these detections, a complex analysis is necessary that takes into account the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions of the emitting media (e.g. when energy level populations deviate from a Boltzman distribution). This requires proper state-to-state collisional data for the excitation and de-excitation processes of the molecular levels. Cyclopentadiene (c-C5H6), which was recently detected in multiple cold interstellar clouds, is extensively studied in many aspects due to its large importance for chemistry in general. At the same time, there are no collisional data available for this species, which are necessary for a more precise interpretation of the corresponding detections. In this work, we first provide an accurate 3D rigid-rotor interaction potential for the [c-C5H6 + He] complex from high-level of ab initio theories, which has been used to study their inelastic collision by the exact close coupling quantum scattering method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where this method is systematically applied to treat the dynamics of molecular collisions involving more than ten atoms. We also analyse the collisional propensity rules and the differences in contrast to calculations, where the approximate coupled states scattering methods is used.</description>

      <title>Exploring coherent dynamics in resonant x-ray scattering of intense ultrafast pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) offer unique opportunities to control inner-shell electrons on ultrafast timescales. This study presents a theoretical framework for modeling resonant x-ray scattering under intense ultrafast pulses, focusing on the coherent dynamics of Rabi oscillations. We employ a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation approach to investigate the effects of high-intensity pulses on the single atom response which includes resonant fluorescence and elastic scattering channels, and competing decay processes. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of scattering responses to pulse parameters and initial states, with interference effects playing a significant role.</description>
