      <title>Mainframe-style channel controllers for modern disaggregated memory systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or "far" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.
  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.
  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.</description>

      <title>On the Impossibility of a Perfect Hypervisor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a fundamental impossibility result for a `perfect hypervisor', one that (1) preserves every observable behavior of any program exactly as on bare metal and (2) adds zero timing or resource overhead.
  Within this model we prove two theorems. (1) Indetectability Theorem. If such a hypervisor existed, no guest-level program, measurement, or timing test could distinguish it from native execution; all traces, outputs, and timings would be identical.
  (2) Impossibility Theorem. Despite that theoretical indetectability, a perfect hypervisor cannot exist on any machine with finite computational resources.
  These results are architecture-agnostic and extend beyond hypervisors to any virtualization layer emulators, sandboxes, containers, or runtime-instrumentation frameworks. Together they provide a formal foundation for future work on the principles and limits of virtualization.</description>

      <title>PerfTracker: Online Performance Troubleshooting for Large-scale Model Training in Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Troubleshooting performance problems of large model training (LMT) is immensely challenging, due to unprecedented scales of modern GPU clusters, the complexity of software-hardware interactions, and the data intensity of the training process. Existing troubleshooting approaches designed for traditional distributed systems or datacenter networks fall short and can hardly apply to real-world training systems. In this paper, we present PerfTracker, the first online troubleshooting system utilizing fine-grained profiling, to diagnose performance issues of large-scale model training in production. PerfTracker can diagnose performance issues rooted in both hardware (e.g., GPUs and their interconnects) and software (e.g., Python functions and GPU operations). It scales to LMT on modern GPU clusters. PerfTracker effectively summarizes runtime behavior patterns of fine-grained LMT functions via online profiling, and leverages differential observability to localize the root cause with minimal production impact. PerfTracker has been deployed as a production service for large-scale GPU clusters of O(10, 000) GPUs (product homepage https://help.aliyun.com/zh/pai/user-guide/perftracker-online-performance-analysis-diagnostic-tool). It has been used to diagnose a variety of difficult performance issues.</description>
