      <title>Mass and angular momentum for the Kerr black hole in TEGR and STEGR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy-momentum characteristics of the rotating black hole - Kerr solution of general relativity in the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR). The previously constructed spacetime covariant and Lorentz invariant expressions for conserved Noether currents, superpotentials and charges are used. The Noether charges describe total energy, momentum or angular momentum of gravitating system depending on a choice of the displacement vector $\xi$. To define covariant and invariant conserved quantities both in TEGR and in STEGR on needs to use external fields which are flat teleparallel connections. To determine the non-dynamical connections in TEGR and STEGR we use the unified ``turning off'' gravity principle. Besides, to analyse the Noether conserved quantities in these theories, we use the concept of ``gauges''. The gauge changing can affect the Noether conserved quantities. We highlight two ways to turn off gravity - by $M \to 0$ and by $M \to 0 , ~ a \to 0$ which gives us different gauges in TEGR and STEGR. In both kind of gauges we get the expected values of black hole mass and angular momentum. Our attempts to find gauges which could lead to a correspondence to Einstein's equivalence principle for the Kerr solution where unsuccessful both in TEGR and STEGR. However, these exercises helped us to find a related gauge for the Schwarzschild solution in STEGR that is a novelty.</description>

      <title>Two-Time Relativistic Bohmian Model of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the recently presented Two-Time relativistic Bohmian Model (TTBM) is first rigorously and thoroughly summarized: definition, salient properties and observational explanations (double-slit experiment). Secondly, the theory is applied to a generic spherical atomic orbit, obtaining oscillations of the electron in the new time dimension, {\tau} , that demonstrate the static nature of the orbitals. Something very similar happens in the case of a particle in box, where {\tau}-oscillations cause the particle to spread out at steady states. Some speculations about spin and astrophysical follow. Finally, strengths and pending tasks of the model are summarized.</description>
