      <title>Probing jet-medium interactions via jet substructure observables in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of jet substructure observables in $pp$ and PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$~TeV using a multi-phase transport model. To suppress background contamination, the constituent subtraction method is employed for both PbPb and smeared $pp$ events. The jet splitting momentum fraction ($z_g$) and the groomed jet mass to the ungroomed jet transverse momentum ($M_g / p_{T,\text{jet}}$) are reconstructed using the Soft Drop algorithm with two grooming parameter settings. With $z_\text{cut} = 0.1$ and $\beta = 0.0$, a slight modification in the $z_g$ distribution is observed in central PbPb collisions, whereas a pronounced enhancement in the high $M_g / p_{T,\text{jet}}$ region is found, particularly at low $p_{T,\text{jet}}$ and in more central events. A detailed analysis of the dynamical evolution stages reveals that this enhancement primarily originates from jet-medium interactions, whereas the contributions from hadronization and hadronic rescatterings are largely mitigated by the grooming procedure. In contrast, under a stronger grooming condition ($z_\text{cut} = 0.5$, $\beta = 1.5$), no significant changes in $M_g / p_{T,\text{jet}}$ are observed, indicating that the medium-induced modifications are predominantly associated with large-angle scattering.</description>

      <title>Study of entanglement in Ne, Mg, and Si isotopic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we have presented the results for mode entanglement and its evolution in Ne, Mg, and Si isotopic chains. A detailed study has also been conducted on the role of nuclear forces with the assistance of the spin-tensor decomposition of two-body interaction into three components: central, spin-orbit, and tensor. This study can shed light on the high entanglement entropy observed for $N=Z$ nuclei and the importance of the tensor component on the proton-neutron entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Determination of Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients Based on the Dispersive Optical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for determining asymptotic normalization coefficients for removing nucleons from nuclei is proposed. It is based on the use of the dispersive optical model potential. Within the method, the strength parameter of the Hartree- Fock type potential at the Fermi energy is the only one fitting parameter. It was found that adjusting this parameter allows us to achieve a coincidence of the calculated binding energies with the experimental ones accurately enough. Specific calculations were carried out for 17O, 17F, 41Ca, and 41Sc nuclei. An acceptable agreement with the results of other works, which are characterized by a noticeable spread, was achieved.</description>

      <title>The perfect spinfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of non-dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that incorporates spin degrees of freedom into the divergence-type theory framework. Due to the divergence-type structure, it is straightforward to enforce non-linear causality and symmetric hyperbolicity of the equations of motion, ensuring local well-posedness of the initial-value problem and stability of the theory. Furthermore, in a specific realization based on spin kinetic theory, we prove that the equations of motion remain non-linearly causal and symmetric-hyperbolic to all orders in the spin potential, provided a specific thermodynamic constraint is satisfied. This framework can be applied for numerical simulations to study the dynamics of spin-polarized fluids, such as the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin thickness for $^{nat}$Pb, $^{159}$Tb and effects of deformation on matter radii for Mg, Na, Ar isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data on reaction cross section $\sigma_{\rm R}$ of proton scattering are available for $^{nat}$Pb (natural lead) and $^{159}$Tb. In addition, data on $\sigma_{\rm R}$ and/or interaction ones $\sigma_{\rm I}$ are available for Mg, Na, Ar isotopes. Our aim is to determine neutron skin thickness $r_{\rm skin}$ for $^{nat}$Pb, $^{159}$Tb and to investigate effects of deformation for Mg, Na, Ar isotopes. We use the chiral (Kyushu) $g$-matrix folding model for lower energies and the folding model based on the Love-Franey (LF) $t$-matrix for higher energies. For $^{159}$Tb, our skin value is $r_{\rm skin}=0.273 \pm 0.073$~fm. As for $^{24}$Mg, our matter radius $r_{\rm m}(\sigma_{\rm R})=3.03 \pm 0.08$~fm determined from $\sigma_{\rm R}$ includes effects of deformation, whereas the corresponding $r_{\rm m}(\sigma_{\rm I})=2.79 \pm 0.15$~fm does not. Effects of deformation are seen for Mg isotopes, $^{21, 23}$Na, $^{40}$Ar. Our result $r_{\rm skin}=0.271 \pm 0.008$~fm for $^{nat}$Pb agrees with $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm PREX\text{-}II}) = 0.283\pm 0.071$~fm for $^{208}$Pb, where we assume $A=208$ for $^{nat}$Pb.</description>

      <title>Novel Phases of a Baryon-Dense QCD-like Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phases of a strongly coupled QCD-like theory at finite baryon chemical potential using s-confining supersymmetric QCD deformed by anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Focusing on the case of three colors and four flavors, we identify novel phases including spontaneous breaking of baryon number and/or parity. Both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed as the baryon chemical potential is varied. These findings may offer insights into possible phases of real QCD at intermediate baryon densities.</description>

      <title>Interferometry Radii at RHIC BES Energies within the integrated HydroKinetic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a correlation femtoscopy analysis of relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) energies using the extended integrated HydroKinetic Model (iHKMe). The model combines initial conditions from UrQMD transport simulations, a gradual pre-equilibrium relaxation stage, viscous hydrodynamic evolution, and a hadronic cascade, providing a comprehensive description of the system's full dynamical evolution. Special emphasis is placed on the impact of extended nuclear overlap times and partial thermalization, which are characteristic of intermediate collision energies (sqrt(s_NN) = 7.7-39 GeV). The corresponding correlation femtoscopy scales, or interferometry (HBT) radii, are calculated across a range of collision energies and compared with experimental data to assess the sensitivity of femtoscopic observables to the equation of state (EoS). Two EoS scenarios are explored. The model demonstrates good agreement with experimental femtoscopy measurements, particularly at lower BES energies. These results enhance our understanding of the space-time structure of the particle-emitting source and provide valuable insight into the nature of the QCD phase transition in the intermediate energy regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtoscopy offers a sensitive probe of hadron emission sources and hadronic interactions. In this study, we examine relativistic corrections to scattering phase shifts and correlation functions using the two-body Dirac equation framework. We analyze the impact of the Darwin term and spin-dependent potentials, showing that these relativistic effects, especially spin-related interactions, significantly enhance the proton-proton correlation function. Our findings emphasize the necessity of including relativistic corrections for precise femtoscopic analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the valence quark distributions of the kaons in an isospin asymmetric dense strange medium consisting of nucleons and hyperons. The comparative analysis of in-medium parton distribution functions, electromagnetic form factors, and charge densities with respect to the free space distributions is studied in the light-cone quark model. The medium effects are incorporated in these distribution functions by using the effective quark masses, computed from the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model for finite values of baryonic density, isospin asymmetry, and strangeness fraction parameters. We observe a suppression of the kaon electromagnetic form factors and a redistribution of charge density in high-density strange matter.</description>

      <title>Solving the QCD effective kinetic theory with neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-by-event QCD kinetic theory simulations are hindered by the large numerical cost of evaluating the high-dimensional collision integral in the Boltzmann equation. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used to obtain an accurate estimate of the collision integral in a fraction of the time required for the ordinary Monte Carlo evaluation of the integral. We demonstrate that for isotropic and anisotropic distribution functions, the network accurately predicts the time evolution of the distribution function, which we verify by performing traditional evaluations of the collision integral and comparing several moments of the distribution function. This work sets the stage for an event-by-event modeling of the pre-equilibrium initial stages in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Antideuteron Flux Within a Dynamical Coalescence Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic antideuterons are considered as one of the most promising tools for the indirect detection of dark matter due to their ultra-low astrophysical backgrounds. Currently only upper limits on the antideuteron flux exist, but advancements in experimental detection technology may soon lead to positive signals. A major source of background is the production of secondary antideuterons through collisions of cosmic rays with the surrounding medium. In this study, antideuteron production is modeled using a multiphase transport model (AMPT) coupled with a dynamical coalescence model. By applying a widely used leaky box model and incorporating specific processes, we present a new theoretical baseline for atmospheric secondary antideuteron flux, including a tertiary contribution, from primary cosmic rays interacting with Earth's atmosphere. Our results indicate that the atmospheric antideuteron flux are within the range of various existing calculations and remain well below the upper limits set by the Balloon-borne Experiment with a Superconducting Spectrometer (BESS). The atmospheric antideuteron is found to dominate the antideuteron background at kinetic energies below $0.26 $ GeV/n.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars with large quark cores within the parity doublet model and modified NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the parity doublet model (PDM) for hadronic matter and a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter, we investigate the potential existence of two- and three-flavor quark matter in neutron star cores. Both models respect chiral symmetry, and a sharp first-order phase transition is implemented via Maxwell construction. We find stable neutron stars with quark cores within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. Typical neutron stars with masses around $1.4 \ M_\odot$ may possess deconfined quark matter in their centers. The hybrid star scenario with a two-flavor quark core offers enough parameter space to allow the neutron stars with large quark cores exceeding $\sim 1\ M_\odot$, and allow the early deconfinement position before $2\ \rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. The observations of gravitational wave event GW170817 suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600\ \rm MeV$ in the PDM for scenarios involving three-flavor quark matter cores. The maximum mass of the hybrid star with a quark core is found to be approximately $2.2\ M_\odot$ for both two- or three-flavor quark matter in their centers.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Photoabsorption Cross Sections studied within the axially deformed Relativistic Quasiparticle Finite Amplitude Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoabsorption cross sections for 235 stable nuclei, ranging from $^{40}$Ca to $^{209}$Bi, were investigated by the quasiparticle finite amplitude method (QFAM) based on the axially deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB) approach using relativistic point-coupling interaction DD-PC1, with extensions to odd-A nuclei. GDR parameters based on the standard Lorentzian (SLO) model were extracted from QFAM results and compared with those from experimental data recommended by IAEA. Good agreement was achieved for giant dipole resonance (GDR) peak energies, while resonance widths were underestimated and hence peak cross sections were overestimated due to the lack of higher-order many-body correlations. These discrepancies were much improved in deformed nuclei. The effects of deformation on photoabsorption cross sections were examined systematically. The comparison of photoabsorption cross sections among QFAM results and discrepant experimental data revealed the potential of QFAM calculations in the evaluation of photonuclear data.</description>

      <title>Estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions using a transfer matrix formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for extracting energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions by computing the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix associated with the lattice QCD Hamiltonian. While mathematically and numerically equivalent to the recently introduced Lanczos procedure, our approach introduces a novel prescription for removing spurious eigenvalues using a kernel density estimator (KDE) and Gaussian-convoluted histogram method. This strategy yields a robust and stable estimate of the energy spectrum, outperforming the Cullum-Willoughby filtering technique in efficiency. In addition, we detail how this method can be applied to extract overlap factors from two-point correlation functions, as well as matrix elements from three-point functions with a current insertion. Furthermore, we extend the methodology to accommodate correlation matrices constructed from a variational basis of operators, with its Block formulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework by computing the two lowest energy levels for a broad range of hadrons, including several nuclei. Although the signal-to-noise ratio is not significantly improved, the extracted energy levels are found to be more reliable than those obtained with conventional techniques. Within a given statistical ensemble, the proposed method effectively captures both statistical uncertainties and systematic errors, including those arising from the choice of fitting window, making it a robust and practical tool for lattice QCD analysis.</description>

Abstract: A systematic analysis of the $K^\ast\Sigma$ photoproduction off proton is performed with all the available differential cross section data. We carry out a strategy different from the previous studies of these reactions, where, instead of fixing the parameters of the added resonances from PDG or pentaquark models, we add the resonance with a specific $J^P$ and leave its parameters to be determined from the experimental data. When adding only one resonance, the best result is to add one $N(3/2^-)$ resonance around $2097$ MeV, which substantially reduces the $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to $1.35$. There are two best solutions when adding two resonances, one is to add one $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ and one $N^\ast(7/2^-)$, the other is to add one $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ and one $\Delta^\ast(7/2^-)$, leading the $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to be $1.10$ and $1.09$, respectively. The mass values of the $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ in the two resonance solutions are both near $2070$ MeV. Our solutions indicate that the $N(3/2^-)$ resonance around $2080$ MeV is strongly coupled with the $K^\ast\Sigma$ final state and support the molecular picture of $N(2080, 3/2^-)$.</description>
