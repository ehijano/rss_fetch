      <title>Almost free modules, perfect decomposition and Enochs's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a module $X$ and a regular cardinal $\kappa$ we study various notions of $(\kappa,\mathrm{Add}(X))$-freeness and $(\kappa,\mathrm{Add}(X))$-separability. Bearing on appropriate set-theoretic assumptions, we construct a non-trivial $\kappa^+$-generated, $(\kappa^+,\mathrm{Add}(X))$-free and $(\kappa^+,\mathrm{Add}(X))$-separable module. Our construction allows $\kappa$ to be singular thus extending \cite[Theorem~4.7]{CortesGuilTorrecillas}. Bearing on similar set-theoretic assumptions, we characterize when every module $X$ has a perfect decomposition. As a subproduct we show that Enoch's conjecture for classes $\mathrm{Add}(X)$ is consistent with ZFC -- a fact first proved by \v{S}aroch \cite{Saroch}.</description>

      <title>Unifying some classical results on Artinian rings and modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a very crude but natural notion of measure on the class of left R-modules over a ring R. We use this notion to give short proofs of some classical theorems on (left) Artinian rings and modules, due to Akizuki, Anderson, Hopkins, and Levitzki, as well as of some new results.</description>

      <title>Alternating and symmetric superpowers of metric generalized Jordan superpairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to define and study the constructions of alternating and symmetric (super)powers of metric generalized Jordan (super)pairs. These constructions are obtained by transference via the Faulkner construction. The construction of tensor (super)products for metric generalized Jordan (super)pairs is revisited. We assume that the base field $\mathbb{F}$ has characteristic different from $2$.</description>

      <title>Sign regular matrices and variation diminution: single-vector tests and characterizations, following Schoenberg, Gantmacher-Krein, and Motzkin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variation diminution (VD) is a fundamental property in total positivity theory, first studied in 1912 by Fekete-P\'olya for one-sided P\'olya frequency sequences, followed by Schoenberg, and by Motzkin who characterized sign regular (SR) matrices using VD and some rank hypotheses. A classical theorem by Gantmacher-Krein characterized the strictly sign regular (SSR) $m \times n$ matrices for $m&gt;n$ using this property.
  In this article we strengthen these results by characterizing all $m \times n$ SSR matrices using VD. We further characterize strict sign regularity of a given sign pattern in terms of VD together with a natural condition motivated by total positivity. We then refine Motzkin's characterization of SR matrices by omitting the rank condition and specifying the sign pattern. This concludes a line of investigation on VD started by Fekete-P\'olya [Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 1912] and continued by Schoenberg [Math. Z. 1930], Motzkin [PhD thesis, 1936], Gantmacher-Krein [1950 book], Brown-Johnstone-MacGibbon [J. Amer. Stat. Assoc. 1981], and Choudhury [Bull. London Math. Soc. 2022, Bull. Sci. Math. 2023].
  In fact we show stronger characterizations, by employing single test vectors with alternating sign coordinates - i.e., lying in the alternating bi-orthant. We also show that test vectors chosen from any other orthant will not work.</description>

      <title>Deformation Cohomology of Lie-Yamaguti algebras and Free Lie-Yamaguti algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinitesimal deformation theory of Lie-Yamaguti algebras was introduced by Tao Zhang and Juan Li . We extend their theory to develop formal one-parameter deformation theory of Lie-Yamaguti algebras. It turns out that the right deformation cohomology which controls deformations in this context, is a variant of Lie-Yamaguti algebra cohomology which we introduce in this paper. At the end, we introduce the free object in the category of Lie-Yamaguti algebras and prove that it is rigid.</description>

      <title>Hyperpolyadic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01366v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of division algebras, the hyperpolyadic algebras, which correspond to the binary division algebras $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$ without considering new elements. First, we use the matrix polyadization procedure proposed earlier which increases the dimension of the algebra. The algebras obtained in this way obey binary addition and a nonderived n-ary multiplication and their subalgebras are division n-ary algebras. For each invertible element we define a new norm which is polyadically multiplicative, and the corresponding map is a $n$-ary homomorphism. We define a polyadic analog of the Cayley-Dickson construction which corresponds to the consequent embedding of monomial matrices from the polyadization procedure. We then obtain another series of n-ary algebras corresponding to the binary division algebras which have a higher dimension, that is proportional to the intermediate arities. Second, a new polyadic product of vectors in any vector space is defined. Endowed with this product the vector space becomes a polyadic algebra which is a division algebra under some invertibility conditions, and its structure constants are computed. Third, we propose a new iterative process ("imaginary tower"), which leads to nonunital nonderived ternary division algebras of half the dimension, which we call "half-quaternions" and "half-octonions". The latter are not subalgebras of the binary division algebras, but subsets only, since they have different arity. Nevertheless, they are actually ternary division algebras, because they allow division, and their nonzero elements are invertible. From the multiplicativity of the introduced "half-quaternion" norm we obtain the ternary analog of the sum of two squares identity. We show that the ternary division algebra of imaginary "half-octonions" is unitless and totally associative.</description>

      <title>Dual Quaternion Laplacian, Directed Gain Graph and Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the multi-agent formation control problem in a directed graph. We show that a desired relative configuration scheme is reasonable in a directed graph if and only if for any cycle in this directed graph, the product of relative configurations of the forward arcs, and inverses of relative configurations of the backward arcs, is equal to $1$. We then show that for a reasonable desired relative configuration scheme in a directed and connected graph, the dual quaternion Laplacian is similar to the unweighted Laplacian of the directed graph, zero is an eigenvalue of these two Laplacian matrices, and a formation vector is a desired formation satisfying this reasonable desired relative configuration scheme if and only if it is a unit dual quaternion vector and an eigenvector, corresponding to the zero eigenvalue, of the dual quaternion Laplacian matrix. A numerical method is given to determine {whether} a given desired relative configuration scheme is reasonable or not. A control law is presented when the desired relative configuration scheme is reasonable. Our discussion is extended to general directed gain graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02418v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A locally coherent exact category is a finitely accessible additive category endowed with an exact structure in which the admissible short exact sequences are the directed colimits of admissible short exact sequences of finitely presentable objects. We show that any exact structure on a small idempotent-complete additive category extends uniquely to a locally coherent exact structure on the category of ind-objects; in particular, any finitely accessible category has the unique maximal and the unique minimal locally coherent exact category structures. All locally coherent exact categories are of Grothendieck type in the sense of Stovicek. We also discuss the canonical embedding of a small exact category into the abelian category of additive sheaves in connection with the locally coherent exact structure on the ind-objects, and deduce two periodicity theorems as applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersolvable hyperplane arrangements and matroids are known to give rise to certain Koszul algebras, namely their Orlik-Solomon algebras and graded Varchenko-Gel'fand algebras. We explore how this interacts with group actions, particularly for the braid arrangement and the action of the symmetric group, where the Hilbert functions of the algebras and their Koszul duals are given by Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds, respectively. The corresponding symmetric group representations exhibit branching rules that interpret Stirling number recurrences, which are shown to apply to all supersolvable arrangements. They also enjoy representation stability properties that follow from Koszul duality.</description>

      <title>Computing the unit group of a commutative finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a commutative finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra, i.e., for a commutative ring $R$ whose additive group is finitely generated, it is known that the group of units of $R$ is finitely generated, as well. Our main results are algorithms to compute generators and the structure of this group. This is achieved by reducing the task first to the case of reduced rings, then to torsion-free reduced rings, and finally to an order in a reduced ring. The simplified cases are treated via a calculation of exponent lattices and various algorithms to compute the minimal primes, primitive idempotents, and other basic objects. All algorithms have been implemented and are available as a SageMath package. Whenever possible, the time complexity of the described methods is tracked carefully.</description>

      <title>Quantum group coproducts and universality under scalar extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the families of bialgebras or Hopf algebras over fields for which the product in the corresponding category is finite-dimensional, answering a question of M. Lorenz: if the ground field is infinite then bialgebra or Hopf products are finite-dimensional precisely when the factors are, with at most one of dimension $&gt;1$; over finite fields the necessary and sufficient condition is instead that factors be finite-dimensional with at most finitely many of dimension $&gt;1$; finally, these statements hold for coalgebras as well, provided the family is finite. We also characterize (a) finite field extensions as precisely those whose underlying scalar extension functor preserves coalgebra, or bialgebra, or Hopf algebra products (correcting an error in the literature); (b) algebraic field extensions as those along which finite coalgebra (bialgebra, Hopf algebra) products are preserved; and (c) again algebraic field extensions as precisely those which intertwine cofree coalgebras on vector spaces, or cofree bialgebras (Hopf algebras) on algebras.</description>
