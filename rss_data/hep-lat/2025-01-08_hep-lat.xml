      <title>Quark number susceptibility and conserved charge fluctuation for (2+1)-flavor QCD with M\"obius domain wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present quark number susceptibilities and conserved charge fluctuations for (2+1)-flavor QCD using M\"obius Domain Wall fermions with a pion mass of \(135~\rm{MeV}\). Our results are compared with hadron resonance gas models below the QCD transition temperature and with \(\mathcal{O}(g^2)\) perturbation theory at high temperatures. Additionally, we compare our findings with results from staggered fermion discretizations. Furthermore, we also present results of leading order Kurtosis of electric charge and strangeness fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Lattice Effective Field Theory Simulations of Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice effective field theory applies the principles of effective field theory in a lattice framework where space and time are discretized. Nucleons are placed on the lattice sites, and the interactions are tuned to replicate the observed features of the nuclear force. Monte Carlo simulations are then employed to predict the properties of nuclear few- and many-body systems. We review the basic methods and several theoretical and algorithmic advances that have been used to further our understanding of atomic nuclei.</description>

      <title>QCD with background electromagnetic fields on the lattice: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive summary of results on the physics of strongly interacting matter in the presence of background electromagnetic fields, obtained via numerical lattice simulations of the underlying theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD has guided our understanding of magnetized quarks and gluons via landmark results on the phase diagram, the equation of state, the confinemenent mechanism, anomalous transport phenomena as well as many more fascinating effects. Some of the lattice results lead to completely new paradigms in the description of hot magnetized quark matter and provided useful insights to a broad high-energy particle physics community. Since the first lattice QCD simulations with background fields, this field has been established as an independent research direction. We present the current status and recent developments of this field, together with an outlook including open questions to be answered in the near future.</description>

      <title>Decay properties of light $1^{-+}$ hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the decay properties of the isovector and isoscalar $1^{-+}$ light hybrids, $\pi_1$ and $\eta_1$, in $N_f=2$ lattice QCD at a pion mass $m_\pi \approx 417~\mathrm{MeV}$. The McNeile and Michael method is adopted to extract the effective couplings for individual decay modes, which are used to estimate the partial decay widths of $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ by assuming SU(3) symmetry. The partial decay widths of $\pi_1(1600)$ are predicted to be $(\Gamma_{b_1\pi}, \Gamma_{f_1(1285)\pi}, \Gamma_{\rho\pi}, \Gamma_{K^*\bar{K}}) = (325 \pm 75, \mathcal{O}(10), 52 \pm 7, 8.6 \pm 1.3)~\mathrm{MeV}$, and the total width is estimated to be $396 \pm 90~\mathrm{MeV}$, considering only statistical errors. If $\eta_1(1855)$ and the $4.4\sigma$ signal observed by BESIII (labeled as $\eta_1(2200)$) are taken as the two mass eigenstates of the isoscalar $1^{-+}$ light hybrids in SU(3), then the dominant decay channel(s) of $\eta_1(1855)$ ($\eta_1(2200)$) is $K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ ($K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ and $K_1(1400)\bar{K}$) through the $1^{+(-)}0^{-(+)}$ mode. The vector-vector decay modes are also significant for the two $\eta_1$ states. Using the mixing angle $\alpha \approx 22.7^\circ$ obtained from lattice QCD for the two $\eta_1$ states, the total widths are estimated to be $\Gamma_{\eta_1(1855)}=282(85)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{\eta_1(2200)}=455(143)~\mathrm{MeV}$. The former is compatible with the experimental width of $\eta_1(1855)$. Although many systematic uncertainties are not well controlled, these results are qualitatively informative for the experimental search for light hybrids.</description>

      <title>The isospin-violating part of the hadronic vacuum polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our calculation of the isospin-violating part of the hadronic vacuum polarisation (HVP) contribution to muon $(g-2)$ in lattice QCD at the $SU(3)_{\mathrm{f}}$ symmetric point. The computation of the contributing fully connected diagrams with one internal photon as well as the computation of the only (mass) counterterm are shown. The latter is determined from the charged-neutral kaon mass splitting. We employ coordinate-space methods and a photon propagator which is regulated \`a la Pauli-Villars with a cutoff scale $\Lambda$ well below the lattice cutoff. This regularization makes it possible for us to do crosschecks of individual contributions with calculations in the continuum. Our continuum extrapolated results show little to no dependence on $\Lambda$. This makes our final limit $\Lambda \rightarrow \infty$ straightforward.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Analysis of $B\to K^{(*)}$ and $B_s\to \phi$ Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the first simultaneous dispersive analysis of the $B\to K$, $B\to K^*$, and $B_s\to \phi$ form factors. By means of an improved parametrization, we take into account the form factors' below-threshold branch cuts arising from on-shell $\bar{B}_s \pi^0$ and $\bar{B}_s \pi^0 \pi^0$ states, which so far have been ignored in the literature. In this way, we eliminate a source of hard-to-quantify systematic uncertainties. We provide machine-readable files to obtain the full set of the $\bar{B}\to \bar{K}^{(*)}$ and $\bar{B}_s\to \phi$ form factors in and beyond the entire semileptonic phase space.</description>

      <title>Exponential improvements in the simulation of lattice gauge theories using near-optimal techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a first-of-its-kind analysis on post-Trotter simulation of U(1), SU(2) and SU(3) lattice gauge theories including fermions in arbitrary spatial dimension. We provide explicit circuit constructions as well as T-gate counts and logical qubit counts for Hamiltonian simulation. We find up to 25 orders of magnitude reduction in space-time volume over Trotter methods for simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories relevant to the standard model. This improvement results from our algorithm having polynomial scaling with the number of colors in the gauge theory, achieved by utilizing oracle constructions relying on the sparsity of physical operators, in contrast to the exponential scaling seen in state-of-the-art Trotter methods which employ explicit mappings onto Pauli operators. Our work demonstrates that the use of advanced algorithmic techniques leads to dramatic reductions in the cost of simulating fundamental interactions, bringing it in step with resources required for first principles quantum simulation of chemistry.</description>

      <title>Hunting New Animalcula with Rare K and B Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize the recent strategy for an efficient hunting of new animalcula with the help of rare K and B decays that avoids the use of the $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$ parameters that are subject to tensions between their determinations from inclusive and exclusive decays. In particular we update the values of the $V_{cb}$-independent ratios of various K and B decay branching ratios predicted by the Standard Model. We also stress the usefulness of the $V_{cb}-\gamma$ plots in the search for new physics. We select the magnificant seven among rare K and B decays that should play a leading role in the search for new physics due to their theoretical cleanness: $B^+\to K^+(K^*)\nu\bar\nu$ and $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ measured recently by Belle II and NA62, respectively, $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ investigated by KOTO and also $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $K_S\to\mu^+\mu^-$ measured by the LHCb, CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN. %</description>
