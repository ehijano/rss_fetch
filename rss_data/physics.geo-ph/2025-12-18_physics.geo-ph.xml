      <title>Contemporary Shrinking of Colombia's Highest Mountains: Pico Simon Bolivar and Pico Cristobal Colon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pico Cristobal Colon and Pico Simon Bolivar are the highest peaks in Colombia and were last accurately surveyed in 1939. This historical survey measured Cristobal Colon, Colombia's recognized highpoint, at 5775m and Simon Bolivar at 5773m. Both peaks have permanent icecaps at their summits. For this study, multiple differential GPS units and an Abney level were used to re-survey each peak with sub-meter vertical accuracy. As of December 2024, the elevation of Simon Bolivar was 5720.42m +/- 0.08m and Cristobal Colon was 5712.79m +/- 0.87m. These measurements indicate that the ice caps of both peaks have shrunk dramatically since 1939: Simon Bolivar by 53m and of Cristobal Colon by 62m. Contrary to official recognition, Pico Simon Bolivar is now the highest mountain in Colombia. Increasing local temperatures suggest that the icecap melting of both peaks is due to climate change.</description>
