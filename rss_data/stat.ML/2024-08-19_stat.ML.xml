      <title>Classification of High-dimensional Time Series in Spectral Domain using Explainable Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable classification of time series presents significant challenges in high dimensions. Traditional feature selection methods in the frequency domain often assume sparsity in spectral density matrices (SDMs) or their inverses, which can be restrictive for real-world applications. In this article, we propose a model-based approach for classifying high-dimensional stationary time series by assuming sparsity in the difference between inverse SDMs. Our approach emphasizes the interpretability of model parameters, making it especially suitable for fields like neuroscience, where understanding differences in brain network connectivity across various states is crucial. The estimators for model parameters demonstrate consistency under appropriate conditions. We further propose using standard deep learning optimizers for parameter estimation, employing techniques such as mini-batching and learning rate scheduling. Additionally, we introduce a method to screen the most discriminatory frequencies for classification, which exhibits the sure screening property under general conditions. The flexibility of the proposed model allows the significance of covariates to vary across frequencies, enabling nuanced inferences and deeper insights into the underlying problem. The novelty of our method lies in the interpretability of the model parameters, addressing critical needs in neuroscience. The proposed approaches have been evaluated on simulated examples and the `Alert-vs-Drowsy' EEG dataset.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Transfer Learning via Adversarial Contrastive Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning a data representation for downstream supervised learning tasks under unlabeled scenario is both critical and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised transfer learning approach using adversarial contrastive training (ACT). Our experimental results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy with both fine-tuned linear probe and K-NN protocol across various datasets, showing competitiveness with existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods. Moreover, we provide an end-to-end theoretical guarantee for downstream classification tasks in a misspecified, over-parameterized setting, highlighting how a large amount of unlabeled data contributes to prediction accuracy. Our theoretical findings suggest that the testing error of downstream tasks depends solely on the efficiency of data augmentation used in ACT when the unlabeled sample size is sufficiently large. This offers a theoretical understanding of learning downstream tasks with a small sample size.</description>

      <title>Linear combinations of latents in diffusion models: interpolation and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models are crucial for applications like data synthesis and augmentation. Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on Gaussian latent variables for generation. As any generated object is directly associated with a particular latent variable, we can manipulate the variables to exert control over the generation process. However, standard approaches for combining latent variables, such as spherical interpolation, only apply or work well in special cases. Moreover, current methods for obtaining low-dimensional representations of the data, important for e.g. surrogate models for search and creative applications, are network and data modality specific. In this work we show that the standard methods to combine variables do not yield intermediates following the distribution the models are trained to expect. We propose Combination of Gaussian variables (COG), a novel interpolation method that addresses this, is easy to implement yet matches or improves upon current methods. COG addresses linear combinations in general and, as we demonstrate, also supports other operations including e.g. defining subspaces of the latent space, simplifying the creation of expressive low-dimensional spaces of high-dimensional objects using generative models based on Gaussian latents.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on Bayesian Operational Modal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08664v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of operational modal analysis (OMA), obtained modal information is frequently used to assess the current state of aerospace, mechanical, offshore and civil structures. However, the stochasticity of operational systems and the lack of forcing information can lead to inconsistent results. Quantifying the uncertainty of the recovered modal parameters through OMA is therefore of significant value. In this article, a new perspective on Bayesian OMA is proposed: a Bayesian stochastic subspace identification (SSI) algorithm. Distinct from existing approaches to Bayesian OMA, a hierarchical probabilistic model is embedded at the core of covariance-driven SSI. Through substitution of canonical correlation analysis with a Bayesian equivalent, posterior distributions over the modal properties are obtained. Two inference schemes are presented for the proposed Bayesian formulation: Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes. Two case studies are then explored. The first is benchmark study using data from a simulated, multi degree-of-freedom, linear system. Following application of Bayesian SSI, it is shown that the same posterior is targeted and recovered by both inference schemes, with good agreement between the posterior mean and the conventional SSI result. The second study applies the variational form to data obtained from an in-service structure: The Z24 bridge. The results of this study are presented at single model orders, and then using a stabilisation diagram. The recovered posterior uncertainty is presented and compared to the classic SSI result. It is observed that the posterior distributions with mean values coinciding with the natural frequencies exhibit lower variance than values situated away from the natural frequencies.</description>

      <title>Misclassification excess risk bounds for PAC-Bayesian classification via convexified loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PAC-Bayesian bounds have proven to be a valuable tool for deriving generalization bounds and for designing new learning algorithms in machine learning. However, it typically focus on providing generalization bounds with respect to a chosen loss function. In classification tasks, due to the non-convex nature of the 0-1 loss, a convex surrogate loss is often used, and thus current PAC-Bayesian bounds are primarily specified for this convex surrogate. This work shifts its focus to providing misclassification excess risk bounds for PAC-Bayesian classification when using a convex surrogate loss. Our key ingredient here is to leverage PAC-Bayesian relative bounds in expectation rather than relying on PAC-Bayesian bounds in probability. We demonstrate our approach in several important applications.</description>

      <title>Shapley Marginal Surplus for Strong Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shapley values have seen widespread use in machine learning as a way to explain model predictions and estimate the importance of covariates. Accurately explaining models is critical in real-world models to both aid in decision making and to infer the properties of the true data-generating process (DGP). In this paper, we demonstrate that while model-based Shapley values might be accurate explainers of model predictions, machine learning models themselves are often poor explainers of the DGP even if the model is highly accurate. Particularly in the presence of interrelated or noisy variables, the output of a highly predictive model may fail to account for these relationships. This implies explanations of a trained model's behavior may fail to provide meaningful insight into the DGP. In this paper we introduce a novel variable importance algorithm, Shapley Marginal Surplus for Strong Models, that samples the space of possible models to come up with an inferential measure of feature importance. We compare this method to other popular feature importance methods, both Shapley-based and non-Shapley based, and demonstrate significant outperformance in inferential capabilities relative to other methods.</description>

      <title>Pre-processing and Compression: Understanding Hidden Representation Refinement Across Imaging Domains via Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been interest in how geometric properties such as intrinsic dimension (ID) of a neural network's hidden representations evolve through its layers, and how such properties are predictive of important model behavior such as generalization ability. However, evidence has begun to emerge that such behavior can change significantly depending on the domain of the network's training data, such as natural versus medical images. Here, we further this inquiry by exploring how the ID of a network's learned representations evolves through its layers, in essence, characterizing how the network successively refines the information content of input data to be used for predictions. Analyzing eleven natural and medical image datasets across six network architectures, we find that the shape of this ID evolution curve differs noticeably between natural and medical image models: medical image models peak in representation ID earlier in the network, implying a difference in the image features and their abstractness that are typically used for downstream tasks in these domains. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation of this peak representation ID with the ID of the data in its input space, implying that the intrinsic information content of a model's learned representations is guided by that of the data it was trained on. Overall, our findings emphasize notable discrepancies in network behavior between natural and non-natural imaging domains regarding hidden representation information content, and provide further insights into how a network's learned features are shaped by its training data.</description>

      <title>Oja's plasticity rule overcomes several challenges of training neural networks under biological constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a large literature on the similarities and differences between biological neural circuits and deep artificial neural networks (DNNs). However, modern training of DNNs relies on several engineering tricks such as data batching, normalization, adaptive optimizers, and precise weight initialization. Despite their critical role in training DNNs, these engineering tricks are often overlooked when drawing parallels between biological and artificial networks, potentially due to a lack of evidence for their direct biological implementation. In this study, we show that Oja's plasticity rule partly overcomes the need for some engineering tricks. Specifically, under difficult, but biologically realistic learning scenarios such as online learning, deep architectures, and sub-optimal weight initialization, Oja's rule can substantially improve the performance of pure backpropagation. Our results demonstrate that simple synaptic plasticity rules can overcome challenges to learning that are typically overcome using less biologically plausible approaches when training DNNs.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of price trend trading strategies via image-induced importance weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We open up the "black-box" to identify the predictive general price patterns in price chart images via the deep learning image analysis techniques. Our identified price patterns lead to the construction of image-induced importance (triple-I) weights, which are applied to weighted moving average the existing price trend trading signals according to their level of importance in predicting price movements. From an extensive empirical analysis on the Chinese stock market, we show that the triple-I weighting scheme can significantly enhance the price trend trading signals for proposing portfolios, with a thoughtful robustness study in terms of network specifications, image structures, and stock sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the triple-I weighting scheme is able to propose long-term portfolios from a time-scale transfer learning, enhance the news-based trading strategies through a non-technical transfer learning, and increase the overall strength of numerous trading rules for portfolio selection.</description>

      <title>Fishers Harvest Parallel Unlearning in Inherited Model Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlearning in various learning frameworks remains challenging, with the continuous growth and updates of models exhibiting complex inheritance relationships. This paper presents a novel unlearning framework, which enables fully parallel unlearning among models exhibiting inheritance. A key enabler is the new Unified Model Inheritance Graph (UMIG), which captures the inheritance using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).Central to our framework is the new Fisher Inheritance Unlearning (FIUn) algorithm, which utilizes the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) from initial unlearning models to pinpoint impacted parameters in inherited models. By employing FIM, the FIUn method breaks the sequential dependencies among the models, facilitating simultaneous unlearning and reducing computational overhead. We further design to merge disparate FIMs into a single matrix, synchronizing updates across inherited models. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of our unlearning framework. For single-class tasks, it achieves complete unlearning with 0\% accuracy for unlearned labels while maintaining 94.53\% accuracy for retained labels on average. For multi-class tasks, the accuracy is 1.07\% for unlearned labels and 84.77\% for retained labels on average. Our framework accelerates unlearning by 99\% compared to alternative methods.</description>

      <title>S$^3$Attention: Improving Long Sequence Attention with Smoothed Skeleton Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention based models have achieved many remarkable breakthroughs in numerous applications. However, the quadratic complexity of Attention makes the vanilla Attention based models hard to apply to long sequence tasks. Various improved Attention structures are proposed to reduce the computation cost by inducing low rankness and approximating the whole sequence by sub-sequences. The most challenging part of those approaches is maintaining the proper balance between information preservation and computation reduction: the longer sub-sequences used, the better information is preserved, but at the price of introducing more noise and computational costs. In this paper, we propose a smoothed skeleton sketching based Attention structure, coined S$^3$Attention, which significantly improves upon the previous attempts to negotiate this trade-off. S$^3$Attention has two mechanisms to effectively minimize the impact of noise while keeping the linear complexity to the sequence length: a smoothing block to mix information over long sequences and a matrix sketching method that simultaneously selects columns and rows from the input matrix. We verify the effectiveness of S$^3$Attention both theoretically and empirically. Extensive studies over Long Range Arena (LRA) datasets and six time-series forecasting show that S$^3$Attention significantly outperforms both vanilla Attention and other state-of-the-art variants of Attention structures.</description>

      <title>Explore-then-Commit Algorithms for Decentralized Two-Sided Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online learning in a decentralized two-sided matching markets, where the demand-side (players) compete to match with the supply-side (arms), has received substantial interest because it abstracts out the complex interactions in matching platforms (e.g. UpWork, TaskRabbit). However, past works assume that each arm knows their preference ranking over the players (one-sided learning), and each player aim to learn the preference over arms through successive interactions. Moreover, several (impractical) assumptions on the problem are usually made for theoretical tractability such as broadcast player-arm match Liu et al. (2020; 2021); Kong &amp; Li (2023) or serial dictatorship Sankararaman et al. (2021); Basu et al. (2021); Ghosh et al. (2022). In this paper, we study a decentralized two-sided matching market, where we do not assume that the preference ranking over players are known to the arms apriori. Furthermore, we do not have any structural assumptions on the problem. We propose a multi-phase explore-then-commit type algorithm namely epoch-based CA-ETC (collision avoidance explore then commit) (\texttt{CA-ETC} in short) for this problem that does not require any communication across agents (players and arms) and hence decentralized. We show that for the initial epoch length of $T_{\circ}$ and subsequent epoch-lengths of $2^{l/\gamma} T_{\circ}$ (for the $l-$th epoch with $\gamma \in (0,1)$ as an input parameter to the algorithm), \texttt{CA-ETC} yields a player optimal expected regret of $\mathcal{O}\left(T_{\circ} (\frac{K \log T}{T_{\circ} \Delta^2})^{1/\gamma} + T_{\circ} (\frac{T}{T_{\circ}})^\gamma\right)$ for the $i$-th player, where $T$ is the learning horizon, $K$ is the number of arms and $\Delta$ is an appropriately defined problem gap. Furthermore, we propose a blackboard communication based baseline achieving logarithmic regret in $T$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symmetries in Binary Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of group symmetries in binary classification tasks, presenting a novel framework that leverages the principles of Neyman-Pearson optimality. Contrary to the common intuition that larger symmetry groups lead to improved classification performance, our findings show that selecting the appropriate group symmetries is crucial for optimising generalisation and sample efficiency. We develop a theoretical foundation for designing group equivariant neural networks that align the choice of symmetries with the underlying probability distributions of the data. Our approach provides a unified methodology for improving classification accuracy across a broad range of applications by carefully tailoring the symmetry group to the specific characteristics of the problem. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that optimal classification performance is not always associated with the largest equivariant groups possible in the domain, even when the likelihood ratio is invariant under one of its proper subgroups, but rather with those subgroups themselves. This work offers insights and practical guidelines for constructing more effective group equivariant architectures in diverse machine-learning contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Annotating data for supervised learning can be costly. When the annotation budget is limited, active learning can be used to select and annotate those observations that are likely to give the most gain in model performance. We propose an active learning algorithm that, in addition to selecting which observation to annotate, selects the precision of the annotation that is acquired. Assuming that annotations with low precision are cheaper to obtain, this allows the model to explore a larger part of the input space, with the same annotation budget. We build our acquisition function on the previously proposed BALD objective for Gaussian Processes, and empirically demonstrate the gains of being able to adjust the annotation precision in the active learning loop.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic variable importance for predictive uncertainty: an entropy-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to trust the predictions of a machine learning algorithm, it is necessary to understand the factors that contribute to those predictions. In the case of probabilistic and uncertainty-aware models, it is necessary to understand not only the reasons for the predictions themselves, but also the reasons for the model's level of confidence in those predictions. In this paper, we show how existing methods in explainability can be extended to uncertainty-aware models and how such extensions can be used to understand the sources of uncertainty in a model's predictive distribution. In particular, by adapting permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots, we demonstrate that novel insights into model behaviour may be obtained and that these methods can be used to measure the impact of features on both the entropy of the predictive distribution and the log-likelihood of the ground truth labels under that distribution. With experiments using both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the utility of these approaches to understand both the sources of uncertainty and their impact on model performance.</description>

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a key issue when considering the application of deep neural network methods in science and engineering. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that quantifies epistemic uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling from a tempered posterior distribution. It combines the well established Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) with momentum-based optimization using Adam and leverages a prolate proposal distribution, to efficiently draw from the posterior. We prove that the constructed chain admits the Gibbs posterior as an invariant distribution and converges to this Gibbs posterior in total variation distance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting algorithm and the merit of the proposed changes on a state-of-the-art classifier from high-energy particle physics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Accuracy in Generative Models via Knowledge Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the accuracy of generative models and the impact of knowledge transfer on their generation precision. Specifically, we examine a generative model for a target task, fine-tuned using a pre-trained model from a source task. Building on the "Shared Embedding" concept, which bridges the source and target tasks, we introduce a novel framework for transfer learning under distribution metrics such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This framework underscores the importance of leveraging inherent similarities between diverse tasks despite their distinct data distributions. Our theory suggests that the shared structures can augment the generation accuracy for a target task, reliant on the capability of a source model to identify shared structures and effective knowledge transfer from source to target learning. To demonstrate the practical utility of this framework, we explore the theoretical implications for two specific generative models: diffusion and normalizing flows. The results show enhanced performance in both models over their non-transfer counterparts, indicating advancements for diffusion models and providing fresh insights into normalizing flows in transfer and non-transfer settings. These results highlight the significant contribution of knowledge transfer in boosting the generation capabilities of these models.</description>

      <title>Multi-marginal Schr\"odinger Bridges with Iterative Reference Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practitioners frequently aim to infer an unobserved population trajectory using sample snapshots at multiple time points. For instance, in single-cell sequencing, scientists would like to learn how gene expression evolves over time. But sequencing any cell destroys that cell. So we cannot access any cell's full trajectory, but we can access snapshot samples from many cells. Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to analyze systems with full individual-trajectory access; since here we have only sample snapshots, these methods are inapplicable. The deep learning community has recently explored using Schr\"odinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions to estimate these dynamics. However, these methods either (1) interpolate between just two time points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic within the SB, which is often just set to be Brownian motion. But learning piecewise from adjacent time points can fail to capture long-term dependencies. And practitioners are typically able to specify a model class for the reference dynamic but not the exact values of the parameters within it. So we propose a new method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories from sample snapshots across multiple time points and (2) requires specification only of a class of reference dynamics, not a single fixed one. In particular, we suggest an iterative projection method inspired by Schr\"odinger bridges; we alternate between learning a piecewise SB on the unobserved trajectories and using the learned SB to refine our best guess for the dynamics within the reference class. We demonstrate the advantages of our method via a well-known simulated parametric model from ecology, simulated and real data from systems biology, and real motion-capture data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.07588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning motivated by convolutional neural networks has been highly successful in a range of medical imaging problems like image classification, image segmentation, image synthesis etc. However for validation and interpretability, not only do we need the predictions made by the model but also how confident it is while making those predictions. This is important in safety critical applications for the people to accept it. In this work, we used an encoder decoder architecture based on variational inference techniques for segmenting brain tumour images. We evaluate our work on the publicly available BRATS dataset using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection Over Union (IOU) as the evaluation metrics. Our model is able to segment brain tumours while taking into account both aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty in a principled bayesian manner.</description>

      <title>Distributed Estimation and Inference for Semi-parametric Binary Response Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of modern technology has enabled data collection of unprecedented size, which poses new challenges to many statistical estimation and inference problems. This paper studies the maximum score estimator of a semi-parametric binary choice model under a distributed computing environment without pre-specifying the noise distribution. An intuitive divide-and-conquer estimator is computationally expensive and restricted by a non-regular constraint on the number of machines, due to the highly non-smooth nature of the objective function. We propose (1) a one-shot divide-and-conquer estimator after smoothing the objective to relax the constraint, and (2) a multi-round estimator to completely remove the constraint via iterative smoothing. We specify an adaptive choice of kernel smoother with a sequentially shrinking bandwidth to achieve the superlinear improvement of the optimization error over the multiple iterations. The improved statistical accuracy per iteration is derived, and a quadratic convergence up to the optimal statistical error rate is established. We further provide two generalizations to handle the heterogeneity of datasets and high-dimensional problems where the parameter of interest is sparse.</description>

      <title>Anytime-valid off-policy inference for contextual bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are ubiquitous tools for active sequential experimentation in healthcare and the tech industry. They involve online learning algorithms that adaptively learn policies over time to map observed contexts $X_t$ to actions $A_t$ in an attempt to maximize stochastic rewards $R_t$. This adaptivity raises interesting but hard statistical inference questions, especially counterfactual ones: for example, it is often of interest to estimate the properties of a hypothetical policy that is different from the logging policy that was used to collect the data -- a problem known as ``off-policy evaluation'' (OPE). Using modern martingale techniques, we present a comprehensive framework for OPE inference that relax unnecessary conditions made in some past works, significantly improving on them both theoretically and empirically. Importantly, our methods can be employed while the original experiment is still running (that is, not necessarily post-hoc), when the logging policy may be itself changing (due to learning), and even if the context distributions are a highly dependent time-series (such as if they are drifting over time). More concretely, we derive confidence sequences for various functionals of interest in OPE. These include doubly robust ones for time-varying off-policy mean reward values, but also confidence bands for the entire cumulative distribution function of the off-policy reward distribution. All of our methods (a) are valid at arbitrary stopping times (b) only make nonparametric assumptions, (c) do not require importance weights to be uniformly bounded and if they are, we do not need to know these bounds, and (d) adapt to the empirical variance of our estimators. In summary, our methods enable anytime-valid off-policy inference using adaptively collected contextual bandit data.</description>

      <title>Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP): Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent advances in AI systems solve problems by providing a "scaffolding" program that structures multiple calls to language models (LMs) to generate better outputs. A scaffolding program is written in a programming language such as Python. In this work, we use a language-model-infused scaffolding program to improve itself. We start with a seed "improver" that improves an input program according to a given utility function by querying an LM several times and returning the best solution. We then run this seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream tasks, the resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better performance than its seed improver. A variety of self-improvement strategies are proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves are not altered, this is not full recursive self-improvement. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that a modern language model, GPT-4 in our experiments, is capable of writing code that can call itself to improve itself. We consider concerns around the development of self-improving technologies and evaluate the frequency with which the generated code bypasses a sandbox.</description>

      <title>CeCNN: Copula-enhanced convolutional neural networks in joint prediction of refraction error and axial length based on ultra-widefield fundus images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultra-widefield (UWF) fundus image is an attractive 3D biomarker in AI-aided myopia screening because it provides much richer myopia-related information. Though axial length (AL) has been acknowledged to be highly related to the two key targets of myopia screening, Spherical Equivalence (SE) measurement and high myopia diagnosis, its prediction based on the UWF fundus image is rarely considered. To save the high expense and time costs of measuring SE and AL, we propose the Copula-enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CeCNN), a one-stop UWF-based ophthalmic AI framework to jointly predict SE, AL, and myopia status. The CeCNN formulates a multiresponse regression that relates multiple dependent discrete-continuous responses and the image covariate, where the nonlinearity of the association is modeled by a backbone CNN. To thoroughly describe the dependence structure among the responses, we model and incorporate the conditional dependence among responses in a CNN through a new copula-likelihood loss. We provide statistical interpretations of the conditional dependence among responses, and reveal that such dependence is beyond the dependence explained by the image covariate. We heuristically justify that the proposed loss can enhance the estimation efficiency of the CNN weights. We apply the CeCNN to the UWF dataset collected by us and demonstrate that the CeCNN sharply enhances the predictive capability of various backbone CNNs. Our study evidences the ophthalmology view that besides SE, AL is also an important measure to myopia.</description>

      <title>Spectral Clustering for Discrete Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete distribution is often used to describe complex instances in machine learning, such as images, sequences, and documents. Traditionally, clustering of discrete distributions (D2C) has been approached using Wasserstein barycenter methods. These methods operate under the assumption that clusters can be well-represented by barycenters, which is seldom true in many real-world applications. Additionally, these methods are not scalable for large datasets due to the high computational cost of calculating Wasserstein barycenters. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using spectral clustering combined with distribution affinity measures (e.g., maximum mean discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) to cluster discrete distributions. We demonstrate that these methods can be more accurate and efficient than barycenter methods. To further enhance scalability, we propose using linear optimal transport to construct affinity matrices efficiently for large datasets. We provide theoretical guarantees for the success of our methods in clustering distributions. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that our methods outperform existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Multistatic-Radar RCS-Signature Recognition of Aerial Vehicles: A Bayesian Fusion Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radar Automated Target Recognition (RATR) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) involves transmitting Electromagnetic Waves (EMWs) and performing target type recognition on the received radar echo, crucial for defense and aerospace applications. Previous studies highlighted the advantages of multistatic radar configurations over monostatic ones in RATR. However, fusion methods in multistatic radar configurations often suboptimally combine classification vectors from individual radars probabilistically. To address this, we propose a fully Bayesian RATR framework employing Optimal Bayesian Fusion (OBF) to aggregate classification probability vectors from multiple radars. OBF, based on expected 0-1 loss, updates a Recursive Bayesian Classification (RBC) posterior distribution for target UAV type, conditioned on historical observations across multiple time steps. We evaluate the approach using simulated random walk trajectories for seven drones, correlating target aspect angles to Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements in an anechoic chamber. Comparing against single radar Automated Target Recognition (ATR) systems and suboptimal fusion methods, our empirical results demonstrate that the OBF method integrated with RBC significantly enhances classification accuracy compared to other fusion methods and single radar configurations.</description>

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial task in settings where data is high-dimensional or acquiring the full set of features is costly. Recent developments in neural network-based embedded feature selection show promising results across a wide range of applications. Concrete Autoencoders (CAEs), considered state-of-the-art in embedded feature selection, may struggle to achieve stable joint optimization, hurting their training time and generalization. In this work, we identify that this instability is correlated with the CAE learning duplicate selections. To remedy this, we propose a simple and effective improvement: Indirectly Parameterized CAEs (IP-CAEs). IP-CAEs learn an embedding and a mapping from it to the Gumbel-Softmax distributions' parameters. Despite being simple to implement, IP-CAE exhibits significant and consistent improvements over CAE in both generalization and training time across several datasets for reconstruction and classification. Unlike CAE, IP-CAE effectively leverages non-linear relationships and does not require retraining the jointly optimized decoder. Furthermore, our approach is, in principle, generalizable to Gumbel-Softmax distributions beyond feature selection.</description>

      <title>Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various mechanical failures. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection via Deep Multi-Comprehension Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research underscores the pivotal role of the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) feature representation field scale in determining the efficacy of models in OOD detection. Consequently, the adoption of model ensembles has emerged as a prominent strategy to augment this feature representation field, capitalizing on anticipated model diversity.
  However, our introduction of novel qualitative and quantitative model ensemble evaluation methods, specifically Loss Basin/Barrier Visualization and the Self-Coupling Index, reveals a critical drawback in existing ensemble methods. We find that these methods incorporate weights that are affine-transformable, exhibiting limited variability and thus failing to achieve the desired diversity in feature representation.
  To address this limitation, we elevate the dimensions of traditional model ensembles, incorporating various factors such as different weight initializations, data holdout, etc., into distinct supervision tasks. This innovative approach, termed Multi-Comprehension (MC) Ensemble, leverages diverse training tasks to generate distinct comprehensions of the data and labels, thereby extending the feature representation field.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the MC Ensemble strategy in OOD detection compared to both the naive Deep Ensemble method and a standalone model of comparable size. This underscores the effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing the model's capability to detect instances outside its training distribution.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Active Subspaces to Capture Epistemic Model Uncertainty in Deep Generative Models for Molecular Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have been accelerating the inverse design process in material and drug design. Unlike their counterpart property predictors in typical molecular design frameworks, generative molecular design models have seen fewer efforts on uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to computational challenges in Bayesian inference posed by their large number of parameters. In this work, we focus on the junction-tree variational autoencoder (JT-VAE), a popular model for generative molecular design, and address this issue by leveraging the low dimensional active subspace to capture the uncertainty in the model parameters. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the active subspace parameters to estimate the epistemic model uncertainty in an extremely high dimensional parameter space. The proposed UQ scheme does not require alteration of the model architecture, making it readily applicable to any pre-trained model. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the AS-based UQ and its potential impact on molecular optimization by exploring the model diversity under epistemic uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models recently proved to be remarkable priors for Bayesian inverse problems. However, training these models typically requires access to large amounts of clean data, which could prove difficult in some settings. In this work, we present a novel method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm for training diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations only. Unlike previous works, our method leads to proper diffusion models, which is crucial for downstream tasks. As part of our method, we propose and motivate an improved posterior sampling scheme for unconditional diffusion models. We present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Score Function Estimators for $k$-Subset Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16058</link>

Abstract: Are score function estimators an underestimated approach to learning with $k$-subset sampling? Sampling $k$-subsets is a fundamental operation in many machine learning tasks that is not amenable to differentiable parametrization, impeding gradient-based optimization. Prior work has focused on relaxed sampling or pathwise gradient estimators. Inspired by the success of score function estimators in variational inference and reinforcement learning, we revisit them within the context of $k$-subset sampling. Specifically, we demonstrate how to efficiently compute the $k$-subset distribution's score function using a discrete Fourier transform, and reduce the estimator's variance with control variates. The resulting estimator provides both exact samples and unbiased gradient estimates while also applying to non-differentiable downstream models, unlike existing methods. Experiments in feature selection show results competitive with current methods, despite weaker assumptions.</description>

      <title>Peer-induced Fairness: A Causal Approach for Algorithmic Fairness Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the EU AI Act effective from 1 August 2024, high-risk applications like credit scoring must adhere to stringent transparency and quality standards, including algorithmic fairness evaluations. Consequently, developing tools for auditing algorithmic fairness has become crucial. This paper addresses a key question: how can we scientifically audit algorithmic fairness? It is vital to determine whether adverse decisions result from algorithmic discrimination or the subjects' inherent limitations. We introduce a novel auditing framework, ``peer-induced fairness'', leveraging counterfactual fairness and advanced causal inference techniques within credit approval systems. Our approach assesses fairness at the individual level through peer comparisons, independent of specific AI methodologies. It effectively tackles challenges like data scarcity and imbalance, common in traditional models, particularly in credit approval. Model-agnostic and flexible, the framework functions as both a self-audit tool for stakeholders and an external audit tool for regulators, offering ease of integration. It also meets the EU AI Act's transparency requirements by providing clear feedback on whether adverse decisions stem from personal capabilities or discrimination. We demonstrate the framework's usefulness by applying it to SME credit approval, revealing significant bias: 41.51% of micro-firms face discrimination compared to non-micro firms. These findings highlight the framework's potential for diverse AI applications.</description>

      <title>Kernel Density Estimators in Large Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Kernel density estimation for a high-dimensional distribution $\rho(x)$. Traditional approaches have focused on the limit of large number of data points $n$ and fixed dimension $d$. We analyze instead the regime where both the number $n$ of data points $y_i$ and their dimensionality $d$ grow with a fixed ratio $\alpha=(\log n)/d$. Our study reveals three distinct statistical regimes for the kernel-based estimate of the density $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)=\frac{1}{n h^d}\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{x-y_i}{h}\right)$, depending on the bandwidth $h$: a classical regime for large bandwidth where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds, which is akin to the one found in traditional approaches. Below a certain value of the bandwidth, $h_{CLT}(\alpha)$, we find that the CLT breaks down. The statistics of $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ for a fixed $x$ drawn from $\rho(x)$ is given by a heavy-tailed distribution (an alpha-stable distribution). In particular below a value $h_G(\alpha)$, we find that $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ is governed by extreme value statistics: only a few points in the database matter and give the dominant contribution to the density estimator. We provide a detailed analysis for high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian data. We show that the optimal bandwidth threshold based on Kullback-Leibler divergence lies in the new statistical regime identified in this paper. Our findings reveal limitations of classical approaches, show the relevance of these new statistical regimes, and offer new insights for Kernel density estimation in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in climate projections with conformal ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large climate model ensembles are the primary tool for robustly projecting future climate states and quantifying projection uncertainty. Despite significant advancements in climate modeling over the past few decades, overall projection certainty has not commensurately decreased with steadily improving model skill. We introduce conformal ensembling, a new approach to uncertainty quantification in climate projections based on conformal inference to reduce projection uncertainty. Unlike traditional methods, conformal ensembling seamlessly integrates climate model ensembles and observational data across a range of scales to generate statistically rigorous, easy-to-interpret uncertainty estimates. It can be applied to any climatic variable using any ensemble analysis method and outperforms existing inter-model variability methods in uncertainty quantification across all time horizons and most spatial locations under SSP2-4.5. Conformal ensembling is also computationally efficient, requires minimal assumptions, and is highly robust to the conformity measure. Experiments show that it is effective when conditioning future projections on historical reanalysis data compared with standard ensemble averaging approaches, yielding more physically consistent projections.</description>
