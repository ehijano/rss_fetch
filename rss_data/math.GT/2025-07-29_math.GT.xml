      <title>Flexible hyperbolic cone metrics on the genus 2 surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A negatively curved hyperbolic cone metric on a surface is rigid if it is determined by the support of its Liouville current. We use a theorem of Erlandsson, Leininger, and Sadanand to show that there are nine mapping class group orbits of equivalence classes of non-rigid (aka flexible) metrics in the case of the genus 2 surface.</description>

      <title>Bounded volume class and Cheeger isoperimetric constant for negatively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for strictly negatively curved manifolds of infinite volume and bounded geometry, the bounded fundamental class, defined via integration of the volume form over straight top-dimensional simplices, vanishes if and only if the Cheeger isoperimetric constant is positive. This gives a partial affirmative answer to a conjecture of Kim and Kim. Furthermore, we show that for all strictly negatively curved manifolds of infinite volume, the positivity of the Cheeger constant implies the vanishing of the bounded volume class, solving one direction of the conjecture in full generality.</description>

      <title>Biquandle cocycle condition for invariants of immersed surface-links in the four-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a biquandle-cohomological framework for invariants of oriented immersed surface-links in the four-space. After reviewing projections and Roseman moves for immersed surfaces, we prove that the move types (a,b,c,e,f,g,h) form a minimal generating set, showing in particular that the singular move (h) is independent of the embedded-case set (a,b,c,e,f,g). We extend biquandle colorings to broken surface diagrams with singular points and establish that coloring sets are in bijection for diagrams related by these moves, yielding a coloring number invariant for immersed surface-links. We introduce singular biquandle 3-cocycles: biquandle 3-cocycles satisfying an additional antisymmetry when the singular relations hold. Using such cocycles, we define a triple-point state-sum with Boltzmann weights and prove its invariance under all generating moves, including (h), thereby obtaining a state-sum invariant for immersed surface-links. The theory is illustrated on the Fenn-Rolfsen link example, where a computation yields non-trivial value, demonstrating nontriviality of the invariant in the immersed setting. These results unify and extend biquandle cocycle invariants from embedded to immersed surface-links.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a knot to be $\gamma_0$-sharp if its Seifert genus is detected by the concordance invariant $\gamma_0$, which arises from the immersed curve formalism in bordered Heegaard Floer homology. We show that a connected sum of $\gamma_0$-sharp fibered knots is ribbon exactly when it is of the form $K \mathbin{\#} -K$. Consequently, either iterated cables of tight fibered knots are linearly independent in the smooth concordance group, or the slice--ribbon conjecture fails.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy slopes, boundary slopes and exceptional surgery slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an upper bound on the distance between a degeneracy slope for a very full essential lamination and a boundary slope of an essential surface embedded in a compact, orientable, irreducible, atoroidal 3-manifold with incompressible torus boundary. There are three applications: (i) We show that a degeneracy slope for a very full essential lamination in the exterior of a prime alternating knot is meridional. This gives an affirmative answer to part of a conjecture posed by Gabai and Kazez. (ii) We obtain two bounds on boundary slopes for a hyperbolic knot in an integral homology sphere, at least one of which always holds: one concerning the denominators of boundary slopes, and the other concerning the differences between boundary slopes. This generalizes a result on Montesinos knots obtained by the author and Mizushima. (iii) We obtain two bounds on exceptional surgery slopes for a hyperbolic knot in an integral homology sphere, at least one of which always holds: one concerning the denominators of such slopes, and the other concerning their range in terms of the genera of the knots. Both are actually conjectured by Gordon and Teragaito to always hold for hyperbolic knots in the 3-sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sequences of modular representations of the symplectic and special linear groups over finite fields obtained from the first homology of congruence subgroups of mapping class groups and automorphism groups of free groups, and the module of coinvariants for the abelianization of the Torelli group. In all cases we compute the composition factors and multiplicities for these representations, and obtain periodic representation stability results in the sense of Church--Farb.</description>

      <title>Geometric considerations for energy minimization of topological links and chainmail networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knot and link energies can be computed from sets of closed curves in three dimensional space, and each type of knot or link has a minimum energy associated with it. Here, we consider embeddings of links that locally or globally minimize the M\"obius and Minimum Distance energies. By describing these energies as functions of a small number of free parameters, we can find configurations that minimize the energies with respect to these parameters. It has previous been demonstrated that such minimizers exist, but the specific embeddings have not necessarily been found. We find the geometries leading to minimal configurations of Hopf links and Borromean rings, as well as more complex structures such as chain links and chainmails. We find that scale-invariant properties of these energies can lead to ``non-physical'' minimizers, e.g. that a linear chain of Hopf links will subtend a finite length as its crossing number diverges. This incidentally allows us to derive a conjectural improved universal lower bound for the ropelength of knots and links. We also show that Japanese-style square chainmail networks are more efficient, in terms of excess energy, than square lattice ``4-in-1'' chainmail networks.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis and Topological Deep Learning Beyond Persistent Homology - A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly evolving field in applied mathematics and data science that leverages tools from topology to uncover robust, shape-driven insights in complex datasets. The main workhorse is persistent homology, a technique rooted in algebraic topology. Paired with topological deep learning (TDL) or topological machine learning, persistent homology has achieved tremendous success in a wide variety of applications in science, engineering, medicine, and industry. However, persistent homology has many limitations due to its high-level abstraction, insensitivity to non-topological changes, and reliance on point cloud data. This paper presents a comprehensive review of TDA and TDL beyond persistent homology. It analyzes how persistent topological Laplacians and Dirac operators provide spectral representations to capture both topological invariants and homotopic evolution. Other formulations are presented in terms of sheaf theory, Mayer topology, and interaction topology. For data on differentiable manifolds, techniques rooted in differential topology, such as persistent de Rham cohomology, persistent Hodge Laplacian, and Hodge decomposition, are reviewed. For one-dimensional (1D) curves embedded in 3-space, approaches from geometric topology are discussed, including multiscale Gauss-link integrals, persistent Jones polynomials, and persistent Khovanov homology. This paper further discusses the appropriate selection of topological tools for different input data, such as point clouds, sequential data, data on manifolds, curves embedded in 3-space, and data with additional non-geometric information. A review is also given of various topological representations, software packages, and machine learning vectorizations. Finally, this review ends with concluding remarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Benoist-Hulin group is, by definition, a subgroup $\Gamma$ of ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ such that any $\Gamma$-invariant closed set consisting of Jordan curves in the space of closed subsets of the Riemann sphere that are not singletons is composed of $K$-quasicircles for some $K \ge 1$. Y.Benoist and D.Hulin showed that the full group ${\rm PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ is a Benoist-Hulin group. In this paper, we develop the theory of Benoist-Hulin groups and show that both uniform lattices and parabolic subgroups are Benoist-Hulin groups.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the Poisson integral formula for bounded pluriharmonic functions on the Teichm\"uller space of analytically finite Riemann surfaces of type $(g,m)$ with $2g-2+m&gt;0$. We also discuss a version of the F. and M. Riesz theorem concerning the value distribution of plurisubharmonic functions on the Teichm\"uller space, as well as a Teichm\"uller-theoretic interpretation of the mean value theorem for pluriharmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Finite generation of abelianizations of the genus 3 Johnson kernel and the commutator subgroup of the Torelli group for $\mathrm{Out}(F_3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_g^b$ be a compact oriented surface of genus $g$ with $b$ boundary components, where $b\in\{0,1\}$. The Johnson kernel $\mathcal{K}_g^b$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g^b)$ generated by Dehn twists about separating simple closed curves. Let $F_n$ be a free group with $n$ generators. The Torelli group for $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ is the subgroup $\mathrm{IO}_n\subset\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ consisting of all outer automorphisms that act trivially on the abelianization of $F_n$. Long standing questions are whether the groups $\mathcal{K}_g^b$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_n,\mathrm{IO}_n]$ or their abelianizations $(\mathcal{K}_g^b)^{\mathrm{ab}}$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_n,\mathrm{IO}_n]^{\mathrm{ab}}$ are finitely generated for $g\ge3$ (respectively, $n\ge3$). During the last 15 years, these questions were answered positively for $g\ge4$ and $n\ge4$, respectively. Nevertheless, the cases of $g=3$ and $n=3$ remained completely unsettled. In this paper, we prove that the abelianizations $(\mathcal{K}_3^b)^{\mathrm{ab}}$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_3,\mathrm{IO}_3]^{\mathrm{ab}}$ are finitely generated. Our approach is based on a new general sufficient condition for a module over a Laurent polynomial ring to be finitely generated as an abelian group.</description>

Abstract: A key question for $4$-manifolds $M$ admitting symplectic structures is to determine which cohomology classes $\alpha\in H^2(M,\mathbb R)$ admit a symplectic representative. The collection of all such classes, the symplectic cone $\mathcal C_M$, is a basic smooth invariant of $M$. This paper describes the symplectic cone for elliptic surfaces without multiple fibers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every geodesic current on a hyperbolic surface has an associated dual space. If the current is a lamination, this dual embeds isometrically into a real tree. We show that, in general, the dual space is a Gromov hyperbolic metric tree-graded space, and express its Gromov hyperbolicity constant in terms of the geodesic current. In the case of geodesic currents with no atoms and full support, such as those coming from certain higher rank representations, we show the duals are homeomorphic to the surface. We also analyze the completeness of the dual and the properties of the action of the fundamental group of the surface on the dual. Furthermore, we compare two natural topologies in the space of duals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general diagrammatic theory of welded graphs, and provide an extension of Satoh's Tube map from welded graphs to ribbon surface-links. As a topological application, we obtain a complete link-homotopy classification of so-called knotted punctured spheres in $4$-space, by means of the $4$-dimensional Milnor invariants introduced previously by the authors. On the algebraic side, we show that the theory of welded graphs can be reinterpreted as a theory of Wirtinger group presentations, up to a natural set of transformations; these groups arise as the fundamental group of the exterior of the surface-link obtained from the given welded graph by the extended Tube map. Finally, we address the injectivity question for the Tube map, identifying a new family of local moves on welded links, called $\Upsilon$ moves, under which the (non extended) Tube map is invariant.</description>

      <title>Random quotients of mapping class groups are quasi-isometrically rigid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove several rigidity properties for random quotients of mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces, namely whose kernel is normally generated by random walks. Firstly, every automorphism of the corresponding quotient of the curve graph is induced by a mapping class, thus generalising a celebrated theorem of Ivanov's. Next, we show that, if a finitely generated group is quasi-isometric to one such random quotient, then the two groups are weakly commensurable. This uses techniques from the world of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, and indeed in the process we clarify a proof of Behrstock, Hagen, and Sisto on the quasi-isometric rigidity of mapping class groups. Finally, we show that the automorphisms groups of our quotients, as well as their abstract commensurators, coincide with the groups themselves. Our results hold for a wider family of quotients, roughly those whose kernel act by sufficiently large translations on the curve graph. This class also includes quotients by suitable powers of a pseudo-Anosov element.</description>

Geodesic flows on these quotients are a model case of hyperbolic dynamical systems with different expansion/contraction rates in different directions. We show that the support of any semiclassical measure is either equal to the entire cosphere bundle or contains the cosphere bundle of a compact immersed totally geodesic complex submanifold.
  The proof uses the one-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Bourgain-Dyatlov [arXiv:1612.09040] along the fast expanding/contracting directions, in a way similar to the work of Dyatlov-J\'ez\'equel [arXiv:2108.10463] in the toy model of quantum cat maps, together with a description of the closures of fast unstable/stable trajectories relying on Ratner theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a random graph model $\mathcal{F}_{\chi,n}$, which is a configuration model consisting of interior and boundary vertices. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues for graphs in $\mathcal{F}_{\chi,n}$ under various growth regimes of $\chi$ and $n$. When $n = o\left(\chi^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)$, we prove that almost every graph in the model is connected and forms an expander family. We also establish upper bounds for the first Steklov eigenvalue, identifying scenarios in which expanders cannot be constructed. Furthermore, we explicitly construct an expanding family in the critical regime $n \asymp g$, and apply it to build a sequence of complete, noncompact hyperbolic surfaces with uniformly positive spectral gaps.</description>
