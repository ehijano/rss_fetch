      <title>Majorana polarization in disordered heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies propose Majorana polarization (MP) as a tool for identifying topological Majorana bound states (MBS). We analyze MP in two systems: a one-dimensional (1d) semiconducting nanowire and a finite-size graphene strip, both with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, proximity-induced superconductivity, and disorder. While MP reflects topological features, it does not always distinguish true MBS from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or quasi-Majorana modes. True MBS are expected to satisfy $\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{left} \cdot \mathcal{P}^\mathrm{right} \sim -1$, but two additional criteria - a topological bandgap and edge-localized wavefunctions - are also necessary for their identification and use in topological quantum computation (TQC). We highlight cases where the polarization product condition holds without meeting these extra requirements. In finite graphene strips, disorder blurs the complex topological phase diagram, with isolated regions showing $\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{right}\approx-\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{left}$ and $|\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{left}|\gtrsim \frac{1}{2}$. Even here, MP alone cannot reliably distinguish true MBS from quasi-Majorana or trivial states. Robust MBS identification for TQC demands combining MP with energy spectra and wavefunction localization, especially in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Heat-to-motion conversion for quantum active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of an active quantum particle and discuss its properties. The particle has a set of internal states that mediate exchanges of heat with external reservoirs. Heat is then converted into motion by means of a spin-orbit term that couples internal and translational degrees of freedom. The quantum features of the active particle manifest both in the motion and in the heat-to-motion conversion. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of heat exchanges impacts the motion of the active particle and fluctuations can be orders of magnitude larger than the average values. The combination of spin-orbit interaction under nonequilibrium driving may bring active matter into the realm of cold atomic gases where our proposal can be implemented.</description>

      <title>Orbital Longitudinal Magneto-electric Coupling in Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-electric coupling enables the manipulation of magnetization by electric fields and vice versa. While typically found in heavy element materials with large spin-orbit coupling, recent experiments on rhombohedral-stacked pentalayer graphene (RPG) have demonstrated a {\it longitudinal magneto-electric coupling} (LMC) without spin-orbit coupling. Here we present a microscopic theory of LMC in multilayer graphene and identify how it is controlled by a ``layer-space'' quantum geometry and interaction-driven valley polarization. Strikingly, we find that the interplay between valley-polarized order and LMC produces a butterfly shaped magnetic hysteresis controlled by out-of-plane electric field: a signature of LMC and a multiferroic valley order. Furthermore, we identify a nonlinear LMC in multilayer graphene under time-reversal symmetry, while the absence of centrosymmetry enables the generation of a second-order nonlinear electric dipole moment in response to an out-of-plane magnetic field. Our theoretical framework provides a quantitative understanding of LMC, as well as the emergent magneto-electric properties of multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented Spin-Lifetime of Itinerant Electrons in Natural Graphite Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long spin-lifetime of electrons is the holy grail of spintronics, a field exploiting the electron angular momentum as information carrier and storage unit. Previous reports indicated a spin lifetime, $\tau_{\text{s}}$ near $10$ ns at best in graphene-based devices at low temperatures. We detail the observation of $\tau_{\text{s}}$ approaching the ultralong $1{,}000$~ns at room temperature in natural graphite crystals using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The relaxation time shows a giant anisotropy: the lifetime of spins, polarized perpendicular to the graphite plane, is more than $50$ times longer than for the in-plane polarization. The temperature dependence of $\tau_{\text{s}}$ proves that diffusion of spins to the crystallite edges, where relaxation occurs, limits the lifetime. This suggests that graphite is an excellent candidate for spintronic applications, seamlessly integrating with emerging 2D van der Waals technologies.</description>

      <title>Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice is a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials has remained a significant challenge. Here we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the synthesis of single-atomic-layer goldene with a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS), alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide direct evidence of kagome goldene, which exhibits a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, indicative of strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band breaks down at the zigzag edges of the goldene nanoflakes, underlining the role of edge effects. Additionally, our calculations reveal that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the Au$_2$Ge substrate give rise to dual Dirac nodal lines due to a proximity effect. These findings offer a strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices and provide a generalizable approach for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This work paves the way for exploring quantum phases driven by strong correlations and designing materials for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Orbital Magnetization as the Origin of the Nonlinear Hall Effect and Its Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect is a new type of Hall effect that has recently attracted significant attention. For the physical origin of the nonlinear Hall effect, while orbital magnetization has long been hypothesized to underpin the nonlinear Hall effect, quantitative connections between the two remain elusive. Here, we resolve the problem by deriving the first explicit formula connecting the electric field induced orbital magnetization to the second order nonlinear Hall conductivity. Our theory reveals that the applied electric field plays dual roles in generating the nonlinear Hall effect: it first generates nonequlibrium orbital magnetization and subsequently perturbs the circulating edge states to produce transverse Hall voltage. Based on this scenario, we point out that in isotropic chiral metals of T and O point groups, although the nonlinear Hall response of a monochromatic linear polarized electric field is forced to vanish due to the crystalline symmetry, applying a non-collinear bichromatic electric field can give rise to a nonvanishing nonlinear Hall current that directly manifests the chiral correlation of the applied electric field. This discovery in isotropic chiral crystals enables us to incoporate both the nonlinear Hall effect and the circulat photo-galvanic effect into the framework of orbital magnetization.</description>

      <title>Observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear thermoelectric effect is a key factor for realising unconventional thermoelectric phenomena, such as heat rectification and power generation using thermal fluctuations. Recent theoretical advances have indicated that chiral materials can host a variety of exotic nonlinear thermoelectric transport arising from inversion-symmetry breaking. However, experimental demonstration has yet to be achieved. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric Hall effect in chiral tellurium at room temperature, where a voltage is generated as a cross product of the temperature gradient and electric field. The resulting thermoelectric Hall voltage is on the order of {\mu}V, consistent with the prediction from the ab initio calculation. Furthermore, the sign of the thermoelectric Hall voltage is reversed depending on the crystal chirality, demonstrating a novel functionality of sign control of the thermoelectric effect by the chirality degrees of freedom. Our findings reveal the potential of chiral systems as nonlinear thermoelectric materials for advanced thermal management and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Linear Response Conductance of Metallic Single Electron Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the linear-response conductance of a metallic single-electron pump using the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) method. The Coulomb oscillations of the conductance are calculated to illustrate the influence of the Coulomb blockade effect on the system. Furthermore, the experimental conductance is compared with the calculated conductance of various gate voltage configurations and temperatures. The results are consistent even in the low-temperature regime, where significant quantum fluctuation occurs, and the semiclassical approximation fails. Consequently, the present investigation replicates the success of the PIMC approach while precisely describing the quantum fluctuation phenomena of single-electron devices.</description>

      <title>Image-potential states on a 2D Gr-ferromagnet hybrid: enhancing spin and stacking sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy studies of image-potential states on Gr/Fe/Ir(111) show their sensitivity to the spatial variation of the Gr-Fe distance, and of the interfacial charge and spin transfer within the moir\'e unit cell. A stacking contrast between fcc and hcp sites, indistinguishable in the direct tunneling mode, is provided by the image-potential states in both resonant tunneling topography and spectroscopy images. The spin-polarized measurements reveal a site- and energy-dependent spin-polarization of the image-potential states that is mapped across the moir\'e unit cell with a spin contrast between hcp and fcc sites unobservable in direct tunneling mode. On the on-top sites, the lowest image-potential states are found to exhibit a high spin-polarization, in contrast to the electronic states around the Fermi energy evanescent into vacuum, and attributed to their interfacial character at the respective Gr-Fe distance. Since the physisorbed graphene is only weakly spin-polarized on these sites, image-potential states reflect the spin density at buried interfaces covered by non-magnetic passivation layers. The simultaneous imaging of structural, electronic and magnetic properties, both at the surface and the buried interface will prove invaluable in research of 2D hybrids and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Geometry and Non-Abelian Gauge Fields to Aharonov-Bohm Scattering of Massless Fermions in Graphene with Disclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the effect of disclinations on the scattering of quasipaticles in graphene with the presence of a topological defect. Using the tight-binding method, the electronic properties of graphene with disclination are described, where the topological defects are introduced in the lattice via geometric theory. The massless Dirac equation is modified to account for the curvature induced by these defects, incorporating a gauge field. The results show that disclinations significantly affect the scattering process, altering phase shifts and interference patterns. The differential cross-section and its dependence on the scattering angle are analyzed, highlighting the role of geometric factors like the parameter {\alpha} in shaping the scattering dynamics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ordering in out-of-plane artificial spin systems based on the Archimedean lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin systems, sometimes referred to as artificial spin ices, are arrays of coupled nanoscale magnets that order according to the lattice geometry, nanomagnet shape and magnetic anisotropy. Here we characterize a family of artificial spin systems that are formed by placing arrays of out-of-plane nanomagnets on the vertices of the Archimedean lattices. On demagnetizing these nanomagnet arrays using a magnetic field protocol and subsequently imaging the magnetic configuration using magnetic force microscopy, we observe different types of magnetic order. We compare our experimental results with those predicted by Monte Carlo simulations to assign an effective temperature to each lattice. We find that, for all of the lattices, the assigned effective temperature is above the transition temperature. This reflects the difficulty of obtaining system-spanning order in lattices with out-of-plane nanomagnets. We consider to what extent further-neighbor interactions affect the phase diagram and spin-spin correlations in each lattice, illustrating our results with four example lattices. We can divide the lattices into three main categories: bipartite lattices that admit a perfect antiferromagnetic ground state, frustrated lattices where ordering proceeds via a single step, and frustrated lattices with two-step-ordering. Our work highlights the diversity of magnetic ordering that can be hosted in two-dimensional artificial spin systems with out-of-plane nanomagnets, and demonstrates the importance of including long-range interactions to explain the magnetic ordering. Such insights will be important for incorporating artificial spin systems into novel computing applications.</description>

      <title>XY-like Incommensurate Magnetic Order in Ce$_2$SnS$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of single crystals of Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ through a two-stage chemical vapor transport method. The Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ system is a member of the orthorhombic $Pbam$ (No. 55) space group and realizes a distorted trigonal tricapped prism (TTP) crystal field around each cerium site. We characterized the sample through orientation-dependent magnetization and heat capacity measurements to probe the magnetic anisotropy in the system characteristic of XY-like anisotropic Heisenberg model behavior. Ce$_2$SnS$_5$ furthermore enters a zero-field ordered phase under $T_N =$ 2.4 K; powder neutron diffraction measurements reveal incommensurate magnetic order near $T_N$. The system locks into a commensurate structure with a $(q_x, q_y, q_z) = (1/3,0,0)$ propagation vector below approximately 1.2 K.</description>

      <title>Non-magnetic Fractional Conductance in High Mobility InAs Quantum Point Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we report the magneto-electronic properties of high mobility InAs quantum point contacts grown on InP substrates. The 1D conductance reaches a maximum value of 17 plateaus, quantized in units of 2e^2/h, where e is the fundamental unit of charge and h is Planck's constant. The in-plane effective g-factor was estimated to be -10.9 +/- 1.5 for subband N = 1 and -10.8 +/- 1.6 for subband N = 2. Furthermore, a study of the non-magnetic fractional conductance states at 0.2 (e^2/h) and 0.1(e2/h is provided. While their origin remains under discussion, evidence suggests that they arise from strong electron-electron interactions and momentum-conserving backscattering between electrons in two distinct channels within the 1D region. This phenomenon may also be interpreted as an entanglement between the two channel directions facilitated by momentum-conserving backscattering.</description>

      <title>Spin wave eigenmodes in nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key enablers of spintronic technologies used in a variety of applications including information storage, microwave generation and detection, as well as unconventional computing. Here, we present experimental and theoretical studies of quantized spin wave eigenmodes in perpendicular MTJs focusing on a coupled magnetization dynamics in the free (FL) and reference (RL) layers of the MTJ, where the RL is a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF). Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements reveal excitation of two spin wave eigenmodes in response to applied microwave current. These modes show opposite frequency shifts as a function of out-of-plane magnetic field. Our micromagnetic simulations accurately reproduce the dependence of the mode frequencies on magnetic field and reveal the spatial profiles of the excitations in the FL and RL. The FL and RL modes generate rectified voltage signals of opposite polarity, which makes this device a promising candidate for a tunable dual-frequency microwave signal detector. The simulations show that weak interlayer exchange coupling within the SAF enhances the mode amplitudes. We also calculate the response of the detector as a function of in-plane magnetic field bias and find that its sensitivity significantly increases with increasing field. We experimentally confirm this prediction via ST-FMR measurements as a function of in-plane magnetic field. Our results provide deeper understanding of quantized spin wave eigenmodes in nanoscale MTJs with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and demonstrate the potential of these devices for frequency-selective dual-channel microwave signal detectors.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a topotactic transformation of zincblende InAs(Sb) nanowires into the Zintl phase Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$ through a vapor-solid mutual exchange process involving Eu and In in molecular beam epitaxy. This conversion preserves the polyhedral coordination lattice of the parent InAs(Sb) structure while inducing orthorhombic symmetry in the product phase, Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$, in which quasi-one-dimensional [InAs$_3$]$^6$$^-$ chains with tetrahedral sites align along the &lt;110&gt; direction of the zincblende structure. Local and global magnetic characterization identified two distinct antiferromagnetic phase transitions at approximately 7 K and 16 K in Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$ nanowires, potentially classified as altermagnetic phases. The versatility of the topotactic conversion of III-V semiconductor nanowires provides a platform for designing functional Zintl materials with tunable magnetic properties, making them promising candidates for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

      <title>Purely Electronic Model for Exciton-Polaron Formation in Moir\'e Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding interactions between excitons and correlated electronic states presents a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics. Here, we introduce a purely electronic model for the formation of exciton-polarons in moir\'e lattices. Unlike conventional approaches that treat excitons as tightly-bound bosonic particles, our model considers only electronic degrees of freedom, describing excitons as electron-hole bound states. Our findings reveal a pronounced renormalization of the polaron mass as a function of electron density, particularly near correlated insulators, consistent with recent transport experiments. Additionally, we predict an observable sign change in the effective polaron mass when increasing the electron density that can be measured in Hall-type experiments. Our purely electronic model provides a unified framework to investigate the formation and renormalization of exciton-polarons in correlated states.</description>

      <title>The Low-Temperature Phenomenology of Gap Inhomogeneity in the Cuprate Superconductors: High-Energy Granularity, Low-Energy Homogeneity, and Spectral Kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on a number of cuprate superconductors have revealed that these materials are highly inhomogeneous. However, even though this inhomogeneity is well-characterized experimentally, a theoretical understanding of the effect of an inhomogeneous superconducting $d$-wave order parameter on various observables is still not complete. Here, we focus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting order-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches tiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value of the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to study how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various measures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the length scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting coherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous. However, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length, we find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the low-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly inhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating the homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap extracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find in both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower than that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of the patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment on the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations of the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field correlation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Cauchy-Schwarz bound on the accuracy of truncated models in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality provides a simple yet general bound that limits the accuracy of light-matter theories which retain only finite numbers of material energy levels. A corollary is that unitary rotations within a truncated space cannot transform between gauges, because the contrary assumption yields incorrect predictions. In particular, a widespread model obtained using such a rotation and treated as a Coulomb gauge model within a substantial body of literature, yields incorrect predictions under this assumption. The simplest system of a single dipole coupled to a single photonic mode in one spatial dimension is analysed in detail.</description>

      <title>Intersubband optical absorption in the GaN/AlN qunatum wire with donor-doping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the optical absorption within the conduction-subbands of a cylindrical GaN/AlN quantum wire. We analyze the optical absorption rate and the real part of the dielectric function for both quantum wire (QWR) and quantum dot (QD) structures in the presence of donor-impurity states. The results cover that the density of states associated with free motion in the QWR structure leads to a lower optical absorption compared to the QDs, as evidenced by the optical spectra. This study advances the understanding of GaN/AlN heterostructures by offering a comprehensive analysis of the optical properties of QWRs and QDs, especially under donor-doping situation. As a result, the outcomes provide a clear evidence of the effect of semiconductor nanostructures on the optical properties of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Catenary-like rippled biphenylene/graphene lateral heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a first-principles analysis to explore the structural and electronic properties of curved biphenylene/graphene lateral junctions (BPN/G). We start our investigation focusing on the energetic stability of BPN/G by varying the width of the graphene region, BPN/Gn. The electronic structure of BPN/Gn reveals (i) the formation of metallic channels mostly localized along the BPN stripes, where (ii) the features of the energy bands near the Fermi level are ruled by the width (n) of the graphene regions, Gn. In the sequence, we find that the hydrogenation of BPN/Gn results in a semiconductor system with a catenary-like rippled geometry. The electronic states of the hydrogenated system are mainly confined in the curved Gn regions, and the dependence of the bandgap on the width of Gn is similar to that of hydrogenated armchair graphene nanoribbons. The effects of curvature on the electronic structure, analyzed in terms of external mechanical strain, revealed that the increase/decrease of the band gap is also dictated by the width of the Gn region. Further electronic transport calculations reveal a combination of strong transmission anisotropy and the emergence of negative differential resistance. Based on these findings, we believe that rippled biphenylene/graphene systems can be useful for the design of two-dimensional nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Directional Locking and Hysteresis in Stripe and Bubble Forming Systems on One-Dimensional Periodic Substrates with a Rotating Drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of a two-dimensional stripe, bubble, and crystal forming system interacting with a periodic one-dimensional substrate under an applied drive that is rotated with respect to the substrate periodicity direction $x$. We find that the stripes remain strongly directionally locked to the $x$ direction for an extended range of drives before undergoing motion parallel to the drive. In some cases, the stripes break apart at the unlocking transition, but can dynamically reform into stripes aligned perpendicular to the $x$ direction, producing hysteresis in the directional locking and unlocking transitions. In contrast, moving anisotropic crystal and bubble phases exhibit weaker directional locking and reduced or no hysteresis. The hysteresis occurs in regimes where the particle rearrangements occur and is most pronounced near the stripe phase. We also show that for varied substrate strength, substrate spacing, and particle density, a number of novel dynamical patterns can form that include a combination of stripe, bubble, and crystal morphologies.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Moir\'e Engineering in Twisted Bilayers of High-Pseudospin Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e engineering offers new pathways for manipulating emergent states in twisted layered materials and lattice-mismatched heterostructures. With the key role of the geometry of the underlying lattice in mind, here we introduce the watermill lattice, a two-dimensional structure with low-energy states characterized by massless pseudospin-3/2 fermions with high winding numbers. Its twisted bilayer is shown to exhibit magic angles, where four isolated flat bands emerge around the Fermi level, featuring elevated Wilson-loop windings and enhanced quantum geometric effects, such as an increase in the ratio of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature to the mean-field critical temperature under a weak Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing. We discuss how the watermill lattice could be realized in the MXene and group-IV materials. Our study highlights the potential of exploiting lattice geometry in moir\'e engineering to uncover novel quantum phenomena and tailor emergent electronic properties in materials.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect with Andreev and Majorana bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-semiconductor hybrids are useful for realizing the Josephson diode effect, where nonreciprocity in the supercurrents occurs due to the interplay of the Josephson effect and applied magnetic fields. These junctions can host Andreev and Majorana states with the same ingredients, though their interplay with the Josephson diode effect is unclear. In this work, we consider short Josephson junctions based on superconductor-semiconductor systems under homogeneous Zeeman fields and investigate the Josephson diode effect in the presence of Andreev and Majorana states. Under generic conditions, the Zeeman field component parallel to the spin-orbit axis promotes an asymmetric low-energy energy spectrum as a function of the superconducting phase, which persists in the trivial and topological phases hosting Andreev and Majorana bound states, respectively. Interestingly, this asymmetry creates supercurrents that are not odd functions of the phase difference, leading to a nonreciprocal behaviour and the Josephson diode effect. We show that the Josephson diode effect is particularly promoted under the presence of both zero-energy Andreev and Majorana bound states, revealing that Josephson diodes can be realized in the trivial and topological phases of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. We then demonstrate that the Zeeman field evolution of the diode's efficiencies can map the topological phase transition and the formation of Majorana bound states via an oscillatory behavior that becomes more visible in long superconductors. While Josephson diodes generally exist in the trivial and topological phases of Josephson junctions, we discover that in the tunneling regime only a Josephson diode effect in the topological phase remains due to the finite contribution of Majorana bound states. Our findings clarify the Josephson diode effect and aid in realizing Majorana-only Josephson diodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The class of two-dimensional carbides and nitrides known as MXenes exhibit remarkable electronic properties. Tailoring these properties, however, requires an in-depth understanding of the band structure and Fermi-surface topology. Surface oxidation of MXenes has previously hampered the characterization of their Fermi surface, which is crucial for understanding the topology and anisotropy in the electronic structure and, ultimately, for tailoring electronic properties. Here, we reveal the Fermi surface topology and band structure of purely oxygen-terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene achieved through rigorous thin film sample preparation and ultrahigh vacuum annealing. Polarized synchrotron radiation-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals electron pockets, bulk band gaps, and a Dirac-like feature in the anisotropic electronic band structure. This paves the way for a fundamental understanding of band engineering of electronic transport properties, providing insights of importance for energy storage devices, transparent conductors, and catalysis.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Tripartite Coupling of Single Electrons on Solid Neon with Magnons in a Hybrid Quantum System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent nonlinear tripartite interactions are critical for advancing quantum simulation and information processing in hybrid quantum systems, yet they remain experimentally challenging and still evade comprehensive exploration. Here, we predict a nonlinear tripartite coupling mechanism in a hybrid setup comprising a single electron trapped on a solid neon surface and a nearby micromagnet. The tripartite coupling here leverages the electron's intrinsic charge (motional) and spin degrees of freedom interacting with the magnon modes of the micromagnet. Thanks to the large spatial extent of the electron zero-point motion, we show that it is possible to obtain a tunable and strong spin-magnon-motion coupling at the single quantum level, with two phonons simultaneously interacting with a single spin and magnon excitation. This enables, for example, dissipative interactions between the electron's charge and spin degrees of freedom, permitting controlled phonon addition/subtraction in the electron's motional state and the preparation of steady-state non-Gaussian motional states. This protocol can be readily implemented with the well-developed techniques in electron traps and may open new avenues for general applications in quantum simulations and information processing based on strongly coupled hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Layer-Dependent Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, first proposed in the Haldane model, is a paradigmatic example of the application of band topology in condensed matter physics. The recent experimental discoveries of high Chern number QAH effect in pentalayer and tetralayer rhombohedral graphene highlight the intriguing interplay between strong interactions and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we propose a minimal interacting model for spin-orbit-coupled rhombohedral graphene and use the Hartree-Fock analysis to explore the phase diagram at charge neutrality. We find that with Ising SOC on one outmost graphene layer, the in-plane layer-antiferromagnetic order is the insulating ground state without displacement field. Upon increasing the gate displacement field, we find that the QAH state with Chern number being equal to the layer number emerges between layer-antiferromagnetic state and layer-polarized state, which is consistent with experimental observations. Remarkably, we study the phase diagram for different thicknesses and find pentalayer is optimal for the QAH effect. Finally, we propose that the QAH state is enlarged by engineering opposite Ising SOC on the opposite outmost layers of rhombohedral graphene. These results will facilitate the realization of QAH states in rhombohedral graphene with different thicknesses. Our work serves as a foundation for further exploration of correlated physics of insulating state in rhombohedral graphene.</description>

Abstract: We report a linear-scaling numerical method for exploring nonequilibrium electron dynamics in systems of arbitrary complexity. Based on the Chebyshev expansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the method gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in models of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After validating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean graphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that the interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene might be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of graphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of large-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and disorder.</description>

Abstract: We investigate Floquet engineering of three-dimensional Dirac fermions driven by propagating waves, identifying distinct quantum states and phase transitions in the time-like, light-like, and space-like regimes. Notably, we uncover a novel regime where Floquet Weyl bands emerge and transition into Type-II Weyl states as the wave speed nears the Fermi velocity. Using Floquet-Bloch theory, we demonstrate that Lorentz contraction strongly amplifies Floquet band modulation effects, leading to a shockwave-like state synchronized with the wave motion. These findings extend beyond electrons to quasiparticles with relativistic dispersions, opening new avenues for dynamic band engineering in quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue to extend the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>

      <title>Pulsed magnetic field gradient on a tip for nanoscale imaging of spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (nanoMRI) aims at obtaining structure at the single molecule level. Most of the techniques for effecting a nanoMRI gradient use small permanent magnets. Here, we present a switchable magnetic field gradient on a tip, which is designed to provide a local and controllable magnetic field with a high gradient on the nanometer scale. We incorporate the gradient field with a nanoscale magnetic resonance sensor, a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, to provide high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. The device is a metal microwire deposited along a quartz tip, with the current flowing along the tip inducing a magnetic field around its apex. This field can be manipulated throughout a measurement by controlling the current along the wire. We achieved gradients as high as 1 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T/nm}$ at fields weaker than 200 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T}$. Such a gradient can facilitate electron spin mapping with 1 nm resolution using single NV sensors, allowing for nanoscale imaging of electrons. The ability to switch the current on and off and to position the device with high precision overcomes limitations such as limited emitter contrast and the flexibility in sample preparation. Moreover, we show that proximity of the metallic tip to the sensor modifies the Rabi power in a spatially dependent manner, providing regions with enhanced ($\times$3.5) and decreased Rabi power. This spatial gradient, induced by the tip, offers the opportunity for selective pulses on nearby spin species where the same microwave power will result in different spin manipulation characteristics.</description>

Abstract: We report the synthesis of single crystals of the $R_3\text{Ni}_{30}\text{B}_{10}$ $(R = \text{La}, \text{Ce})$ system which realizes the tetragonal $P4/nmm$ (No. 129) space group. We performed single crystal, transmission X-ray diffraction measurements to determine the crystal structure. Additionally, we characterized the samples through magnetization, resistivity, and heat capacity measurements. The $R = \text{Ce}$ system exhibits mixed-valence states and we observe maxima in the heat capacity at $T_1^* = 6 \, \text{K}$ and $T_2^* = 2 \, \text{K}$ (both absent for $R = \text{La}$) with no corresponding features in the resistivity or magnetization. We discuss the potential roles of multipolar and short-ranged/partial order in connection to the $T_1^*$ anomalous order.</description>

      <title>Effective K Valley Hamiltonian for Twisted TMDs which Exhibit Pressure Dependent Topological Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on topologically nontrivial moir\'{e} bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer systems subject to pressure, which is applied perpendicular to the material surface. We start our investigation by first considering untwisted bilayer systems with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry analysis for this case permits us to obtain a simplified effective low-energy Hamiltonian valid near the important $\mathbf{K}$ valley region of the Brillouin zone. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to obtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5 GPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data was then fitted to the low-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then could model a twisted system by treating the twist as a position-dependent shift between layers. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the explicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us to study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As a result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as indicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure could be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.</description>

      <title>Fermi Velocity Dependent Critical Current in Ballistic Bilayer Graphene Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L&gt;\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Green's Function Formalism Applicable to Discrete Impurities in Semiconductor Nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new theoretical framework for the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) scheme is presented to account for the discrete nature of impurities doped in semiconductor nanostructures. The short-range part of impurity potential is included as scattering potential in the self-energy due to spatially localized impurity scattering, and the long-range part of impurity potential is treated as the self-consistent Hartree potential by coupling with the Poisson equation. The position-dependent impurity scattering rate under inhomogeneous impurity profiles is systematically derived so that its physical meaning is clarified. The position dependence of the scattering rate turns out to be represented by the `center of mass' coordinates in the Wigner coordinates, rather than the real-space coordinates. Consequently, impurity scattering is intrinsically nonlocal in space. The proposed framework is applied to cylindrical thin wires under the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) approximation. We show explicitly how the discrete nature of impurities affects the transport properties such as electrostatic potential, local density of states, carrier density, scattering rates, and mobility.</description>

Abstract: Many architectures for quantum information processing rely on qubits dedicated for the readout of a larger quantum register. These ancilla readout qubits present a physical overhead not contributing to the computational resource. A common implementation in spin qubit architectures is the readout schemes based on Pauli exclusion of charges confined in a double quantum dot, with one dot serving as the ancilla qubit. Here, using a three-qubit spin register and a Pauli exclusion-based readout, we present z-basis measurements of the entire register constructed with tomography, eliminating the physical overhead. We validate our approach with simulations which provide insight into potential sources of errors in the reconstruction. We also demonstrate our reconstruction by performing quantum state tomography on a GHZ state of a spin-qubit based device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of a growing interdisciplinary interest in the angular momentum of wave fields, the spin-wave case has yet to be fully explored, with the extensively studied notion of spin transport being only part of the broader picture. Here we report experimental evidence for magnon orbital angular momentum, demonstrating that the mode exhibits rotation rather than remaining stationary. This conclusion is drawn from observations of the lifted degeneracy of waves with counter-rotating wave fronts. This requires an unambiguous formulation of spin and orbital angular momenta for spin waves, which we provide in full generality based on a systematic application of quantum field theory techniques. The results unequivocally establish magnetic dipole-dipole interactions as a magnetic-field controllable spin-orbit interaction for magnons. Our findings open a new research direction, leveraging the spectroscopic readability of angular momentum for azimuthal spin waves and other related systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of an ever-expanding experimental and theoretical interest in the magnetization dynamics of mesoscopic magnetic structures, both in the classical and quantum regimes, we formulate a low energy field theory for the linear spin-waves in finite and textured ferromagnets and we perform its constrained canonical quantization. The introduction of a manifestly gauge invariant Lagrangian enables a straightforward application of the Noether's theorem. Taking advantage of this in the context of a broad class of axisymmetric ferromagnets of special conceptual and experimental relevance, a general expression of the conserved and quantized spin-wave total angular momentum is rigorously derived, while separate conservation and quantization of its orbital and spin components are established for a more restricted class of uniaxial exchange ferromagnets. Further particularizing this general framework to the case of axially saturated magnetic thin disks, we develop a semi-analytic theory of the low frequency part of the exchange-dipole azimuthal spin wave spectrum, providing a powerful theoretical platform for the analysis and interpretation of magnetic resonance experiments on magnetic microdots as further demonstrated in a joint paper [arxiv The Orbital Angular Momentum of Azimuthal Spin-Waves]</description>

Abstract: Introducing topologically protected skyrmions in graphene holds significant importance for developing high-speed, low-energy spintronic devices. Here, we present a centrosymmetric ferromagnetic graphene/trilayer Cr2Ge2Te6/graphene heterostructure, demonstrating the anomalous and topological Hall effect due to the magnetic proximity effect. Through gate voltage control, we effectively tune the emergence and size of skyrmions. Micromagnetic simulations reveal the formation of skyrmions and antiskyrmions, which respond differently to external magnetic fields, leading to oscillations in the topological Hall signal. Our findings provide a novel pathway for the formation and manipulation of skyrmions in centrosymmetric two-dimensional magnetic systems, offering significant insights for developing topological spintronics.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general stability analysis for objective structures, which constitute a far reaching generalization of crystal lattice systems. We show that these particle systems, although in general neither periodic nor space filling, allow for the identification of stability constants in terms of representations of the underlying symmetry group and interaction potentials. Our main results provide general stability criteria and second order energy bounds for equilibrium configurations. In particular, a general computational algorithm to test objective structures for their stability is derived. By way of example we show that our method can be applied to verify the stability of carbon nanotubes with chirality.</description>

Abstract: Strange metals arise in a variety of platforms for strongly correlated electrons, ranging from the cuprates, heavy fermions to flat band systems. Motivated by recent experiments in kagome metals, we study a Hubbard model on a kagome lattice whose noninteracting limit contains flat bands. A Kondo lattice description is constructed, in which the correlation effects are captured by symmetry preserving and exponentially localized molecular orbitals. These compact molecular orbitals represent the local degrees of freedom that emerge from topological flat bands. We identify a quantum critical point at which quasiparticles are lost and strange metallicity emerges. Our theoretical work opens up a new route for realizing beyond-Landau quantum criticality, as well as the associated strange metallicity and emergent quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical phenomena in condensed matter normally arise from the collective effect of all atoms, while selectively addressing a lone atomic sublattice by external stimulus is elusive. The later functionality may, however, be useful for different applications due to a possible response being different from that occurring when the external stimulus affects the whole solid. Here, we introduce cross-chain antiferromagnets, where the stacking of two magnetic sublattices form a pattern of intersecting atomic chains, supportive to the sublattice selectivity. We dub this antiferromagnetic (AFM) stacking X-type and demonstrate that it reveals unique spin-dependent transport properties not present in conventional magnets. Based on high-throughput analyses and computations, we unveil three prototypes of X-type AFM stacking and identify 15 X-type AFM candidates. Using $\beta$-Fe$_{2}$PO$_{5}$ as a representative example, we predict the sublattice-selective spin-polarized transport driven by the X-type AFM stacking, where one magnetic sublattice is conducting, while the other is not. As a result, a spin torque can be exerted solely on a single sublattice, leading to unconventional ultrafast dynamics of the N\`eel vector capable of deterministic switching of the AFM domains. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked type of magnetic moment stacking and reveals sublattice-selective physical properties promising for high-performance spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated using the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These provide valuable insights into the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a study of a disorder-dependent real-space representation of the quantum geometry in topological systems. Thanks to the development of an efficient linear-scaling numerical methodology based on the kernel polynomial method, we can explore nontrivial behavior of the integrated quantum metric and Chern number in disordered systems with sizes reaching the experimental scale. We illustrate this approach in the disordered Haldane model, examining the impact of Anderson disorder and vacancies on the trivial and topological phases captured by this model.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing topological pumping of charges in exactly solvable Rice-Mele chains of the non-Hermitian variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the nature of the Thouless charge-pumping for a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of the one-dimensional (1d) Rice-Mele model, considering a variety which allows closed-form analytical solutions for the eigensystems. The two-band system is subjected to an ``adiabatic'' time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2d) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2d Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2d manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly-fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time-evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed readout of Superconductor--Normal-Conductor--Superconductor bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, ultrasensitive calorimeters have been proposed as a resource-efficient solution for multiplexed qubit readout in superconducting large-scale quantum processors. However, experiments demonstrating frequency multiplexing of these superconductor--normal--conductor--superconductor (SNS) sensors are are lacking in the literature. To this end, we present the design, fabrication, and operation of three SNS sensors with frequency-multiplexed input and probe circuits, all on a single chip. These devices have their probe frequencies in the range 150 MHz--200 MHz, which is well detuned from the heater frequencies of 4.4 GHz--7.6 GHz compatible with typical readout frequencies of superconducting qubits. Importantly, we show on-demand triggering of both individual and multiple low-noise SNS bolometers with very low cross talk. These experiments pave the way for multiplexed bolometric characterization and calorimetric readout of multiple qubits, a promising step in minimizing related resources such as the number of readout lines and microwave isolators in large-scale superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Kramers-protected hardware-efficient error correction with Andreev spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit-flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors and Andreev spin qubits results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit-flip code. The electrodynamics of the many-body spin states also respect these stabilizers, and we show how reflectometry off a single coupled resonator can thereby accomplish their projective measurement. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of single- and two-module logical quantum gates. The concept, which we dub the Ising molecule qubit (or Isene), is experimentally feasible and provides a path for compact noise-biased qubits.</description>

      <title>An ultra-compact deterministic source of maximally entangled photon pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an ultra-compact source of maximally entangled on-demand photon pairs. Our results are based on coupling of single GaAs quantum dots that are embedded in monolithic micro-lenses to a single-mode fiber with directly attached to 3D-printed micro-optics (NA of 0.6) inside a cryogenic environment. This approach, which is geared towards future integration into industrial environments, yields state-of-the-art entangled photon pair creation performance while retaining flexibility and adjustability required for long-term operation of such a device - all while dramatically reducing the overall system footprint. We demonstrate near diffraction-limited performance and hyperspectral imaging utilizing a 3D-printed micro-objective with a full width at half maximum resolution limit of 604(16) nm when operating the system at a cryogenic temperature of 3.8 K. Furthermore, we prove that this system can be used to achieve single photon emission rates of 392(20) kHz at a 76 MHz pump rate and purities of 99.2(5) % using two-photon resonant excitation. Utilizing the exciton-biexciton emission cascade available in GaAs quantum dots under resonant excitation, near maximally entangled photon pairs with peak entanglement negatives 2n of 0.96(2) in a 4 ps time window, and 0.81(1) when averaged over one exciton lifetime, are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A novel spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>
