      <title>A Global-scale Database of Seismic Phases from Cloud-based Picking at Petabyte Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first global-scale database of 4.3 billion P- and S-wave picks extracted from 1.3 PB continuous seismic data via a cloud-native workflow. Using cloud computing services on Amazon Web Services, we launched ~145,000 containerized jobs on continuous records from 47,354 stations spanning 2002-2025, completing in under three days. Phase arrivals were identified with a deep learning model, PhaseNet, through an open-source Python ecosystem for deep learning, SeisBench. To visualize and gain a global understanding of these picks, we present preliminary results about pick time series revealing Omori-law aftershock decay, seasonal variations linked to noise levels, and dense regional coverage that will enhance earthquake catalogs and machine-learning datasets. We provide all picks in a publicly queryable database, providing a powerful resource for researchers studying seismicity around the world. This report provides insights into the database and the underlying workflow, demonstrating the feasibility of petabyte-scale seismic data mining on the cloud and of providing intelligent data products to the community in an automated manner.</description>

      <title>Waves in ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ocean surface waves can propagate long distances through regions containing floating ice covers. The impacts ocean waves have on the ice covers are of interest in the climate change era, as the polar regions experience pressure from rising temperatures. This chapter provides a review of observations and theoretical models for ocean wave propagation through the marginal ice zone, landfast ice and ice shelves. It traces the historical evolution of the field, from seminal work in the 1970s-80s up to recent research advances. Key research questions are identified for each of the three ice covers, and commonalities between them are highlighted. The chapter concludes with perspectives and outlooks on the field of waves in ice, in the context of the dramatic changes currently occurring to the world's sea ice and ice shelves.</description>

      <title>The influence of data gaps and outliers on resilience indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19034v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resilience, or stability, of major Earth system components is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic pressures, demanding reliable early warning signals for abrupt and irreversible regime shifts. Widely used data-driven resilience indicators based on variance and autocorrelation detect `critical slowing down', a signature of decreasing stability. However, the interpretation of these indicators is hampered by poorly understood interdependencies and their susceptibility to common data issues such as missing values and outliers. Here, we establish a rigorous mathematical analysis of the statistical dependency between variance- and autocorrelation-based resilience indicators, revealing that their agreement is fundamentally driven by the time series' initial data point. Using synthetic and empirical data, we demonstrate that missing values substantially weaken indicator agreement, while outliers introduce systematic biases that lead to overestimation of resilience based on temporal autocorrelation. Our results provide a necessary and rigorous foundation for preprocessing strategies and accuracy assessments across the growing number of disciplines that use real-world data to infer changes in system resilience.</description>

      <title>FASTDASH: An Implementation of 3D Earthquake Cycle Simulation on Complex Fault Systems Using the Boundary Element Method Accelerated by H-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault systems have geometrically complex structures in nature, such as stepovers, bends, branches, and roughness. Many geological and geophysical studies have shown that the geometrical complexity of fault systems in nature decisively influences the initiation, arrest, and recurrence of seismic and aseismic events. However, a vast majority of models of slip dynamics are conducted on planar faults due to algorithmic limitations. We develop a 3D quasi-dynamic slip dynamics model to overcome this restriction. The calculation of the elastic response due to slip is a matrix-vector multiplication in boundary element method, which can be accelerated by using hierarchical matrices. The computational complexity is reduced from the order of O(N^2) to O(N log N), where N is the number of degree of freedoms used. We validate our code with a static crack analytical solution and the SEAS benchmark/validation exercise from Southern California Earthquake Center. We further employ this method on a realistic fault system with complex geometry that was reactivated during the 2023 Kahramanmaras - Turkiye doublet earthquakes, generating slip sequences that closely match real observations.</description>
