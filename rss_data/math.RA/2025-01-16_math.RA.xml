      <title>Commutator products in skew Laurent series division rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1965, Baxter established that a simple ring is either a field or that every one of its elements can be expressed as a sum of products of commutator pairs. In a recent paper, Gardella and Thiel demonstrated that every element in a noncommutative division ring can be represented as the sum of just two products of two commutators. They further posed the question of whether every element in a noncommutative division ring can be represented as the product of two commutators. In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question for skew Laurent series division rings over fields.</description>

      <title>F-Inverse Monoids as Weakly Schreier Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that an inverse monoid $M$ is E-unitary if and only if the following diagram is an extension: $E(M) \to M \to M/\sigma$, where $E(M)$ is the semilattice of idempotents and $M/\sigma$ is the minimal group quotient. F-inverse monoids are another fundamental class of inverse semigroup and all F-inverse monoids are E-unitary. Thus given that F-inverse monoids have an associated extension it is natural to ask if these extensions satisfy any special properties. Indeed we show that $M$ is F-inverse if and only if the aforementioned extension is weakly Schreier. This latter result allows us to make use of relaxed factor systems to provide a new characterization of F-inverse monoids. We end by restricting to the Clifford case and find a new characterization of these with much in common with Artin gluings of frames.</description>

      <title>Local structure of idempotent algebras I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09599v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine and advance the study of the local structure of idempotent finite algebras started in [A.Bulatov, The Graph of a Relational Structure and Constraint Satisfaction Problems, LICS, 2004]. We introduce a graph-like structure on an arbitrary finite idempotent algebra including those admitting type 1. We show that this graph is connected, its edges can be classified into 4 types corresponding to the local behavior (set, semilattice, majority, or affine) of certain term operations. We also show that if the variety generated by the algebra omits type 1, then the structure of the algebra can be `improved' without introducing type 1 by choosing an appropriate reduct of the original algebra. Taylor minimal idempotent algebras introduced recently is a special case of such reducts. Then we refine this structure demonstrating that the edges of the graph of an algebra omitting type 1 can be made `thin', that is, there are term operations that behave very similar to semilattice, majority, or affine operations on 2-element subsets of the algebra. Finally, we prove certain connectivity properties of the refined structures.
  This research is motivated by the study of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem, although the problem itself does not really show up in this paper.</description>

      <title>Modules determined by their Newton polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the $\tau$-tilting theory, there exist two classes of foundamental modules: indecomposable $\tau$-rigid modules and left finite bricks. In this paper, we prove the indecomposable $\tau$-rigid modules and the left finite bricks are uniquely determined by their Newton polytopes spanned by the dimensional vectors of their quotient modules. This is a kind of generalization of Gabriel's result that the indecomposable modules over path algebras of Dynkin quivers are uniquely determined by their dimensional vectors.</description>
