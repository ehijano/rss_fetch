      <title>High-Frequency Gravitational Waves on BREAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of light axion dark matter experiments as high-frequency gravitational wave (HFGW) detectors has garnered increasing attention in recent years. We explore the capabilities of the Broadband Reflector Experiment for Axion Detection (BREAD) in probing the GW parameter space and study the directional dependence of its coverage. This detector can investigate frequencies ranging from 0.05 to 200 THz. We find that employing single photon detectors BREAD is sensitive to GWs with characteristic strains as low as $10^{-21}$ at 0.1 THz and $10^{-25}$ at 200 THz with a year exposure time, making it competitive with other proposals operating at similar frequencies.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from Q-balls produced in a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the formation of Q-balls in false vacuum remnants during a cosmological first-order phase transition. We find that under certain circumstances Q-balls can collapse to form primordial black holes. This scenario can produce multimessenger signals that may be observed at upcoming experiments, including 1-100 nHz gravitational waves from the phase transition, and gamma-rays emitted from primordial black holes as Hawking radiation and as superradiance. These signals are quite distinctive, and differ markedly from signals expected from Fermi-balls. The reheating of the dark sector from the phase transition may address the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of primordial black hole accretion during early matter domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scenario in which primordial black holes (PBHs) form in a post-inflationary radiation-dominated (RD) phase and then experience significant accretion during a phase of early matter dominated (EMD). We show that PBH masses could grow by up to two orders of magnitude. Restricting to the linear perturbation regime, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum that features two peaks. The high-frequency peak is associated with the PBH formation in the RD phase, while the low-frequency peak is due to the sudden transition from EMD to the later, standard RD phase. We identify a PBH mass range where one or both peaks can be observed by a combination of different GW detectors. Finally, we show the signal-to-noise ratio of the total GW spectrum for PBHs in the asteroid mass window, where they could comprise the totality of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-like structures in the strong interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy flavor hadrons, especially doubly heavy baryons and doubly heavy tetraquarks, have always received extensive attention in theoretical and experimental research. Given the separation of quark masses $m_Q \gg m_q$ ($Q = c, b$ and $q = u, d, s$), this type of heavy flavor hadrons can be well regarded as hydrogen-like structures in the strong interaction. In the theoretical framework of Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we derive the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for the motion of light quarks in the effective potential field of heavy quarks. Taking proper account of the color-spin hyperfine interaction, we carry out a systematic study on the mass spectra of $S$-wave doubly heavy baryons and doubly heavy tetraquarks. The model parameters required for the calculation are obtained by fitting conventional hadrons. The investigation on the doubly heavy baryon systems indicates the reliability of our theoretical approach. Our calculation results show that the experimentally discovered $T_{cc}^+$ is most likely a compact tetraquark $|(cc)_0^{6}(\bar{u}\bar{d})_1^{\bar{6}}\rangle$ state with quantum numbers $(I,J^P)=(0, 1^+)$. Forthermore, for different quantum number assignments, some stable tetraquark states are found and may be very narrow peaks. The predictions for other heavy flavor hadrons are expected to be confirmed in new theories and future experiments.</description>

      <title>IceCube PeV neutrinos from heavy dark matter decay with 12 years HESE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of superheavy dark matter from the early universe may undergo decay via QCD cascades and electroweak cascade to produce neutrinos as one of the decay products. We consider the neutrino events in and around PeV region reported by IceCube collaboration are due to the decay of such heavy dark matter. The neutrino spectrum could be from the decay processes via hadronic decay modes and/or leptonic decay modes. Using the numerical evolution of QCD cascades as well as electroweak corrections where use has been made of DGLAP equations, the neutrino fluxes from the heavy dark matter decay have been computed. The mass of the decaying superheavy dark matter and its decay lifetime have then been estimated from a $\chi^2$ analysis of the IceCube 12-year data. The fractional contribution ($f_{\rm lep}$) of the leptonic decay channel in such a decay process is also estimated from the same $\chi^2$ analyses. It is seen that to explain the IceCube 12-year ultrahigh energy (UHE) events the mass of a decaying superheavy dark matter would be $\sim9.4\times 10^6$ GeV and decay time $\tau \simeq 4.2 \times 10^{28}$ second. It is also found that the lepton channel contribution is very small, $f_{\rm lep} \sim 0.001$.</description>

      <title>Probing nuclear structure in relativistic p-O and O-O collisions at the LHC through the measurement of anisotropic flow coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RHIC and LHC plan to inject $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei with a focus to investigate collectivity and the origin of quark-gluon plasma signatures in small collision systems. $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei is known to possess clusters of $\alpha$-particles ($^{4}\rm He$) inside the nucleus. In this paper, we study the anisotropic flow coefficients such as elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), which are sensitive to the nuclear geometry of colliding nuclei, for p-O and O-O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=9.61$ TeV and 7 TeV respectively. The study is performed employing a hybrid model encompassing IPGlasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD. The results of the clustered nuclear geometry are compared with those of the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile. Both initial and final state anisotropies are explored. This study is thus one of its first kind, where the study of anisotropic flow coefficients for p-O and O-O collisions is presented using a hybrid hydrodynamics model. We find a small effect of $\alpha$-clustering in p-O, while a significant one for O-O collisions. It is also observed that the magnitude of the effect correlates with the size of the $^{4}$He.</description>

      <title>Exploring Charm Bound States: Mass Spectra and Decay Dynamics of D Mesons and $Cq\bar{q}\bar{q}$ Tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of several charm states exhibiting tetraquark-like characteristics at BESIII and LHCb, this study investigates the spectroscopy and decay properties of D mesons and tetraquark states with quark content $Cq\bar{q}\bar{q}$ within the diquark - antidiquark framework. The analysis is performed using a potential model based on the Cornell potential, considering color antitriplet - triplet configurations. Mass spectra are computed for both mesons and tetraquarks, while their decay behaviors are examined using the factorization approach for D mesons and Fierz rearrangement for tetraquark decays. Theoretical results are compared with experimentally observed resonances to improve our understanding of charm quark bound systems.</description>

      <title>$ \rho\to \pi\pi $ Hadronic Decay in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model: Mass-Width Interplay and Beyond-RPA Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for analyzing unstable composite particles using Green's functions and dispersion relations. As an illustrative example, we explore the
  $\rho$ vector meson decay process $\rho\to\pi\pi$
  within the Nambu -- Jona - Lasinio (NJL) model. Our approach addresses a key limitation of the four-quark interaction description, which adequately describes two-quark bound states but fails to describe decay
  processes. The Bethe-Salpeter(BS) wave function of the $\rho$ meson exhibits time evolution that leads to the physical mass
  $M$ incorporating a correction $\Delta M $. This correction depends on the decay width $\Gamma(M)$. This work provides crucial insights into the dynamical relationship between resonance masses and their decay properties, addressing a long-standing challenge in hadron physics. The calculated mass and width are in good agreement with the experimental values, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach for studying unstable hadronic systems beyond conventional bound-state approximations.</description>

      <title>Opening up New Parameter Space for Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, yet the minimal production mechanism solely based on active ($\nu_a$)-sterile ($\nu_s$) oscillations is excluded by astrophysical observations. Non-standard self-interactions in either active ($\nu_a-\nu_a$) or sterile ($\nu_s-\nu_s$) sector are known to alter the sterile neutrino DM production in the early Universe, which could alleviate the tension with astrophysical constraints to some extent. Here we propose a novel solution where scalar-mediated non-standard interactions between active and sterile neutrinos ($\nu_a-\nu_s$) generate new production channels for $\nu_s$, independent of the active-sterile mixing and without the need for any fine-tuned resonance or primordial lepton asymmetry. This framework enables efficient sterile neutrino DM production even at vanishingly small mixing angles and opens up new viable regions of parameter space that can be tested with future $X$-ray and gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Renormalizing the Quark-Meson-Diquark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark (QMD) model by comparing a renormalization approach with a renormalization-group (RG) consistent mean-field formulation based on the functional renormalization group (FRG). The renormalized QMD allows analytical investigations of key quantities such as the zero-temperature diquark gap and the critical temperature for color superconductivity, ultimately reproducing the exact BCS relation in the high-density limit. We carry out the same analysis for different schemes of RG-consistent QMD models. We show that the RG-consistent approach yields a phase diagram and thermodynamic properties qualitatively similar to those of the renormalization model, provided both are embedded within a unified scheme that ensures consistent vacuum properties. In particular, both treatments recover the expected high-density features characterized by the BCS relation and the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Our results highlight the relevance of renormalization and RG-consistent methods for accurately capturing the thermodynamics of QMD and related effective models with diquark degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested transmutation of a compact star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mechanism -- Magnetically Arrested Transmutation (MAT) -- to account for the observed absence of ordinary pulsars near the Galactic centre, a longstanding puzzle known as the missing pulsar problem and the over-representation of magnetic white dwarfs in the same region. In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M_0$ at their core. Although such EBHs generally grow by accreting host matter, we show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the star's transmutation into a black hole. We derive the conditions for MAT to occur, identifying a critical parameter $\beta$, which encapsulates the interplay between the magnetic field strength, host matter density, and EBH mass. For $0 &lt; \beta \leq 4/27$, the growth of the EBH is arrested, limiting its final mass ($M_{\rm f}$) to $M_0 &lt; M_{\rm f} \leq 3/2 M_0$, whereas for $\beta &gt; 4/27$, full transmutation may ensue. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence of ordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900, and the elevated population of magnetic white dwarfs, in the Galactic centre, and hence could be tested and should have implications for understanding dark matter and compact objects.</description>

      <title>Prospect of Constraining the EoS of Neutron Stars Using Post-Merger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-merger gravitational-wave emission from a binary neutron star merger carries crucial information about the equation of state (EoS) of matter at high temperatures. Current gravitational wave detectors have limited sensitivities at post-merger frequencies in the range [1.5, 4] kHz. Therefore, valuable inferences can only be made after combining information from multiple (BNS) events. Criswell et al. [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043021 (2023)] carries out an injection study to infer the radius posterior for a $1.6 M_{\odot}$ NS by combining the information from injected BNS events via the hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) formulation. This formulation utilizes empirical relations that connect the peak frequency of the post-merger remnant with the chirp mass of the system, and the EoS proxy parameter $R_{1.6}$. In this work, we extend the HBI formulation to other EoS proxy parameters (i.e., the radius of (NS), $R_{1.X}$, with masses 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8 $M_{\odot}$) and combine the four $R_{1.X}$ posteriors through the piecewise polytropic EoS model to obtain measurable constraints on the EoS of the NS. We show that the NS radii can be constrained to within $\sim$1 km ( $\sim$0.55 km) assuming uniform (astrophysical) prior on $R_{1.X}$ for injections in the A+ noise. We also study systematic biases in the analysis coming from the limitations of empirical relations.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of holographic baryon in strongly coupled fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin polarization for baryon in a hydrodynamic medium has been extensively studied in the weakly coupled regime using quantum kinetic theory. As a first study of this problem in the strongly coupled regime, we investigate holographically the spectral function of a probe baryon in the fluid-gravity background. This is done by carefully performing gradient expansion of the Dirac equation in the fluid-gravity background. Different contributions in the expansion are understood in terms of density matrices of the probe baryon and the medium. The resulting spectral functions indicate that the holographic baryonic is polarized as responses to fluid acceleration, shear stress and vorticity. The structures of the responses are similar to those found in weakly coupled studies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings as Dynamical Dark Energy: Novel Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings, topological defects predicted by high-energy theories, may contribute to the late-time expansion of the Universe, effectively mimicking dynamical dark energy. We investigate four phenomenological extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model involving a residual string network: (i) a non-relativistic component with positive energy density (Model~1), (ii) a velocity-dependent extension (Model~2), (iii) a non-relativistic string network with energy density allowed to take both positive and negative values (Model~3), and (iv) a general scenario with free energy and velocity parameters (Model~4). These models are constrained using \textit{Planck} CMB data, SDSS or DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae observations. Models~1 and~2 yield strong upper bounds on the string density, for example, $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}} &lt; 0.00901$ at 95\% CL from the CMB+DESI+DESY5 combination for Model~2, and mildly shift the inferred value of $H_0$ upward, though they are not favored by Bayesian evidence. For the same combination, the bulk velocity is bound as $v_{\mathrm{s}} &lt; 0.569$. Models~3 and~4 exhibit a consistent preference for slightly negative values of $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}}$, with CMB-only data yielding $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}} = -0.038^{+0.029}_{-0.022}$ and $v_{\mathrm{s}}&lt; 0.574$ in Model~4, and a best-fit improvement of $\Delta \chi^2 = -6.07$. However, these improvements are not sufficient to overcome the Occam penalty, and the Bayesian evidence continues to favor $\Lambda$CDM. These findings demonstrate the power of current data to constrain exotic energy components and encourage further exploration of string-inspired extensions to $\Lambda$CDM, particularly those involving negative-tension networks.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with improved inverse distance ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.</description>

      <title>Science for Peace and the need for Civil Clauses at universities and civilian research institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the end of World War II, the commitment to confine scientific activities in universities and research institutions to peaceful and civilian purposes has entered, in the form of {\it Civil Clauses}, the charters of many research institutions and universities. In the wake of recent world events, the relevance and scope of such Civil Clauses has been questioned in reports issued by some governments and by the EU Commission, a development that opens the door to a possible blurring of the distinction between peaceful and military research.
  This paper documents the reflections stimulated by a panel discussion on this issue recently organized by the Science4Peace Forum. We review the adoptions of Civil Clauses in research organizations and institutions in various countries, present evidence of the challenges that are emerging to such Civil Clauses, and collect arguments in favour of maintaining the purely civilian and peaceful focus of public (non-military) research.</description>

      <title>Off-shell form factor: factorization is violated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Sudakov form factor on the Coulomb branch of N=4 sYM, which endows only external states with masses, and implies that the former is off-shell in the traditional sense. Our consideration is performed at three-loop order in the near mass-shell limit. We use a combination of tools to perform required calculations centered around the Method of Regions as the main go-to formalism for the asymptotic expansion of emerging parametric Feynman integrals. Explicit separation of quantum loops in terms of hard, collinear, and ultrasoft modes allows us to explore the factorization properties of this infrared-sensitive quantity. While the hard region is cleanly separated from the rest, the ultrasoft-collinear modes remain intertwined. We exhibit effects of factorization violation explicitly in the momentum space making use of the infrared power counting.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the large-scale primordial power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, which are strictly constrained, the small-scale $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ remain less restricted. Considering local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, and combining them with the SNR analysis of LISA, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Furthermore, we examine the effects of different shapes of the primordial power spectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordial power spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations, with the corresponding constraint on the primordial non-Gaussian parameter being $-10.0&lt;f_{\mathrm{NL}}&lt;1.2$.</description>

      <title>Impact of strong magnetic field, baryon chemical potential, and medium anisotropy on polarization and spin alignment of hadrons</title>

Abstract: The recent observation of global spin polarization of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons and the spin alignment of $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$ vector mesons create remarkable interest in investigating the particle polarization in the relativistic fluid produced in heavy-ion collisions at GeV/TeV energies. Among other sources of spin polarization phenomena, the Debye mass of a medium plays a crucial role in particle polarization. Any modification brought to the effective mass due to the temperature, strong magnetic field ($eB$), baryonic chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$), medium anisotropy ($\xi$), and vorticity, etc., certainly affects the particle spin polarization. In this work, we explore the global hyperon spin polarization and the spin alignment of vector mesons corresponding to the strong magnetic field, baryonic chemical potential, and medium anisotropy. We find that the degree of spin polarization is flavor-dependent for hyperons. Meanwhile, vector meson spin alignment depends on the hadronization mechanisms of initially polarized quarks and anti-quarks. Medium anisotropy significantly changes the degree of spin polarization compared to the magnetic field and baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <title>B Anomalies in Two Higgs Doublet Model with Flavor Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-standing flavor anomalies in $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $b \to c \ell \nu$ persist. In this work, we explore a specific flavor-gauged two-Higgs doublet model (FG2HDM) extended by a scalar singlet, with an imposed $U(1)$ flavor symmetry. Compared to the Standard Model (SM), four additional scalars and one neutral gauge boson $Z'$ are added to the particle spectrum. The special Yukawa coupling matrices, due to the $U(1)$ symmetry, lead to flavor-changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) interactions uniquely occurring in the down-type quark sector, while the new gauge boson $Z'$ induces flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions in the down-type quark sector as well. The two distinct types of anomalies can be accommodated simultaneously in such a model. Incorporating scalar and vector contributions to $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $B_s^0$-$\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing, along with charged Higgs contributions to $b \to c \ell \nu$, we investigate the parameter space in FG2HDM and find substantial room in the solution space. Specifically, in the SM-like model setup, the data suggests that $m_{Z'} &lt; 450\, \text{GeV}$, $\tan\beta &lt; 28$, and $g'/m_{Z'} &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{GeV}^{-1}$, while there are fewer constraints on heavy scalars, which can be further tested by a combination of other observables.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the jet angular broadening with photon-tagged jets in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The medium modification of jet substructure in hot and dense nuclear matter has garnered significant interest from the heavy-ion physics community in recent years. Measurements of inclusive jets show an angular narrowing in nucleus-nucleus collisions, while recent CMS results for photon-tagged jets ($\gamma$+jets) suggest evidence of broadening. In this study, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the angular structure of inclusive jets and $\gamma$+jets using a transport approach that accounts for jet energy loss and the medium response in the quark-gluon plasma. We examine the girth modification of $\gamma$+jets in $0-30\%$ PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, achieving satisfactory agreement with recent CMS measurements. We explore the relationship between selection bias and jet kinematics by varying the threshold for $x_{j\gamma} = p_T^{\rm jet}/p_T^{\gamma}$. Notably, we quantitatively demonstrate that $\gamma$+jets significantly reduce selection bias and can effectively select jets that have been sufficiently quenched in PbPb collisions, which is crucial for capture the jet angular broadening. Additionally, we estimate the contributions of medium-induced gluon radiation and the medium response to the broadening of the jet angular substructure. Lastly, we analyze the modification patterns of jet $R_g$ and $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$ in PbPb collisions, which indicate slight broadening for $\gamma$+jets and noticeable narrowing for inclusive jets compared to pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing CP-violating Higgs-gauge Boson Couplings at Future Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of future muon colliders to CP-violating interactions in the Higgs sector, specifically focusing on the process $\mu^- \mu^+ \to h \bar{\nu_{l}} \nu_{l} \to b\bar{b} \bar{\nu_{l}}\nu_{l}$. Using a model-independent approach within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the contribution of dimension-six operators to Higgs-gauge boson couplings, emphasizing CP-violating effects. To simulate the process, all signal and background events are generated through MadGraph. The analysis provides 95\% confidence level limits on the relevant Wilson coefficients $\tilde{c}_{HB}$, $\tilde{c}_{HW}$, $\tilde{c}_{\gamma}$, with a comparative discussion of existing experimental and phenomenological constraints. Our best constraints on the $\tilde{c}_{HB}$, $\tilde{c}_{HW}$, $\tilde{c}_{\gamma}$ with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$ are $[-0.017428;0.018991]$, $[-0.002880;0.002586]$ and $[-0.010784;0.011381]$, respectively. In this context, this study highlights the capability of future muon collider experiments to probe new physics in the Higgs sector, potentially offering tighter constraints on CP-violating Higgs-gauge boson interactions than those provided by current colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore toponium, the smallest known quantum bound state of a top quark and its antiparticle, bound by the strong force. With a Bohr radius of $8\times 10^{-18}$~m and a lifetime of $2.5 \times 10^{-25}$~s, toponium uniquely probes microphysics. Unlike all other hadrons, it is governed by ultraviolet freedom. This distinction offers novel insights into quantum chromodynamics. Our analysis reveals a toponium signal exceeding $5\sigma$ in the distribution of the cross section ratio between $e^+e^- \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ and $e^+e^- \rightarrow q\bar{q}$ ($q=b,c,s,d,u$), based on 400~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected at $\sqrt{s}\approx 341~{\rm GeV}$. This discovery enables a top quark mass measurement with an uncertainty reduced by a factor of ten compared to current precision levels. Moreover, this method improves the systematic uncertainty by at least a factor of 2.7 compared to any other possible methods.</description>

      <title>A systematic investigation on vector dark matter-nucleus scattering in effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the general spin-one dark matter-nucleus interactions within the framework of effective field theories (EFT). We consider both the nonrelativistic (NR) and the relativistic EFT descriptions of the DM interactions with nucleons and quarks. In the NREFT framework, we present a complete list of NR operators for spin-one DM coupling to nucleons and compute their contributions to the DM response functions. Next, we consider all possible leading-order relativistic EFT operators between DM and light quarks and the photon, and perform NR reductions to match them onto the NREFT. We then derive the nuclear scattering rate from these interactions, and employ recent DM direct detection data (from both the nuclear recoil and the Migdal effect) to constrain all these EFT operators and DM electromagnetic properties. We find the elastic nuclear recoil data (from PandaX-4T, XENONnT, LZ, and DarkSide-50) set stringent bounds on the EFT coefficients for a DM mass above a few GeV while the Migdal effect datasets (from PandaX-4T, XENONnT, and DarkSide-50) can probe the DM mass region as small as 20 MeV. Lastly, we construct a UV complete model that can provide a complex spin-one DM candidate, and at the same time generate DM-quark/photon operators discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Total Drell-Yan in the flavorful SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of Drell-Yan production of charged leptons and dineutrinos, the latter in missing energy plus jet events, in proton-proton collisions within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The combination allows for the removal of flat directions, sharper limits and to probe more couplings than the individual observables, which we show performing a fit to LHC-data. We also find that limits have only mild dependence on lepton flavor patterns; hierarchies in quark flavors are driven by the parton distribution functions. The strongest constraints are on couplings involving the first and second generation quarks, exceeding 10 TeV. Combining flavor and high-$p_T$ data, the limits on electroweak and gluon dipole operators can be improved, by up to a factor of three, highlighting once more that a more global approach increases sensitivities significantly. We also estimate the improvements in reach over existing data for the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) by $\sim 1.5$, and future collider options such as the high-energy LHC (HE-LHC) by $\sim 3$ and FCC-hh by $\sim 8$. To maximize the new physics reach kinematic cuts and binning needs to be adjusted to each quark-flavor separately.</description>

Abstract: Isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is introduced to V-QCD, a bottom-up holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) model. Using a small isospin chemical potential we extract the symmetry energy in the model, finding excellent agreement with experimental results for some of the potentials. Extending the calculation for finite and arbitrary sized isospin chemical potentials, we construct beta-equilibrated neutron stars via the usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations. We find, pleasingly, that the neutron stars passing the mass/radius and tidal deformability constraints are those with the potentials that also lead to excellent symmetry energies.</description>

      <title>Low scale leptogenesis and $TM_1$ mixing in neutrinophillic two Higgs doublet model($\nu$2HDM) with S4 flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a modified version of the Standard Model that includes a scalar doublet and two right-handed neutrinos, forming the neutrinophillic two higgs doublet ($\nu\text{2HDM}$) framework. For $v_2 &lt;&lt; v_1$, this model operates at a TeV scale, bringing the RHNs within experimental reach. To further enhance its predictive power, we introduce an $S_4 \times Z_4$ flavor symmetry with five flavons, resulting in mass matrices that realize $\text{TM}_1$ mixing. The model effectively explains lepton masses and flavor mixing under the normal ordering of neutrino masses, predicting that the effective neutrino mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay lies between [4 - 5] meV, significantly lower than the sensitivity limits of current experiments. We also investigate how this framework could support low-scale leptogenesis as a natural way to explain the observed imbalance between matter and antimatter in the Universe. This work explores how neutrino physics, flavor symmetry, and baryon asymmetry are connected, providing a clear framework that links theoretical predictions with experimental possibilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the neutrino oscillation probability in vacuum using scattering theory methods developed earlier in the context of collider physics. It is computed from Feynman diagrams that combine neutrino production and detection processes into a single quantum amplitude. Initial-state particles in the neutrino source and the detector are treated as wave packets. In contrast to many other approaches, we work with transition probabilities, rather than the amplitude itself, and do not specify the form of the wave packets to arrive at the neutrino oscillation formula. Our approach offers a simple and transparent framework to discuss decoherence effects in neutrino oscillations, as well as the effects of the finite lifetime of the neutrino source. The latter are particularly relevant for oscillation experiments using neutrinos from pion decays in flight.</description>

      <title>The $\Lambda_c^+\to\Lambda\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$ reaction, and a triangle singularity producing the $\Sigma^*(1430)$ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the decay $\Lambda_c^+ \to \Lambda \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$, focusing on the production of the $\Sigma^*(1430)$ resonance observed by the Belle Collaboration. Interpreted as a dynamically generated state from meson-baryon interactions in the chiral unitary approach, the $\Sigma^*(1430)$ signal is shown to be enhanced by a triangle singularity involving intermediate $K^{*-}$, $p$, and $\bar K^0$ states. This mechanism leads to a sharp peak near 1434 MeV in the $\pi^+ \Lambda$ invariant mass distribution, in agreement with the experimental observations, and predicts a secondary peak around 1875 MeV in the $\pi^- \Sigma^*(1430)$ spectrum tied to the triangle singularity. We also estimate the branching ratio of $\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^- \Sigma^*(1430)$ to be about $3.5 \times 10^{-4}$. The results for the branching ratio and the $\pi^- \Sigma^*(1430)$ mass distributions are predictions of the theoretical approach, which could be tested with reanalysis of existing data.</description>

      <title>Dark Branches of Immortal Stars at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way can be significantly affected by dark matter annihilation, producing population-level effects that are visible in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. We establish the dark HR diagram, where stars lie on a new stable $\textit{dark main sequence}$ with similar luminosities, but lower temperatures, than the standard main sequence. The dark matter density in these stars continuously replenishes, granting these stars immortality and solving multiple stellar anomalies. Upcoming telescopes could detect the dark main sequence, offering a new dark matter discovery avenue.</description>

      <title>Exploring Faraday rotation signatures and population bounds for primordial magnetic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes bearing magnetic charges may bypass the constraints imposed by Hawking radiation, thereby enabling reasonable present-day populations, even for masses below $10^{15}\, \mathrm{g} $--a range previously considered improbable. They could, therefore, conceivably contribute to a component of dark matter. We investigate novel Faraday rotation signatures exhibited by primordial magnetic black holes while also establishing new Parker-type bounds on their populations. For the latter, we bound the dark matter fraction from intergalactic magnetic fields in cosmic voids $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-8}\right)$ and cosmic web filaments $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-4}\right)$, notably eclipsing previous bounds. Exploring Faraday rotation effects, we discern a pronounced rotation of the polarization angle and the rotation measure values for extremal primordial magnetic black holes with masses $M^{\text{ex.}}_{\text{ BH}} \gtrsim 10^{-6}~ \text{M}_\odot$. This makes them potentially detectable in current observations. A comparative investigation finds that the effects are notably greater than for a neutron star, like a Magnetar, with a similar magnetic field at the surface. Moreover, the polarization angle maps for primordial magnetic black holes exhibit unique features, notably absent in other astrophysical magnetic configurations. In this context, we also introduce a simple integral measure, offering a quantitative measure for their discrimination in many scenarios. These traits potentially suggest a robust avenue for their observational detection and differentiation.</description>

      <title>Origin of cosmological neutrino mass bounds: background $\textit{versus}$ perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological upper bound on the total neutrino mass is the dominant limit on this fundamental parameter. Recent observations-soon to be improved-have strongly tightened it, approaching the lower limit set by oscillation data. Understanding its physical origin, robustness, and model-independence becomes pressing. Here, we explicitly separate for the first time the two distinct cosmological neutrino-mass effects: the impact on background evolution, related to the energy in neutrino masses; and the "kinematic" impact on perturbations, related to neutrino free-streaming. We scrutinize how they affect CMB anisotropies, introducing two effective masses enclosing $\textit{background}$ ($\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Backg.}$) and $\textit{perturbations}$ ($\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.}$) effects. We analyze CMB data, finding that the neutrino-mass bound is mostly a background measurement, i.e., how the neutrino energy density evolves with time. The bound on the "kinematic" variable $\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.}$ is largely relaxed, $\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.} &lt; 0.8\,\mathrm{eV}$. This work thus adds clarity to the physical origin of the cosmological neutrino-mass bound, which is mostly a measurement of the neutrino equation of state, providing also hints to evade such a bound.</description>

      <title>Seeking the nearest neutron stars using a new local electron density map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a compelling testing ground for gravity, nuclear dynamics, and physics beyond the Standard Model, and so it will be useful to locate the neutron stars nearest to Earth. To that end, we revisit pulsar distance estimates extracted from the dispersion measure of pulsar radio waves scattering on electrons. In particular, we create a new electron density map for the local kiloparsec by fitting to parallax measurements of the nearest pulsars, which complements existing maps that are fit on the Galactic scale. This ``near-Earth'' electron density map implies that pulsars previously estimated to be 100-200 pc away may be as close as tens of parsecs away, which motivates a parallax-based measurement campaign to follow-up on these very-near candidate pulsars. Such nearby neutron stars would be valuable laboratories for testing fundamental physics phenomena, including several late-stage neutron star heating mechanisms, using current and forthcoming telescopes. We illustrate this by estimating the sensitivities of the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope to neutron stars heated by dark matter capture.</description>

      <title>The holographic space-time model of inflation and its predictions for the CMB primordial spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1998 Carlip and Solodukhin independently conjectured the equality between fluctuations in the modular Hamiltonian of black holes and its expectation value. Banks and Zurek's 2021 work generalized this observation to any causal diamonds. We use this observation to calculate the precise normalization of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra in the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation. In previous work Banks and Fischler outlined the general calculation of inflationary power spectra in this model, which we review here. Its conceptual basis is radically different from field theoretic inflation and it has no Transplanckian problems, but its predictions for power spectra will be shown to fit extant data equally well, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio agrees with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Status and prospects of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ at BESIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ serves as a pivotal role for understanding hadronic structures, remaining one of the most extensively studied exotic particles despite the experimental discovery of numerous unconventional hadronic states. Sustained experimental and theoretical investigations into the particle over the past two decades have propelled its study into a high-precision regime, marked by refined measurements of its decay dynamics and line shape, thereby offering critical insights to resolve longstanding debates between molecular, tetraquark, hybrid, and charmonium interpretations of this particle. The BESIII experiment has made seminal contributions to the study of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, leveraging its unique capabilities in high-statistics data acquisition and low-background condition. This article gives a concise review and prospects of the study of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ from the BESIII experiment.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>
