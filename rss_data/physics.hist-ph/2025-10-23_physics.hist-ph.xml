      <title>From Drag to Invariance: The Experimental Pressure Behind Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper completes a three-part study of Einstein's 1905 special relativity by reconstructing the experimental pressures that shaped his thinking from 1895 to June 1905. Following Stachel's historiographical line, I trace Einstein's path under the cumulative weight of a series of recalcitrant experiments: stellar aberration, Arago's prism test, Fresnel's partial-drag account, Boscovich's proposal of a water-filled telescope, Fizeau's water-tube result, ether-drift null experiments, and the magnet-conductor induction asymmetry. Lorentz's electron theory attempted to domesticate these findings within a fragile ether framework, while Einstein, still loyal to Maxwell's equations, became increasingly troubled by their conflict with Galilean kinematics. The paper examines Einstein's temporary adherence to emission theory and its decisive breakdown in light of Fizeau's result. In this reconstruction, the 1905 paper does not emerge as a kinematic postulate ex nihilo, but as a principled resolution forced by an interconnected complex of experimental anomalies.</description>

      <title>Fresnel's Mechanical Legacy Recovered: How Bubble Acoustics Unifies Partial Drag, Velocity Addition, and Atomic Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound waves in bubbly water and light in special relativity obey identical first-order transport laws. This equivalence is not approximate or analogical but mathematically identical to first order in $U/v$, sharing the same form discovered by Fresnel in 1818 for light in moving transparent media. We demonstrate that all three systems-bubble acoustics, optical drag, and relativistic velocity addition-are described by a universal partial entrainment equation where wave coupling to compliant components determines the drag coefficient. In bubbly liquids this physics is directly observable: waves couple to compressible bubbles rather than rigid liquid. Since bubble dynamics reproduces the relativistic result, velocity addition itself admits mechanical interpretation. Von Laue's 1907 derivation abstracted mechanics into kinematics; we reverse this, showing relativistic effects preserve mechanical content in abstract form. Beyond first-order equivalence, we show Fresnel's dispersive term encodes group velocity (energy transport) versus phase velocity (wave-crest motion)-a distinction mechanical models naturally capture but pure kinematic velocity addition cannot address. The rigidity-based interpretation of dispersion, established in acoustic metamaterials, provides cross-domain insights for materials design and suggests testable predictions linking acoustic compliance to optical drag. This three-way equivalence reduces independent phenomena to a single principle: waves riding compliant inclusions. Fresnel drag, Lorentz contraction, and atomic polarization all emerge as aspects of this one mechanism, traced through the historical density-versus-rigidity fork that shaped aether theory's trajectory. The compliant-inclusion principle shows striking quantitative agreement with isotope mass-dependence and resonance structure in existing spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Lorentz, Poincare, Einstein, and the Genesis of the Theory of Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work offers a historical reading of the genesis of special relativity by placing the contributions of Lorentz, Poincare, and Einstein within their scientific and editorial context. It highlights the importance of the German periodical Beiblatter zu den Annalen der Physik as a key channel for the dissemination of international scientific research. The perspective advanced here is that the true revolution did not lie in special relativity itself, but in Maxwell's electrodynamics. Special relativity thus appears as the necessary expression of a framework already transformed by the universality of the speed of light.</description>
