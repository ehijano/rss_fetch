      <title>STACodec: Semantic Token Assignment for Balancing Acoustic Fidelity and Semantic Information in Audio Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs are widely used for audio compression and can be integrated into token-based language models. Traditional codecs preserve acoustic details well but lack semantic information. Recent hybrid codecs attempt to incorporate semantic information through distillation, but this often degrades reconstruction performance, making it difficult to achieve both. To address this limitation, we introduce STACodec, a unified codec that integrates semantic information from self-supervised learning (SSL) models into the first layer of residual vector quantization (RVQ-1) via semantic token assignment (STA). To further eliminate reliance on SSL-based semantic tokenizers and improve efficiency during inference, we propose a semantic pre-distillation (SPD) module, which predicts semantic tokens directly for assignment to the first RVQ layer during inference. Experimental results show that STACodec outperforms existing hybrid codecs in both audio reconstruction and downstream semantic tasks, demonstrating a better balance between acoustic fidelity and semantic capability.</description>

      <title>From Hallucination to Articulation: Language Model-Driven Losses for Ultra Low-Bitrate Neural Speech Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Phoneme Hallucinations (PH)'' commonly occur in low-bitrate DNN-based codecs. It is the generative decoder's attempt to synthesize plausible outputs from excessively compressed tokens missing some semantic information. In this work, we propose language model-driven losses (LM loss) and show they may alleviate PHs better than a semantic distillation (SD) objective in very-low-bitrate settings. The proposed LM losses build upon language models pretrained to associate speech with text. When ground-truth transcripts are unavailable, we propose to modify a popular automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, Whisper, to compare the decoded utterance against the ASR-inferred transcriptions of the input speech. Else, we propose to use the timed-text regularizer (TTR) to compare WavLM representations of the decoded utterance against BERT representations of the ground-truth transcriptions. We test and compare LM losses against an SD objective, using a reference codec whose three-stage training regimen was designed after several popular codecs. Subjective and objective evaluations conclude that LM losses may provide stronger guidance to extract semantic information from self-supervised speech representations, boosting human-perceived semantic adherence while preserving overall output quality. Demo samples, code, and checkpoints are available online.</description>

      <title>B-GRPO: Unsupervised Speech Emotion Recognition based on Batched-Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised speech emotion recognition (SER) focuses on addressing the problem of data sparsity and annotation bias of emotional speech. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising method which enhances the performance through rule-based or model-based verification functions rather than human annotations. We treat the sample selection during the learning process as a long-term procedure and whether to select a sample as the action to make policy, thus achieving the application of RL to measure sample quality in SER. We propose a modified Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt it to classification problems, which takes the samples in a batch as a group and uses the average reward of these samples as the baseline to calculate the advantage. And rather than using a verifiable reward function as in GRPO, we put forward self-reward functions and teacher-reward functions to encourage the model to produce high-confidence outputs. Experiments indicate that the proposed method improves the performance of baseline without RL by 19.8%.</description>

      <title>Automatic Detection and Analysis of Singing Mistakes for Music Pedagogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of machine learning in audio analysis has opened new possibilities for technology-enhanced music education. This paper introduces a framework for automatic singing mistake detection in the context of music pedagogy, supported by a newly curated dataset. The dataset comprises synchronized teacher learner vocal recordings, with annotations marking different types of mistakes made by learners. Using this dataset, we develop different deep learning models for mistake detection and benchmark them. To compare the efficacy of mistake detection systems, a new evaluation methodology is proposed. Experiments indicate that the proposed learning-based methods are superior to rule-based methods. A systematic study of errors and a cross-teacher study reveal insights into music pedagogy that can be utilised for various music applications. This work sets out new directions of research in music pedagogy. The codes and dataset are publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Combination of Several Decorrelation Methods to Improve Acoustic Feedback Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends an acoustic feedback cancellation system by incorporating multiple decorrelation methods. The baseline system is based on a frequency-domain Kalman filter implemented in a multi-delay structure. The proposed extensions include a variable time delay line, prediction, distortion compensation, and a simplified reverberation model. Each extension is analyzed, and a practical parameter range is defined.
  While existing literature often focuses on a single extension, such as prediction, to describe an optimal system, this work demonstrates that each individual extension contributes to performance improvements. Furthermore, the combination of all proposed extensions results in a superior system. The evaluation is conducted using publicly available datasets, with performance assessed through system distance metrics and the objective speech quality measure PSEQ.</description>

      <title>Misophonia Trigger Sound Detection on Synthetic Soundscapes Using a Hybrid Model with a Frozen Pre-Trained CNN and a Time-Series Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misophonia is a disorder characterized by a decreased tolerance to specific everyday sounds (trigger sounds) that can evoke intense negative emotional responses such as anger, panic, or anxiety. These reactions can substantially impair daily functioning and quality of life. Assistive technologies that selectively detect trigger sounds could help reduce distress and improve well-being. In this study, we investigate sound event detection (SED) to localize intervals of trigger sounds in continuous environmental audio as a foundational step toward such assistive support. Motivated by the scarcity of real-world misophonia data, we generate synthetic soundscapes tailored to misophonia trigger sound detection using audio synthesis techniques. Then, we perform trigger sound detection tasks using hybrid CNN-based models. The models combine feature extraction using a frozen pre-trained CNN backbone with a trainable time-series module such as gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memories (LSTMs), echo state networks (ESNs), and their bidirectional variants. The detection performance is evaluated using common SED metrics, including Polyphonic Sound Detection Score 1 (PSDS1). On the multi-class trigger SED task, bidirectional temporal modeling consistently improves detection performance, with Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) achieving the best overall accuracy. Notably, the Bidirectional ESN (BiESN) attains competitive performance while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters by optimizing only the readout. We further simulate user personalization via a few-shot "eating sound" detection task with at most five support clips, in which BiGRU and BiESN are compared. In this strict adaptation setting, BiESN shows robust and stable performance, suggesting that lightweight temporal modules are promising for personalized misophonia trigger SED.</description>

      <title>Scaling Speech Tokenizers with Diffusion Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech tokenizers are foundational to speech language models, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) balancing trade-offs between encoding semantics for understanding and acoustics for reconstruction, and (2) achieving low bit rates and low token rates. We propose Speech Diffusion Tokenizer (SiTok), a diffusion autoencoder that jointly learns semantic-rich representations through supervised learning and enables high-fidelity audio reconstruction with diffusion. We scale SiTok to 1.6B parameters and train it on 2 million hours of speech. Experiments show that SiTok outperforms strong baselines on understanding, reconstruction and generation tasks, at an extremely low token rate of $12.5$ Hz and a bit-rate of 200 bits-per-second.</description>

      <title>Reading Between the Waves: Robust Topic Segmentation Using Inter-Sentence Audio Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken content, such as online videos and podcasts, often spans multiple topics, which makes automatic topic segmentation essential for user navigation and downstream applications. However, current methods do not fully leverage acoustic features, leaving room for improvement. We propose a multi-modal approach that fine-tunes both a text encoder and a Siamese audio encoder, capturing acoustic cues around sentence boundaries. Experiments on a large-scale dataset of YouTube videos show substantial gains over text-only and multi-modal baselines. Our model also proves more resilient to ASR noise and outperforms a larger text-only baseline on three additional datasets in Portuguese, German, and English, underscoring the value of learned acoustic features for robust topic segmentation.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Music Detection in Broadcast Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI music generators have advanced to the point where their outputs are often indistinguishable from human compositions. While detection methods have emerged, they are typically designed and validated in music streaming contexts with clean, full-length tracks. Broadcast audio, however, poses a different challenge: music appears as short excerpts, often masked by dominant speech, conditions under which existing detectors fail. In this work, we introduce AI-OpenBMAT, the first dataset tailored to broadcast-style AI-music detection. It contains 3,294 one-minute audio excerpts (54.9 hours) that follow the duration patterns and loudness relations of real television audio, combining human-made production music with stylistically matched continuations generated with Suno v3.5. We benchmark a CNN baseline and state-of-the-art SpectTTTra models to assess SNR and duration robustness, and evaluate on a full broadcast scenario. Across all settings, models that excel in streaming scenarios suffer substantial degradation, with F1-scores dropping below 60% when music is in the background or has a short duration. These results highlight speech masking and short music length as critical open challenges for AI music detection, and position AI-OpenBMAT as a benchmark for developing detectors capable of meeting industrial broadcast requirements.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Latent Fields for Precomputed Sound Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic sound propagation is essential for immersion in a virtual scene, yet physically accurate wave-based simulations remain computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Wave coding methods address this limitation by precomputing and compressing impulse responses of a given scene into a set of scalar acoustic parameters, which can reach unmanageable sizes in large environments with many source-receiver pairs. We introduce Reciprocal Latent Fields (RLF), a memory-efficient framework for encoding and predicting these acoustic parameters. The RLF framework employs a volumetric grid of trainable latent embeddings decoded with a symmetric function, ensuring acoustic reciprocity. We study a variety of decoders and show that leveraging Riemannian metric learning leads to a better reproduction of acoustic phenomena in complex scenes. Experimental validation demonstrates that RLF maintains replication quality while reducing the memory footprint by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a MUSHRA-like subjective listening test indicates that sound rendered via RLF is perceptually indistinguishable from ground-truth simulations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Automatic Speech Recognition for Indian Languages in Agricultural Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The digitization of agricultural advisory services in India requires robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems capable of accurately transcribing domain-specific terminology in multiple Indian languages. This paper presents a benchmarking framework for evaluating ASR performance in agricultural contexts across Hindi, Telugu, and Odia languages. We introduce evaluation metrics including Agriculture Weighted Word Error Rate (AWWER) and domain-specific utility scoring to complement traditional metrics. Our evaluation of 10,934 audio recordings, each transcribed by up to 10 ASR models, reveals performance variations across languages and models, with Hindi achieving the best overall performance (WER: 16.2%) while Odia presents the greatest challenges (best WER: 35.1%, achieved only with speaker diarization). We characterize audio quality challenges inherent to real-world agricultural field recordings and demonstrate that speaker diarization with best-speaker selection can substantially reduce WER for multi-speaker recordings (upto 66% depending on the proportion of multi-speaker audio). We identify recurring error patterns in agricultural terminology and provide practical recommendations for improving ASR systems in low-resource agricultural domains. The study establishes baseline benchmarks for future agricultural ASR development.</description>
