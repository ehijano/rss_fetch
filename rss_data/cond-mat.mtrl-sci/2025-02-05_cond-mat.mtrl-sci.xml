      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Analytical Models for Threshold Displacement Energy Prediction in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of materials under irradiation is crucial for the design and safety of nuclear reactors, spacecraft, and other radiation environments. The threshold displacement energy (Ed) is a critical parameter for understanding radiation damage in materials, yet its determination often relies on costly experiments or simulations. This work leverages the machine learning-based Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) method to derive accurate, analytical models for predicting Ed using fundamental material properties. The models outperform traditional approaches for monoatomic materials, capturing key trends with high accuracy. While predictions for polyatomic materials highlight challenges due to dataset complexity, they reveal opportunities for improvement with expanded data. This study identifies cohesive energy and melting temperature as key factors influencing Ed, offering a robust framework for efficient, data-driven predictions of radiation damage in diverse materials.</description>

      <title>Suppression of ferromagnetism in rippled La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane with process-induced strain prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal oxides are a platform for exploring strain-engineered intriguing physical properties and developing spintronic or flexible electronic functionalities owing to strong coupling of spin, charge and lattice degrees of freedom. In this study, we exemplify the strain-engineered magnetism of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ in freestanding and rippled membrane forms without and with process-induced strain, respectively, prepared by epitaxial lift-off technique. We find that the deposition of Pt/Ti stressor suppresses the crack formation in the lift-off process and induces a ripple structure in the La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane. Laser micrograph and Raman spectroscopy show a ripple period of about 30 um and a height of a few um, where alternating convex and concave structures are subjected to tensile strain of 0.6% and compressive strain of 0.5%, respectively. While the freestanding La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membrane exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, the macroscopic magnetic transition temperature (TC) of the rippled membrane is reduced by as large as 27%. Temperature-variable Kerr microscopy observation in the rippled membrane reveals that the spatial variation of TC to be approximately 4% of the macroscopic TC, which coincides with the local strains at convex and concave structures. The large reduction of macroscopic TC in the rippled membrane may be ascribed to the lattice disorders due to strain gradient. Our demonstration of tuning ferromagnetism by the ripple structure validates the high potential of the process-induced strain in epitaxial lift-off technique and paves the way for strain-mediated emerging physical properties in various transition metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic transverse thermoelectric conversion enhanced by heat current manipulation in artificially tilted multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We phenomenologically formulate and experimentally observe an adiabatic transverse thermoelectric conversion enhanced by a heat current re-orientation in artificially tilted multilayers (ATMLs). By alternately stacking two materials with different thermal conductivities and rotating its multilayered structure with respect to a longitudinal temperature gradient, off-diagonal components in the thermal conductivity tensor are induced. This off-diagonal thermal conduction (ODTC) generates a finite transverse temperature gradient and Seebeck-effect-induced thermopower in the adiabatic condition, which is superposed on the isothermal transverse thermopower driven by the off-diagonal Seebeck effect (ODSE). In this study, we calculate and observe the two-dimensional temperature distribution and the resultant transverse thermopower in ATMLs comprising thermoelectric Co$_{2}$MnGa Heusler alloys and Bi$_{2-a}$Sb$_{a}$Te$_{3}$ compounds. By changing the tilt angle from 0{\deg} to 90{\deg}, the transverse temperature gradient obviously appeared in the middle angles and the transverse thermopower increases up to -116.1 ${\mu}$V/K in Co$_{2}$MnGa/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_{3}$-based ATML at the tilt angle of 45{\deg} whereas the isothermal contribution is estimated to be -82.6 ${\mu}$V/K from the analytical calculation. This hybrid action derived from ODTC results in the significant variation of the maximum reduced efficiency for transverse thermoelectric conversion from 3.1% in the isothermal limit to 8.1% in the adiabatic limit.</description>

      <title>Conductivity of high-mobility epitaxial GdN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report electron transport studies of a (001) GdN film grown on the square net presented by the (001) surface of LaAlO3, motivated by recent advances in epitaxial thin-film growth of several lanthanide nitrides. The film we have grown for the purpose is characterised by in-situ RHEED and ex-situ XRD and XRR to show the best crystallinity and smoothest surfaces we have accomplished to date. It shows a clear ferromagnetic transition at $\sim70$ K with a saturation magnetisation within uncertainly of 7 $\mu$B/Gd$^{3+}$ ion, a remanence of 5 $\mu$B/Gd$^{3+}$ ion and a coercive field of $\sim$5 mT. It is doped by $\sim1$% nitrogen vacancies that introduce $\sim3\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ electrons into the conduction band. The resistivity shows transport in a conduction band doped to degeneracy by $\sim0.01$ electrons/formula unit with a residual resistance ratio of 2 and a Hall resistivity permitting easily-separated ordinary and anomalous Hall components. The mobility is an order of magnitude larger than we have found in earlier films.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field imaging with an optical microscope using a quantum diamond sensor add-on</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Widefield magnetic imaging using ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond has emerged as a useful technique for studying the microscopic magnetic properties of materials. Thus far, this technique has mainly been implemented on custom-made optical microscopes. We have developed an add-on for a standard laboratory optical microscope that integrates the NV-diamond sensor and necessary light source, microwave antenna, and bias magnet, enabling NV-based magnetic imaging while retaining the typical optical measurements modes of the microscope. We demonstrate our retrofitted quantum diamond microscope by imaging a magnetic particle sample using brightfield, darkfield, and magnetic imaging modes. Furthermore, we employ an iso-magnetic field imaging technique to visualise the magnetic field of the sample within seconds, and finally demonstrate three-dimensional stray field imaging. Retrofitting existing microscopes exploits the stability and high quality of traditional optical microscope systems while reducing the cost and space requirements of establishing a standalone magnetic imaging system.</description>

      <title>Direct derivation of anisotropic atomic displacement parameters from molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated in thermoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) are crystallographic information that describe the statistical distribution of atoms around an atom site. Direct derivation of anisotropic ADPs by atom from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where the (co)valences of atom positions are taken over recordings at different time steps in a single MD simulation, was demonstrated on three thermoelectric materials, Ag8SnSe6, Na2In2Sn4, and BaCu1.14In0.86P2. Unlike the very frequently used lattice dynamics approach, the MD approach can obtain ADPs in disordered crystals and at finite temperature, but not under conditions where atoms migrate in the crystal. ADPs from MD simulations would act as a tool complementing experimental efforts to understand the crystal structure including the distribution of atoms around atom sites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stoichiometric SiNx layers (x = [N]/[Si] = 1.33) are doped with Si atoms by ultra-low energy ion implantation (ULE-II) and subsequently annealed at different temperatures in inert ambient conditions. Detailed material and memory cells characterization is performed to investigate the effect of Si dopants on the switching properties and performance of the fabricated resistive memory cells. In this context extensive dc current-voltage and impedance spectroscopy measurements are carried out systematically and the role of doping in dielectric properties of the nitride films is enlightened. The dc and ac conduction mechanisms are investigated in a comprehensive way. Room temperature retention characteristics of resistive states are also presented.</description>

      <title>Undamped soliton-like domain wall motion in sliding ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity, which is a unique polarity recently discovered in bilayer van der Waals materials, achieves polarization switching through in-plane interlayer sliding. The unique mechanism, combining intralayer stiffness and interlayer slipperiness, leads to wider domain walls (DWs) and faster DW motion compared to conventional ferroelectrics. Herein, using machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations and field theory analysis, we find the DW in classical sliding ferroelectric bilayer 3R-MoS2 system exhibits uniformly accelerated motion under an external field, like the Newtonian particle with undamped motion. Remarkably, DW velocity remains constant even after the external field removal, completely deviating from the velocity breakdown observed in conventional ferroelectrics. We further propose an experimental approach to validate this undamped soliton-like DW behavior in sliding ferroelectric systems.</description>

      <title>Dislocations and plasticity of KTaO$_3$ perovskite modeled with a new interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potassium tantalate KTaO3 is a cubic, paraelectric perovskite ceramic that exhibits surprising ductility at room temperature as most recently reported. Much like strontium titanate (SrTiO3), plastic deformation is accommodated by dislocations gliding in {110} planes. In this work we propose a new interatomic potential for KTaO3, and apply it to model dislocations with &lt;110&gt; Burgers vector. We demonstrate that dislocations dissociate, and finely characterize their core structure and Peierls potential. Dislocations of edge character can carry a positive or negative electric charge, but we show that charge-neutral configurations are energetically more favorable. We also perform high-resolution electron microscopy to validate our simulation methodology. Comparing our results with other ductile perovskites, we confirm KTaO3 to be ductile, but stiffer than SrTiO3.</description>

      <title>Relationship between polymorphic structures and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($A$' = Sm, Gd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the crystal structure and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x} A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds with magnetic rare earth elements ($A$' = Sm, Gd) have been investigated combining X-ray powder diffraction and magnetic measurements. These intergrowth compounds crystallize in a mixture of 2$H$ hexagonal (Ce$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$-type) and 3$R$ rhombohedral (Gd$_{2}$Co$_{7}$-type) polymorphic structures which are related to the stacking of [$AB_{5}$] and [$A_{2}B_{4}$] subunits along the $c$-axis.The average cell volume decreases linearly versus $A$' content, whereas the $c/a$ ratio reaches a minimum at $x$ = 1, due to geometric constraints upon $A$' for La substitution between the two different subunits. The magnetic properties strongly depend on the structure type and the $A$' content. Hexagonal La$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$ is a weak antiferromagnet (wAFM) at low field and temperature and undergoes metamagnetic transitions towards weak ferromagnetic state (wFM) under applied field. Under an applied field of 0.1 T, La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ intermetallic compounds display two different transition temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ that both increase with $x$. $T_{1}$ is associated with a wFM-wAFM transition in the 2$H$ phase for $A$'= Sm, whereas $T_{2}$ is related to the Curie temperature of both 2$H$ and 3$R$ phases. A metamagnetic behaviour is observed between $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ with transition field $\mu_{0}H_{Trans}$ between 2 and 3.5 T for compounds with $A$' = Sm. The La$_{2-x}Sm_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ &gt; 0} behave as hard magnets with a large coercive field $\mu_{0}H_{C}$ at low temperature ($\mu_{0}H_{C}$ &gt; 9 T at 5 K for $x$ = 2), whereas the La$_{2-x} Gd_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ &gt; 0) are soft ferrimagnets with a linear increase of the saturation magnetization versus Gd content.</description>

      <title>Direction-Dependent Conduction Polarity in Altermagnetic CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CrSb has recently gained immense attention as an altermagnetic candidate. This work reports on the experimental observation of direction-dependent conduction polarity (DDCP) in altermagnetic CrSb through Hall and Seebeck thermopower measurements. Conduction is dominated by holes along the c-axis and by electrons in the ab-plane of the hexagonal crystal of CrSb. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that DDCP in CrSb arises from a multicarrier mechanism, where electrons and holes living in distinct bands dominate conduction along different crystallographic directions. Furthermore, DFT predicts that DDCP exists within a narrow energy window near the Fermi level and is sensitive to small doping levels. This prediction is experimentally validated by the loss of DDCP in hole-doped Cr$_{0.98}$V$_{0.02}$Sb. These findings highlight the potential for tunable electronic behavior in CrSb, offering promising avenues for applications in devices that require both p-type and n-type functionalities within a single material.</description>

      <title>Multiscale micromagnetic / atomistic modeling of heat assisted magnetic recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is a recent advancement in magnetic recording, allowing to significantly increase the areal density capability (ADC) of hard disk drives (HDDs) compared to the perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) technology. This is enabled by high anisotropy FePt media, which needs to be heated through its Curie temperature ($T_C$) to facilitate magnetization reversal by an electromagnetic write pole. HAMR micromagnetic modeling is therefore challenging, as it needs to be performed in proximity to and above $T_C$, where a ferromagnet has no spontaneous magnetization. An atomistic model is an optimal solution here, as it doesn't require any parameter renormalization or non-physical assumptions for modeling at any temperature. However, a full track atomistic recording model is extremely computationally expensive. Here we demonstrate a true multiscale HAMR modeling approach, combining atomistic spin dynamics modeling for high temperature regions and micromagnetic modeling for lower temperature regions, in a moving simulation window embedded within a long magnetic track. The advantages of this approach include natural emergence of $T_C$ and anisotropy distributions of FePt grains. Efficient GPU optimization of the code provides very fast running times, with a 60~nm wide track of twenty-five 20~nm - long bits being recorded in several hours on a single GPU. The effects of realistic FePt L$_{10}$ vs simple cubic crystal structure is discussed, with the latter providing further running time gains while keeping the advantages of the multiscale approach.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond charge and spin dynamics in CoPt alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of advanced X-ray sources plays a key role in the study of dynamic processes in magnetically ordered materials. The progress in X-ray free electron lasers enables the direct and simultaneous observation of the femtosecond evolution of electron and spin systems through transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), respectively. Such experiments allow us to resolve the response seen in the population of the spin-split valence states upon optical excitation. Here, we utilize circularly polarized ultrashort soft X-ray pulses from the new helical afterburner undulator at the free-electron laser FLASH in Hamburg to study the femtosecond dynamics of a laser-excited CoPt alloy at the Co $L_{3}$ absorption edge. Despite employing a weaker electronic excitation level we find a comparable demagnetization for the Co $3d$-states in CoPt compared to previous measurements on CoPd. This is attributed to distinctly different orbital hybridization and spin-orbit coupling between $3d$ and $4d$ vs. $3d$ and $5d$ elements in the corresponding alloys and multilayers.</description>

Abstract: The quest for efficient and sustainable green energy solutions has led to a growing interest in half Heusler alloys, particularly for thermoelectric and spintronic applications. This study investigates the multifaceted nature of cobalt based half Heusler alloy, CoVAs, employing DFT with advanced computational techniques, such as the FLAPW method. The elastic, electronic, magnetic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of CoVAs are meticulously analyzed. Structural and mechanical evaluations reveal mechanical stability and brittleness under varying pressures. Electronic and magnetic properties are examined through band structure and DOS analysis, revealing a half metallic nature with a minority spin band gap. The total magnetic moment aligns with the Slater Pauling rule, further confirming ferromagnetism and half metallicity. Thermodynamic investigations, based on the quasi-harmonic Debye approximation, provide insights into temperature- and pressure dependent behavior, including thermal expansion, heat capacity, and Debye temperature, establishing CoVAs as a viable candidate for high temperature applications. Additionally, the optical properties underestimate its potential in optoelectronic applications due to high absorption in the UV region, showing a distinct absorption edge corresponding to the electronic band gap. Phonon dispersion relations reflect the stability of the alloy, and the figure of merit confirms the alloy's suitability for thermodynamics applications. The findings highlight the potential of CoVAs as a promising candidate for spintronic photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications, providing insights into its fundamental properties that could facilitate experimental synthesis and industrial implementation for green energy and advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast laser synthesis of zeolites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research has demonstrated that zeolite nucleation and growth can be controlled by fine-tuning chemical composition, temperature, and pressure, resulting in structures with diverse porosities and functionalities. Nevertheless, current energy delivery methods lack the finesse required to operate on the femto- and picosecond timescales of silica polymerisation and depolymerisation, limiting their ability to direct synthesis with high precision. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an ultrafast laser synthesis technique capable of delivering energy at these timescales with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Unlike conventional or emerging approaches, this method bypasses the need for specific temperature and pressure settings, as nucleation and growth are governed by dynamic phenomena arising from nonlinear light-matter interactions, such as convective flows, cavitation bubbles, plasma formation, and shock waves. These processes can be initiated, paused, and resumed within fractions of a second, effectively freezing structures at any stage of self-assembly. Using this approach, we traced the entire nucleation and growth pathway of laser-synthesized TPA-silicate-1 zeolites, from early oligomer formation to fully developed crystals. The unprecedented spatiotemporal control of this technique unlocks new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways and exploring the vast configurational space of zeolites.</description>

      <title>Composition Effects on Ni/Al Reactive Multilayers: A Comprehensive Study of Mechanical Properties, Reaction Dynamics and Phase Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ni/Al reactive multilayers are promising materials for applications requiring controlled local energy release and superior mechanical performance. This study systematically investigates the impact of compositional variations, ranging from 30 to 70 at.% Ni, and bilayer thicknesses (30 nm and 50 nm) on the mechanical properties and reaction dynamics of Ni/Al multilayers. Multilayers with varying Ni-to-Al ratios were fabricated and subjected to instrumented nanoindentation testing to evaluate hardness and elastic modulus. Combustion experiments, conducted on dogbone-shaped multilayers deposited onto silicon wafers with thermal barrier coatings, characterized the reaction front's speed, temperature, and the resulting phases. The findings revealed that composition variations within this range enable precise tuning of reaction speed and temperature without significant changes in mechanical properties, while deviations in modulus and hardness at higher nickel concentrations suggest microstructural influences. Notably, phase formation in Al-rich samples deviated from equilibrium predictions, highlighting the role of kinetic factors, such as diffusion and rapid quenching, in driving non-adiabatic processes during phase evolution. Molecular dynamics simulations provided complementary atomistic insights into mechanical responses and reaction kinetics, bridging experimental observations with theoretical predictions. This integrated approach advances the understanding of Ni/Al multilayers, offering a framework for optimizing their composition and structural design to achieve tailored performance for application-specific requirements.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the exciton polaron by serial femtosecond crystallography on single CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outstanding opto-electronic properties of lead halide perovskites have been related to the formation of polarons. Nevertheless, the observation of the atomistic deformation brought about by one electron-hole pair in these materials has remained elusive. Here, we measure the diffraction patterns of single CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots (QDs) with and without resonant excitation in the single exciton limit using serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX). By reconstructing the 3D differential diffraction pattern, we observe small shifts of the Bragg peaks indicative of a crystal-wide deformation field. Building on DFT calculations, we show that these shifts are consistent with the lattice distortion induced by a delocalized electron and a localized hole, forming a mixed large/small exciton polaron. This result creates a clear picture of the polaronic deformation in CsPbBr$_3$ QDs, highlights the exceptional sensitivity of SFX to lattice distortions in few-nanometer crystallites, and establishes an experimental platform for future studies of electron-lattice interactions.</description>

      <title>Stable antiferroelectric phase in calcium-doped lead scandium tantalate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferroelectrics are valuable dielectric materials, offering promise for both high energy storage and solid-state caloric cooling applications. However, few antiferroelectrics are known or available. Therefore, it is crucial to discover or design materials showing antiferroelectric behaviour. In this study, we fabricated highly ordered lead scandium tantalate ceramics doped with calcium. From calorimetry and polarization-electric field loops, we demonstrate the effect of calcium on the thermal properties and phase transition sequences of lead scandium tantalate. We identify an antiferroelectric phase appearing at temperatures intermediate between the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases, which becomes increasingly stable as the calcium concentration increases. These findings are supported by density functional theory calculations and Raman spectroscopy. Finally, we propose a phase diagram for calcium-doped lead scandium tantalate. Our results highlight the potential of stabilizing antiferroelectricity in ferroelectric perovskite materials through A-site doping.</description>

      <title>Neural network potential molecular dynamics simulations of (La,Ce,Pr,Nd)0.95(Mg,Zn,Pb,Cd,Ca,Sr,Ba)0.05F2.95</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tysonite structure fluorides doped with divalent cations, represented by Ce0.95Ca0.05F2.95, are a class of good F- ion conductors together with fluorite-structured compounds. Computational understanding of the F- conduction process is difficult because of the complicated interactions between three symmetrically distinct F sites and the experimentally observed change in the F diffusion mechanism slightly above room temperature, effectively making first principles molecular dynamics (FP-MD) simulations, which are often conducted well above the transition temperature, useless when analyzing behavior below the transition point. Neural network potential (NNP) MD simulations showed that the F diffusion coefficient is higher when the divalent dopant cation size is similar to the trivalent cation size. The diffusion behavior of F in different sites changes at roughly 500 K in Ce0.95Ca0.05F2.95 because only the F1 site sublattice contributes to F diffusion below this temperature but the remaining F2 and F3 sublattices becomes gradually active above this temperature. The paradox of higher diffusion coefficients in CeF3-based compounds than similar LaF3-based compounds even though the lattice parameters are larger in the latter may be caused by a shallower potential of Ce and F in CeF3 compared to the LaF3 counterparts.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Driven Nuclear Dynamics of Liquids and Solids from a Multi-Valued Machine-Learned Dipolar Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The driving of vibrational motion by external electric fields is a topic of continued interest, due to the possibility of assessing new or metastable material phases with desirable properties. Here, we combine ab initio molecular dynamics within the electric-dipole approximation with machine-learning neural networks (NNs) to develop a general, efficient and accurate method to perform electric-field-driven nuclear dynamics for molecules, solids, and liquids. We train equivariant and autodifferentiable NNs for the interatomic potential and the dipole, modifying the prediction target to account for the multi-valued nature of the latter in periodic systems. We showcase the method by addressing property modifications induced by electric field interactions in a polar liquid and a polar solid from nanosecond-long molecular dynamics simulations with quantum-mechanical accuracy. For liquid water, we present a calculation of the dielectric function in the GHz to THz range and the electrofreezing transition, showing that nuclear quantum effects enhance this phenomenon. For the ferroelectric perovskite LiNbO3, we simulate the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition and the non-equilibrium dynamics of driven phonon modes related to the polarization switching mechanisms, showing that a full polarization switch is not achieved in the simulations.</description>

      <title>Solvers for Large-Scale Electronic Structure Theory: ELPA and ELSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we give an overview of the ELPA library and ELSI interface, which are crucial elements for large-scale electronic structure calculations in FHI-aims.
  ELPA is a key solver library that provides efficient solutions for both standard and generalized eigenproblems, which are central to the Kohn-Sham formalism in density functional theory (DFT). It supports CPU and GPU architectures, with full support for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, and ongoing development for Intel GPUs. Here we also report the results of recent optimizations, leading to significant improvements in GPU performance for the generalized eigenproblem.
  ELSI is an open-source software interface layer that creates a well-defined connection between "user" electronic structure codes and "solver" libraries for the Kohn-Sham problem, abstracting the step between Hamilton and overlap matrices (as input to ELSI and the respective solvers) and eigenvalues and eigenvectors or density matrix solutions (as output to be passed back to the "user" electronic structure code). In addition to ELPA, ELSI supports solvers including LAPACK and MAGMA, the PEXSI and NTPoly libraries (which bypass an explicit eigenvalue solution), and several others.</description>

Abstract: Optical properties of the short period {CdO/ZnO} superlattices grown by plasma assisted MBE were analyzed. The superlattice (SLs) structures were successfully obtained at different growth temperatures from 360 to 550 {\deg}C. Interestingly, the growth temperature of the SLs influences quality of multilayers and also optical properties of these structures. After annealing at 900{\deg}C by rapid thermal method various defect luminescence located at different energetic positions , were detected, and intensity of luminescence strongly depends on applied growth temperature.</description>

      <title>The Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in strain-induced ferroelectric transition in SrTiO$_3$ membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical strain presents an effective control over symmetry-breaking phase transitions. In quantum paralelectric SrTiO3, strain can induce the ferroelectric transition via modification of local Ti potential landscape. However, brittle bulk materials can only withstand limited strain range (~0.1%). Taking advantage of nanoscopically-thin freestanding membranes, we demonstrated in-situ strain-induced reversible ferroelectric transition in a single freestanding SrTiO3 membranes. We measure the ferroelectric order by detecting the local anisotropy of the Ti 3d orbital using X-ray linear dichroism at the Ti-K pre-edge, while the strain is determined by X-ray diffraction. With reduced thickness, the SrTiO3 membranes remain elastic with &gt;1% tensile strain cycles. A robust displacive ferroelectricity appears beyond a temperature-dependent critical strain. Interestingly, we discover a crossover from a classical ferroelectric transition to a quantum regime at low temperatures, which enhances strain-induced ferroelectricity. Our results offer a new opportunities to strain engineer functional properties in low dimensional quantum materials and provide new insights into the role of the ferroelectric fluctuations in quantum paraelectric SrTiO3.</description>

      <title>Effect of 2$^\text{nd}$ harmonic current--phase relation on a behavior of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the behavior of a Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier assuming a current-phase relation with a second--harmonic contribution. We find that varying the weight of harmonic terms in the Josephson current affects the gain profile. The analysis of gain characteristics, phase-space portraits, Poincar\'e sections, and Fourier spectra demonstrates that the nonsinusoidal contribution influences the operating mode and stability of the device. In particular, we identify the optimal weighting of harmonic contributions that maximizes amplification, achieving gains up to $\sim 13\;\text{dB}$ in a device without dispersion engineering.</description>

      <title>Design of Engineered Living Materials for Martian Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the next step in extraterrestrial exploration, many engineers and scientists around the country revealed their intense interest to enable multiplanetary human life, including colonizing Mars. This study proposes that architecture on Mars can be realized by a synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, which produce abundant biominerals and biopolymers to bond Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into a wide range of structures. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria will 1) fix carbon dioxide and dinitrogen from the atmosphere and convert them into oxygen and organic carbon and nitrogen sources to support filamentous fungi; and 2) give rise to high concentrations of carbonate ions because of photosynthetic activities. Filamentous fungi will 1) bind metal ions onto fungal cell walls and serve as nucleation sites to promote biomineral precipitates; and 2) assist the survival and growth of cyanobacteria by providing them water, minerals, additional carbon dioxide, and protection. This report presents the major progress of the project. It has been tested and confirmed that such co-culture systems can be created, and they grow very well solely on Martian regolith simulants, air, light, and an inorganic liquid medium without any additional carbon or nitrogen sources. The cyanobacterial and fungal growth in such co-culture systems is significantly better than their axenic growth due to mutual interactions. The amounts and morphologies of the precipitated crystals vary remarkably depending on the cultivation condition.</description>

      <title>Direct Dark Matter searches with Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar materials with optical phonons in the meV range are excellent candidates for both dark matter direct detection (via dark photon-mediated scattering) and light dark matter absorption. In this study, we propose, for the first time, the metal halide perovskites MAPbI$_3$, MAPbCl$_3$, and CsPbI$_3$ for these purposes. Our findings reveal that CsPbI$_3$ is the best material, significantly improving exclusion limits compared to other polar materials. For scattering, CsPbI$_3$ can probe dark matter masses down to the keV range. For absorption, it enhances sensitivity to detect dark photon masses below $\sim 10~{\rm meV}$. The only material which has so far been investigated and that could provide competitive bounds is CsI, which, however, is challenging to grow in kilogram-scale sizes due to its considerably lower stability compared to CsPbI$_3$. Moreover, CsI is isotropic while the anisotropic structure of CsPbI$_3$ enables daily modulation analysis, showing that a significant percentage of daily modulation exceeding 1% is achievable for dark matter masses below $40~{\rm keV}$.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced structural and superconducting transitions in black arsenic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report high-pressure Raman spectra and resistance measurements of black arsenic (b-As) up to 58 GPa, along with phonon density of states (DOS) and enthalpy calculations for four reported arsenic phases up to 50 GPa. It is found that metastable b-As transforms into gray arsenic (g-As) phase at a critical pressure of 1.51 GPa, followed by subsequent transitions to simple cubic arsenic (c-As) and incommensurate host-guest arsenic (hg-As) phases at 25.9 and 44.8 GPa, respectively. Superconductivity emerges above 25 GPa in the c-As phase, with the superconducting transition temperature ($T$$\rm_c$) remaining nearly a constant of 3 K. Upon further compression, $T$$\rm_c$ steeply increases to a higher value around 4.5 K in the incommensurate hg-As phase above 43 GPa. We use our results to update the structural and superconducting phase diagrams under pressure for the novel semiconductor, black arsenic.</description>

      <title>ContinuouSP: Generative Model for Crystal Structure Prediction with Invariance and Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new materials using crystal structure prediction (CSP) based on generative machine learning models has become a significant research topic in recent years. In this paper, we study invariance and continuity in the generative machine learning for CSP. We propose a new model, called ContinuouSP, which effectively handles symmetry and periodicity in crystals. We clearly formulate the invariance and the continuity, and construct a model based on the energy-based model. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of this model with the CSP task.</description>

      <title>Cyclic behavior of masonry barrel vaults strengthened through Composite Reinforced Mortar, considering the role of the connection with the abutments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original results of experimental investigations concerning the reduction of the seismic vulnerability of masonry vaults through Composite Reinforced Mortar CRM are presented in the paper. The transversal performances of full scale, masonry barrel vault samples, i.e. running bond pattern vaults and brick in folio vaults, carrying their own weight and reinforced at the extrados or at the intrados are investigated through cyclic tests. The connection of the reinforced vaults with the masonry abutment is particularly considered and discussed, due to the importance of this detail to avoid uplift and slip at the skewback sections and better exploit the CRM benefits. The experimental behavior of the vault samples is described and analyzed in terms of global behavior, crack pattern and load displacement curves, also in comparison with the unreinforced configurations. The CRM allowed significant improvements in both vaults strength and displacement capacities, as contrasted the cracks opening and foster the spreading of cracks all along the vault. Considerable performances emerged also in terms of dissipative capacities, with a mean damping value of about 0.13 in the post cracking configuration. The vault-to-wall connection, based on embedded steel and composite bars, resulted essential for avoiding dangerous vault sliding at skewback sections, that may reduce the vault performances and also cause the fall from the support.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced proximity effect in topological insulator TaSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows stepwise resistance dependencies on an applied magnetic field. These resistance steps result from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, exhibit unusual dependence on the magnitude of uniaxial strain $\epsilon$. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal -- strong topological insulator -- trivial dielectric and proves the appearance of the surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 1\%$.</description>

      <title>Tadah! A Swiss Army Knife for Developing and Deployment of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tadah! code provides a versatile platform for developing and optimizing Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs). By integrating composite descriptors, it allows for a nuanced representation of system interactions, customized with unique cutoff functions and interaction distances. Tadah! supports Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) to enhance model accuracy and uncertainty management. A key feature is its hyperparameter optimization cycle, iteratively refining model architecture to improve transferability. This approach incorporates performance constraints, aligning predictions with experimental and theoretical data. Tadah! provides an interface for LAMMPS, enabling the deployment of MLIPs in molecular dynamics simulations. It is designed for broad accessibility, supporting parallel computations on desktop and HPC systems. Tadah! leverages a modular C++ codebase, utilizing both compile-time and runtime polymorphism for flexibility and efficiency. Neural network support and predefined bonding schemes are potential future developments, and Tadah! remains open to community-driven feature expansion. Comprehensive documentation and command-line tools further streamline the development and application of MLIPs.</description>

      <title>From superconductivity to non-superconductivity in LiPdH: a first principle approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered structure of LiPdH was theoretically suggested to be a superconductor as a result of its larger electron-phonon coupling constant compared to that of PdH. However, the experimental results reported contrary findings, with no trace of superconductivity. We study the electronic, vibrational, and superconducting properties of the ambient pressure tetragonal phase of LiPdH ($P4/mmm$) within first principles density functional theory methods, both in the harmonic and anharmonic approximations for the lattice dynamics, and conclude that it does not show any superconducting behavior. High-pressure crystal structure prediction calculations indicate that no structural transition is expected to occur under pressure up to 100 GPa in LiPdH. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that increasing pressure reduces the density of states at the Fermi surface and consequently weakens electron-phonon interactions, leading to a further suppression of the superconducting critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Mechanical Property Variability in Recycled Plastics via Bio-inspired Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating plastic waste crisis demands global action, yet mechanical recycling - currently the most prevalent strategy - remains severely underutilized. Only a small fraction of the total plastic waste is recycled in this manner, largely due to the significant variability in recycled plastics' mechanical properties. This variability stems from compositional fluctuations and impurities introduced throughout the materials' lifecycle and the recycling process, deterring industries with stringent product specifications from adopting recycled plastics on a wider scale. To overcome this challenge, we propose a composite structure inspired by nacre's microstructure - a natural material known for its exceptional mechanical performance despite its inherent randomness across multiple length scales. This bio-inspired design features stiff recycled plastic platelets ("bricks") within a soft polymeric matrix ("mortar"). We use a tension-shear-chain model to capture the deformation mechanism of the structure, and demonstrate, through a case study of commercial stretch wrap, that the proposed design reduces variability in effective elastic modulus by 89.5% and in elongation at break by 42%, while achieving the same modulus as the virgin stretch wrap material. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed bio-inspired design to enhance the mechanical performance of recycled plastics, but also demonstrate that a universally applicable, chemistry-agnostic approach can substantially broaden their applications, paving the way for sustainable plastic waste management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen liquid-liquid transition from first principles and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular-to-atomic liquid-liquid transition (LLT) in high-pressure hydrogen is a fundamental topic touching domains from planetary science to materials modeling. Yet, the nature of the LLT is still under debate. To resolve it, numerical simulations must cover length and time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. We overcome these size and time limitations by constructing a fast and accurate machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) built on the MACE neural network architecture. The MLIP is trained on Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) density functional calculations and uses a modified loss function correcting for an energy bias in the molecular phase. Classical and path-integral molecular dynamics driven by this MLIP show that the LLT is always supercritical above the melting temperature. The position of the corresponding Widom line agrees with previous ab initio PBE calculations, which in contrast predicted a first-order LLT. According to our calculations, the crossover line becomes a first-order transition only inside the molecular crystal region. These results call for a reconsideration of the LLT picture previously drawn.</description>

      <title>Flexible radio-frequency transistors exceeding 100 GHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) transistors based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{T}}$) and power gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{max}}$) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz, with low power consumption of 199 mW/mm and 147 mW/mm, respectively, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly $100\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF devices. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve output power of 64 mW/mm and power gain of 11 dB in the K-band (18 GHz), marking a significant milestone in the development of flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological advancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must effectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite design space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMG), a unifying framework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline materials. OMG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by integrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and extending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell representations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates and lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We benchmark OMG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) for specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering stable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMG, we refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMG establishes a new state-of-the-art in generative modeling for materials discovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations. These results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning frameworks to accelerate progress in materials science.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of selected N and Ti point defects in $B$1 TiN on N\,1s and Ti\,2p$_{3/2}$ binding energies (BE) by experiments and {\it ab initio} calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of TiN$_x$ films with 1.18 $\le x \le$ 1.37 reveal additional N\,1s spectral components at lower binding energies. {\it Ab initio} calculations predict that these components are caused by either Ti vacancies, which induce a N\,1s BE shift of -0.54\,eV in its first N neighbors, and/or N tetrahedral interstitials, which have their N\,1s BE shifted by -1.18\,eV and shift the BE of their first N neighbors by -0.53\,eV. However, based on {\it ab initio} data the tetrahedral N interstitial is estimated to be unstable at room temperature. We, therefore, unambiguously attribute the N\,1s spectral components at lower BE in Ti-deficient TiN$_x$ thin films to the presence of Ti vacancies. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the vacancy concentration in Al-capped Ti-deficient TiN$_x$ can be quantified with the here proposed correlative method based on measured and predicted BE data. Our work highlights the potential of {\it ab initio}-guided XPS measurements for detecting and quantifying point defects in $B$1 TiN$_x$.</description>

Abstract: Trigonal Cr$_5$Te$_8$, a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet with an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, has long been known to crystallize in a centrosymmetric structure. However, optical second harmonic generation experiments, together with comprehensive structural analysis, indicate that this compound rather adopts a non-centrosymmetric structure. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy reveals the presence of N\'eel-type skyrmions, consistent with its non-centrosymmetric structure. A large anomalous Hall conductivity of 102 ohm$^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at low temperature stems from intrinsic origin, which is larger than any previously reported values in the bulk Cr-Te system. Notably, spontaneous topological Hall resistivity arising from the skyrmionic phase has been observed. Our findings not only elucidate the unique magnetic and magneto-transport properties of non-centrosymmetric trigonal Cr$_5$Te$_8$, but also open new avenues for investigating the effects of broken inversion symmetry on material properties and their potential applications.</description>

Abstract: Previous studies on natural samples of pampaloite (AuSbTe) revealed the crystal structure of a potentially cleavable and/or exfoliable material, while studies on natural and synthetic montbrayite (Sb-containing Au$_2$Te$_3$) claimed various chemical compositions for this low symmetry compound. Few investigations of synthetic samples have been reported for both materials, leaving much of their chemical, thermal and electronic characteristics unknown. Here, we investigate the stability, electronic properties and synthesis of the gold antimony tellurides AuSbTe and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ (montbrayite). Differential thermal analysis and $\textit{in situ}$ powder x-ray diffraction revealed that AuSbTe is incongruently melting, while Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ is congruently melting. Calculations of the band structures and four-point resistivity measurements showed that AuSbTe is a semiconductor and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ a metal. Various synthesis attempts confirmed the limited stable chemical composition of Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$, identified successful methods to synthesize both compounds, and highlighted the challenges associated with single crystal synthesis of AuSbTe.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetism, initially considered interesting but useless, recently emerged as one of the most promising magnetic phases for technology. Recently, a low symmetry antiferromagnetic phase, known as altermagnetic phase, have been discovered, where no time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry is observed in spite of a vanishing net magnetization, leading to non-degenerate bands from the opposite magnetic sublattices. In this work, we consider two representatives of orthorhombic $Pnma$ space group, namely, BiFeO$_3$ and CaMnO$_3$ and find altermagnetic lowest energy phase in both from our density functional theory calculations. We find a substantial spin-splitting in both systems along a high-symmetry path in the Brillouin zone without considering the spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Detailed features of the band dispersion obtained from our calculation confirm the lifting of sublattice spin degeneracy only in the $k_y$-$k_z$ plane while preserving the spin degeneracy in the other planes of the Brillouin zone. We provide a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on the magnetic space group (MSG) to explain our DFT findings and an insightful symmetry-allowed model Hamiltonian, which qualitatively agrees with our results. Additionally, we extend our symmetry analysis to encompass two other potential MSGs within the $Pnma$ space group that may host the spin-splitting phenomenon without considering SOI and the likely form of their Hamiltonian. These detailed studies pave the way for a deeper understanding of the spin-splitting phenomena within the $Pnma$ space group, offering insights into the intricate interplay between symmetry and electronic as well as magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Pushing an Altermagnet to the Ultimate 2D Limit: Evidence of Symmetry Breaking in Monolayers of GdAlSi</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets have emerged as a class of materials combining certain ferromagnetic properties with zero net magnetization. This combination is highly promising for spintronics, especially if a material can be brought to a nanoscale size. However, experimental studies of the 2D limit of altermagnets and evolution of their properties with thickness are lacking. Here, we study epitaxial films on silicon of the Weyl altermagnet GdAlSi ranging from more than a hundred unit cells to a single unit cell. The films are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy and, expectedly, do not show any discernible net magnetic moments. Electron transport studies reveal a remarkable transformation of the electron state with the film thickness. Thick films exhibit negative longitudinal magnetoresistance associated with the chiral anomaly but do not demonstrate altermagnetic properties in electron transport due to symmetry restrictions. In ultrathin films, a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect manifests itself, indicating a non-relativistic spin splitting in the electronic structure. The transformation is associated with crystal symmetry breaking accompanying the 3D-to-2D crossover. The work highlights the role of dimensionality in altermagnetism and provides a platform for studies of altermagnets aiming at ultra-compact spintronics.</description>

      <title>Topological Charge Quadrupole Protected by Spin-Orbit U(1) Quasi-Symmetry in Antiferromagnet NdBiPt</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in crystal solids has given rise to various elementary excitations as quasiparticles. Among these, those with significant Berry-phase-related transport responses are of particular interest. Here, we predict a new type of quasiparticle called topological charge quadruple (TCQ), which is analogous to a charge quadrupole but consists of two closely-packed pairs of Weyl points in momentum space, specifically in a half-Heusler antiferromagnet NdBiPt. Interestingly, the TCQ is protected by the spin-orbit $U(1)$ quasi-symmetry, rather than any exact crystallographic symmetries. This quasi-symmetry restricts the energy splitting induced by symmetry-lowering perturbations to a second-order effect. Furthermore, the closely located Berry curvature sources and sinks in the TCQ lead to a large Berry curvature dipole, resulting in a significant nonlinear Hall effect. Our work opens an avenue for designing novel quasiparticles using quasi-symmetries and developing materials with enhanced nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Surface Patterns Shaped by Additives in Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One technique for creating semiconductor crystals with new, desired properties involves replacing some atoms in the crystal lattice with additives - atoms of a different type. This substitution not only alters the bulk properties of the crystal but also affects the patterns formed on its surface. A surface that is smooth and regular in a uniform crystal can become bunched or meandered under the same growth conditions if some atoms are replaced by additives. The Vicinal Cellular Automaton (VicCA) model is used to study this behavior, analyzing the mechanism of pattern formation when additives are introduced into the system. It has also been shown that the newly formed structures resulting from the presence of additives can be smoothed by applying successive layers of a homogeneous composition on top for a sufficiently long time. Additives can also act as smoothing agents for bunched or meandered surface patterns that develop in a homogeneous crystal. However, their effectiveness diminishes for spatially extended patterns such as nanowires. Typically, when homogeneous crystal layers are applied to spatial structures, the resulting surface is not entirely smoothed but instead transforms into a distinct shape. This phenomenon is demonstrated, and its underlying mechanism is thoroughly analyzed.</description>

      <title>Molecular tuning of excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, formed by stacking monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, create interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by their fixed covalent lattices. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as precise control of functional groups enables tunable 2D molecular lattices and, consequently, electronic structures. Here, we report molecular tuning of lattices and excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), synthesized as monolayers of perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single crystals. In HBCs, we observe an anisotropic photoluminescence signal exhibiting characteristics of both molecular and TMD excitons, directly tuned by molecular geometry and HBC composition. Ab initio calculations reveal that this anisotropic emission arises from hybrid excitons, which inherit properties from both layers through a hybridized bilayer band structure. Our work establishes a synthetically derived, molecule-based 2D quantum materials platform with the potential for engineering interlayer potentials.</description>

      <title>Effect of molar volume of diffusing elements and cross terms of Onsager formalism (vacancy wind effect) on estimated diffusion coefficients in ternary and multicomponent solid solutions</title>

Abstract: The correlation between intrinsic and tracer diffusion coefficients considering the molar volume of the diffusing elements and cross phenomenological constants of Onsager contributing to the vacancy wind effect in ternary and multicomponent systems. Manning established this correlation assuming constant molar volume. The difference in data calculated considering a constant molar volume and neglecting the vacancy wind effect, which is mainly practised until today, is compared with the data considering the molar volume of diffusing elements and vacancy wind effect in NiCoFeCr and an imaginary quaternary multi-principal element system. This indicates a significant error in estimated data when considering a constant molar volume if the molar volumes of the diffusing elements are reasonably different. Therefore, the outcome of this study is expected to bring a significant change in diffusion analysis in ternary and multicomponent systems.</description>

      <title>Emerging Microelectronic Materials by Design: Navigating Combinatorial Design Space with Scarce and Dispersed Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demands of sustainable energy, electronics, and biomedical applications call for next-generation functional materials with unprecedented properties. Of particular interest are emerging materials that display exceptional physical properties, making them promising candidates in energy-efficient microelectronic devices. As the conventional Edisonian approach becomes significantly outpaced by growing societal needs, emerging computational modeling and machine learning (ML) methods are employed for the rational design of materials. However, the complex physical mechanisms, cost of first-principles calculations, and the dispersity and scarcity of data pose challenges to both physics-based and data-driven materials modeling. Moreover, the combinatorial composition-structure design space is high-dimensional and often disjoint, making design optimization nontrivial. In this Account, we review a team effort toward establishing a framework that integrates data-driven and physics-based methods to address these challenges and accelerate materials design. We begin by presenting our integrated materials design framework and its three components in a general context. We then provide an example of applying this materials design framework to metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials, a specific type of emerging materials with practical importance in next-generation memory technologies. We identify multiple new materials which may display this property and propose pathways for their synthesis. Finally, we identify some outstanding challenges in data-driven materials design, such as materials data quality issues and property-performance mismatch. We seek to raise awareness of these overlooked issues hindering materials design, thus stimulating efforts toward developing methods to mitigate the gaps.</description>

      <title>Phase dependence of the Thermal Memory Effect in Polycrystalline Ribbon and Bulk Ni55Fe19Ga26 Heusler Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal memory effect, TME, has been studied in Ni55Fe19Ga26 shape memory alloys, fabricated as ribbons via melt-spinning and as pellets via arc-melting, to evaluate its dependence on the martensitic structure and the macrostructure of the samples. When the reverse martensitic transformation is interrupted, a kinetic delay in the subsequent complete transformation is only evident in the ribbon samples, where the 14M modulated structure is the dominant phase. In contrast, degradation of the modulated structure or the presence of the gamma-phase significantly reduces the observed TME. In such cases, the magnitude of the TME approaches the detection limits of commercial calorimeters, and only high-resolution calorimeter at very low heating rate (40 mK h-1) can show the effect. Following the kinetic arrest and subsequent cooling, the reverse martensitic transformation was completed at several heating rates to confirm the athermal nature of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Successive topological phase transitions in two distinct spin-flop phases on the honeycomb lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev magnets with bond-dependent interactions have garnered considerable attention in recent years for their ability to harbor exotic phases and nontrivial excitations. The topological magnons, which are indicated by nonzero Chern number that can enhance the thermal Hall conductivity, are proposed to partially explain thermal Hall measurements in real materials. Hitherto, topological magnons have been extensively explored when the magnetic field is normal to the honeycomb plane, but their topological characteristics are less studied in the presence of in-plane magnetic field. Here, we study two distinct in-plane field induced spin-flop phases in the $\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model, both of which are off-diagonal couplings that have intimate relation to the Kitaev interaction. The two spin-flop phases are distinguished by their out-of-plane spin components which can be either antiparallel or parallel, thus dubbing antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferromagnetic (FM) spin-flop phases, respectively. We map out topological phase diagrams for both phases, revealing a rich pattern of the Chern number over exchange parameters and magnetic field. We analytically calculate the boundaries of topological phase transitions when the magnetic field is along the $a$ and $b$ directions. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity and its derivative display contrasting behaviors when crossing different topological phase transitions. The striking difference of the two phases lies in that when the magnetic field is along the $b$ direction, topological magnons are totally absent in the AFM spin-flop phase, while they can survive in the FM analogue in certain parameter regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the theory, implementation, and benchmarking of a real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) module within the RMG code, designed to simulate the electronic response of molecular systems to external perturbations. Our method offers insights into non-equilibrium dynamics and excited states across a diverse range of systems, from small organic molecules to large metallic nanoparticles. Benchmarking results demonstrate excellent agreement with established TDDFT implementations and showcase the superior stability of our time-integration algorithm, enabling long-term simulations with minimal energy drift. The scalability and efficiency of RMG on massively parallel architectures allow for simulations of complex systems, such as plasmonic nanoparticles with thousands of atoms. Future extensions, including nuclear and spin dynamics, will broaden the applicability of this RT-TDDFT implementation, providing a powerful toolset for studies of photoactive materials, nanoscale devices, and other systems where real-time electronic dynamics is essential.</description>

      <title>Step meandering: The balance between the potential well and the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive and innovative exploration of how the surface potential energy landscape influences meander formation. Using the Vicinal Cellular Automaton model, which distinguishes surface diffusion from adatom incorporation into the crystal, the research delves into various factors affecting surface pattern dynamics. By isolating the diffusion process within a defined energy potential, the study provides a detailed analysis of how changes in the potential energy well and the barrier at the top of the step contribute to meander formation. Remarkably, the results reveal that the mere presence of a potential well at the step's bottom is sufficient to induce meandering. The role of the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier on formed meanders is further investigated, and a mechanism for meander formation is proposed to clarify this process. The derived relation successfully reflects the wavelength of the meandered patterns observed in the simulations, emphasizing its reliability. Overall, the results illustrate the crucial influence of the surface energy potential's shape in driving surface pattern formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics has long been a cornerstone of modern photonic technology, enabling a wide array of applications, from frequency conversion to the generation of ultrafast light pulses. Recent breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials have opened a frontier in this field, offering new opportunities for both classical and quantum nonlinear optics. These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light-matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials with nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of elementary excitations such as electrons, excitons, and photons in low dimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of next-generation photonic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.</description>

      <title>Implicit Time-Marching for Lagrange Multiplier Formulation for Couple Stress Elastodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of metamaterials and architected materials has intensified interest in continuum mechanics models that capture size-dependent microstructure interactions. Among these, Consistent Couple-Stress Theory (C-CST) incorporates microscale mechanical interactions by introducing higher-order derivatives in the strain energy. While previous studies have relied on convolutional principles or inverse Laplace transforms to obtain time-dependent solutions, this work demonstrates that implicit time integration applied to a mixed finite element method with a Lagrange multiplier provides stable, direct time-domain solutions for dynamic C-CST modeling. The proposed finite element scheme is tested through the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) for static cases and dynamic simulations of simple mechanical scenarios.
  Our computational experiments revealed energy dissipation, emphasizing the importance of exploring symplectic integrators in future work to impose energy conservation. Additionally, further research is required to verify temporal stability through time-domain MMS and to investigate complex mechanical scenarios, including those previously restrictive, challenging to simulate, or unfeasible with existing dynamic methods. This work lays the groundwork for studying size-dependent material behavior and provides the foundation for advanced applications in material design and wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect driven by spin-charge-coupled motive force</title>

Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetric ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) magnets have garnered much attention due to their spin-charge coupled dynamics enriched by the parity-symmetry breaking. By real-time simulations, we study how localized spin dynamics can affect the nonlinear Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnets. To identify the leading-order term, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order optical response and classify the contributions by considering their transformation properties under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. Notably, our results reveal that the sizable contribution is attributed to the mixed dipole effect, which is analogous to the Berry curvature dipole term.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$ via the generalized Fr\"ohlich and deformation potential mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism behind electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that long-range electron-phonon interactions described by a generalized multi-phonon Fr\"ohlich mechanism result in phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broader range of materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in highly c-plane oriented Mn$_{3}$Ge/Si(100) thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Mn$_{3}$Ge with a non-collinear Kagome structures present exciting prospects for exploring Berry curvature driven anomalous Hall effects (AHE). Despite substantial progress in bulk systems, the synthesis of crystalline thin films directly on silicon with a hexagonal phase presents a particular challenge unless a buffer layer is employed. In this study, we report the synthesis of single phase c-plane oriented hexagonal Mn$_{3}$Ge(0001) films on Si(100) using pulsed laser deposition. Under suitable growth conditions, we obtain layer-by-layer films with atomically flat surfaces and interfaces. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy study reveals the detail surface atomic structures, where the surface Mn atoms spontaneously arrange into a Kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy (dI/dV) measurement on the atomically resolved Kagome surface show a minima in local density of states near the Fermi level, likely originated from the Weyl crossings near K points. Despite the nearly vanishing magnetization, magnetotransport measurements in 30 nm $Mn_{3}$Ge(0001) films show anomalous Hall resistivity up to 0.41 ($\mu\Omega\cdot\text{cm}$) at 2 K. Our \textit{ab initio} calculations shed further light on the existence of topological features and the band structures in Mn$_{3+x}$Ge$_{1-x}$ with increasing Mn concentration $x$. The anomalous Hall response at room temperature in crystalline Mn$_{3}$Ge films on Si(100) offer promising potential for the development of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>
