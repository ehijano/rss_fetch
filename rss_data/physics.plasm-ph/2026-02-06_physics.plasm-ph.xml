      <title>An approximate Kappa generator for particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random number generator for the Kappa velocity distribution in particle simulations is proposed. Approximating the cumulative distribution function with the q-exponential function, an inverse transform procedure is constructed. The proposed method provides practically accurate results, in particular for k&lt;4. It runs fast on graphics processing units (GPUs). The derivation, numerical validation, and relevance to GPU execution models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Explosive eruption cycles in a rotating Z-pinch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transonic shear flow directed along magnetic field lines can linearly stabilize a steep pressure gradient in a confined magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma. In Z-pinch geometry, we show that, like the edge pedestal in tokamak devices, this transport barrier -- which we call the ``MHD pedestal'' -- is metastable, i.e., unstable to finite-amplitude displacements of flux tubes. We simulate the slow formation of an MHD pedestal in a heated and sheared Z-pinch, which collapses on reaching a critical height, expelling an order-unity fraction of the confined thermal energy. The MHD pedestal then rebuilds and the process repeats, in a manner analogous to the ELM cycle seen in fusion experiments. We show that the available energy of the metastable equilibrium, and the most energetically favorable amount of ejected plasma, can be calculated from first principles via combinatorial optimization of flux-tube interchanges.</description>

      <title>Stochastic hierarchical data-driven optimization: application to plasma-surface kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.</description>

      <title>Auroral signatures of ballooning instability and plasmoid formation processes in the near-Earth magnetotail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear development of ballooning instability and the subsequently induced plasmoid formation in the near-Earth magnetotail demonstrated in MHD simulations has been proposed as a potential trigger mechanism for substorm onset over the past decade, and their connections to the in-situ satellite and ground all-sky auroral optical observations have been a subject of continued research. In this work, a set of THEMIS substorm onset events with good conjunction of auroral observations has been selected for comparative simulation study, whose pre-onset magnetotail configuration and conditions are inferred from in-situ data and compared with the onset conditions of ballooning instability obtained in our MHD simulations. The evolution of the near-Earth magnetotail is followed, where the signatures of ballooning instability and the plasmoid formation are extracted from simulations and compared with the magnetic fields and flow patterns within the magnetotail region from observation data. The field-aligned current (FAC) density is evaluated at the Earth side boundary of the magnetotail domain of simulation, which is further mapped along magnetic field lines to the auroral ionosphere and compared with the auroral pattern and evolution there in terms of growth rate, dominant wavenumber, and absolute auroral intensities. Such validation efforts are also the first step towards the development of a self-consistent coupling model that includes the magnetotail-ionosphere interaction in the substorm onset process.</description>

      <title>The Correlation Length of Turbulence in Magnetic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale limit or outer scale of turbulence in the solar wind is associated with the correlation length of the magnetic field. Determining correlation lengths from magnetic field time series in magnetic clouds is complicated by the presence of the global flux rope: without removal of the flux rope trend, correlation length measurements will be sensitive to the flux rope as well as the turbulence, and give overestimates of the outer scale when turbulence amplitudes at the outer scale are small relative to the flux rope amplitude. We have used force-free flux rope fits to detrend magnetic field time series measured by Parker Solar Probe in two magnetic clouds and calculated the turbulence correlation length in the clouds using the detrended data. The detrended correlation length in terms of the proton inertial length, $d_p$, was $2.7\times10^{4} d_p$ in one cloud (observed at 0.77 au) and $1.6\times10^{4}d_p$ in the other (observed at 0.39 au), significantly smaller than the values obtained without detrending. Increments in the flux rope fits scaled equivalently to a $k^{-3}$ wavenumber power spectrum; this contribution from the flux rope considerably steepened the total spectrum at the largest scales but had a negligible effect in the inertial range, where scaling in both clouds equivalent to $\sim$$k^{-5/3}$ was observed. Finally, we discuss the possible relation of turbulence correlation lengths to mesoscale structure in magnetic clouds.</description>

      <title>Twisted magnetar magnetospheres: a class of semi-analytical force-free non-rotating solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetospheric twists, that is magnetospheres with a toroidal component, are under scrutiny due to the key role the twist is believed to play in the behaviour of neutron stars. Notably, its dissipation is believed to power magnetar activity, and is an important element of the evolution of these stars. We exhibit a new class of twisted axi-symmetric force-free magnetospheric solutions. We solve the Grad-Shafranov equation by introducing an ansatz akin to a multipolar expansion. We obtain a hierarchical system of ordinary differential equations where lower-order multipoles source the higher-order ones. We show that analytical approximations can be obtained, and that in general solutions can be numerically computed using standard ODE solvers. We obtain a class of solutions with a great flexibility in initial conditions, and show that a subset of these asymptotically tend to vacuum. The twist is not confined to a subset of field lines. The solutions are symmetric about the equator, with a toroidal component that can be reversed. This symmetry is supported by an equatorial current sheet. We provide a first-order approximation of a particular solution that consists in the superposition of a vacuum dipole and a toroidal magnetic field sourced by the dipole, where the toroidal component decays as $1/r^4$. As an example of strongly multipolar solution, we also exhibit cases with an additional octupole component.</description>

      <title>Numerical model for pellet rocket acceleration in PELOTON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A direct numerical simulation model for the rocket acceleration of pellets in thermonuclear fusion devices has been developed for PELOTON, a 3D Lagrangian particle pellet code [R. Samulyak et al, Nuclear Fusion 61 (4), 046007 (2021)], and validated using shattered pellet injection (SPI) experiments in JET. The pellet rocket acceleration is driven by grad-B drift of the ablation cloud that creates asymmetry and non-uniform heating of the cloud. The model accounts for non-uniform charging of the ablation cloud by hot plasma electrons as well as local plasma gradients. The increased pressure on the high-field-side compared to the low-field-side leads to pellet (fragment) rocket acceleration. Pure deuterium and deuterium-neon mixture models have been implemented. The background plasma states have been obtained by using a new plasma cooling model for PELOTON. The cooling model distributes the ablated material within the corresponding flux volumes and accounts for ionization and other energy losses, Ohmic heating by toroidal currents, and the energy exchange between ions and electrons. Plasma profiles predicted by PELOTON cooling model have been compared with JOREK and INDEX simulations. PELOTON simulations of rocket acceleration and the corresponding trajectories of deuterium fragments are consistent with experimentally measured trajectories in JET. We show that composite deuterium-neon pellets containing 0.5% of neon experienced smaller deviation of their trajectories compared to the pure deuterium case. We simulate various spatial configurations of pellet fragments and demonstrate the cloud overlap impact on rocket acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of plasma state gradients on the rocket acceleration. Future work will focus on the rocket acceleration of SPI in projected ITER plasmas and the development of the corresponding scaling law for the rocket acceleration.</description>

      <title>Self ordering to imposed ordering of dust -- a continuous spatial phase transition experiment in MDPX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous experiments conducted in the Magnetized Dusty Plasma eXperiment (MDPX) revealed an intriguing phenomenon first referred to as imposed ordering. This occurs when micron-sized dust particles become aligned with the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above the dust (at a distance much larger than the plasma Debye length or the ion-neutral or electron-neutral mean free paths) in the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the mesh. In this work, results of a transition experiment are presented wherein starting from a classical two-dimensional Coulomb crystal with hexagonal symmetry in an unmagnetized plasma $(B = 0\,T)$, dust transitions to a state in which it flows along the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above it, mapping out the 4-fold symmetry of the boundary condition. It is hypothesized that beyond a certain magnetization, elongated electric potential structures emanating from the mesh drive the dust motion to reflect the mesh morphology, transitioning from a 6-fold self ordering to 4-fold imposed ordering. The various dust phases are quantified and a critical value of magnetic field is identified in the transition experiment indicating the onset of imposed ordering.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Compression of High-Dimensional Plasma Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity scientific simulations are now producing unprecedented amounts of data, creating a storage and analysis bottleneck. A single simulation can generate tremendous data volumes, often forcing researchers to discard valuable information. A prime example of this is plasma turbulence described by the gyrokinetic equations: nonlinear, multiscale, and 5D in phase space. It constitutes one of the most computationally demanding frontiers of modern science, with runs taking weeks and yielding tens of terabytes of data dumps. The increasing storage demands underscore the importance of compression. However, reconstructed snapshots do not necessarily preserve essential physical quantities. We present a spatiotemporal evaluation pipeline, accounting for structural phenomena and multi-scale transient fluctuations to assess the degree of physical fidelity. Indeed, we find that various compression techniques lack preservation of both spatial mode structure and temporal turbulence characteristics. Therefore, we explore Physics-Informed Neural Compression (PINC), which incorporates physics-informed losses tailored to gyrokinetics and enables extreme compressions ratios of over 70,000x. Entropy coding on top of PINC further pushes it to 120,000x. This direction provides a viable and scalable solution to the prohibitive storage demands of gyrokinetics, enabling post-hoc analyses that were previously infeasible.</description>
