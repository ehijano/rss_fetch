      <title>Observational Evidence for Wind-Driven Low-Pass Filtering of Infrasound at Short Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrasound from controlled explosions provide a unique opportunity to isolate atmospheric effects on propagation. We report observations from two campaigns in May and October 2024, each featuring 10-ton TNT-equivalent controlled surface chemical explosions recorded by a dense network of 31 single-sensor stations within 23 km. Despite identical sources, the observed wavefields were very different. October signals followed a near-unimodal period-distance trend, whereas May signals exhibited a pronounced azimuthal bifurcation in both period and celerity. Downwind paths largely preserved the short-period baseline observed in October, while upwind paths showed systematically longer periods caused by wind-driven low-pass filtering. This study provides the first direct observational evidence that tropospheric winds can impose azimuth-dependent low-pass filtering at local ranges, without the influence of measured temperature inversions. Thus, the structure of the atmosphere can modify the spectral characteristics of low-frequency acoustic waves even at a distance of only a few kilometers.</description>

      <title>Regional-Scale Estimation of Soil Hydraulic Conductivity Using the Kansas Mesonet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In soil physics, saturated hydraulic conductivity, K_sat, is among the most important hydraulic properties with broad applications to modeling flow and transport under saturated conditions. Its accurate estimation, however, is challenging and requires precise characterization of pore space. In this study, we applied concepts of critical path analysis (CPA) to estimate K_sat from soil water retention curve. To evaluate the CPA, we used 313 undisturbed soil samples from the Kansas Mesonet database in which the value of K_sat spans over five orders of magnitude in variation. We found that the CPA estimated K_sat reasonably well with root mean square log-transformed error RMSLE = 0.87. For most samples, the predicted values were around the 1:1 line within a factor of 10 of the measurements. We also estimated K_sat using five other methods but none was more accurate than the CPA.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the SAIPy Performance using a Local Seismic Network for Volcano-Tectonic Earthquakes Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we evaluated the performance of SAIPy, an open-source Python package for deep learning-based seismic data analysis, by applying its single-station monitoring tools and extending its use to a seismic network based approach, using data from a local seismic network deployed in a Caldera. Although the integrated models into SAIPy for earthquake detection,magnitude estimation, seismic phase picking, and P-wave polarity classification, were originally trained on tectonic signals, we assess their performance in a more complex seismic environment that includes volcano-tectonic events, along with signal interference from distant earthquakes.We also demonstrate the advantages of integrating outputs using multiple stations to improve event detection. SAIPy was able to identify a significantly larger number of local events than those included in previously published catalogs. SAIPy demonstrated reliable phase picking and P-wave polarity estimation, particularly for local volcano-tectonic events, with some limitations observed in the magnitude estimation for complex volcanic signals. These results support the utility of SAIPy for processing continuous seismic data and suggest that future retraining using data with physically standardized units, removing instrumental response, and including data from more diverse seismic sources, could improve its generalization for magnitude estimation to complex scenarios and different seismic networks and sensor types.</description>

      <title>Machine learning determines the Mg2SiO4 P-T phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions among Mg2SiO4 and its high-pressure polymorphs (wadsleyite and ringwoodite) are central to mantle dynamics and deep-mantle material cycling. However, the locations and Pressure-Temperature (P-T) dependences of these phase boundaries remain debated, largely due to experimental limitations at extreme conditions and the high computational cost of first-principles free-energy calculations. Here, a machine-learning-potential driven workflow combining non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (NETI) and two-phase coexistence simulations is employed to enable large-scale, long-timescale molecular dynamics sampling. Within this workflow, the melting curve of forsterite is evaluated and a complete P-T phase diagram is constructed. Relative to conventional ab initio approaches, this strategy reduces computational expense while retaining thermodynamic consistency in phase-stability assessment. The workflow is applicable to efficient evaluation of phase stability and thermodynamic properties in deep-Earth silicate systems.</description>

      <title>Propagating the prior from far to near offset: A self-supervised diffusion framework for progressively recovering near-offsets of towed-streamer data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In marine towed-streamer seismic acquisition, the nearest hydrophone is often two hundred meter away from the source resulting in missing near-offset traces, which degrades critical processing workflows such as surface-related multiple elimination, velocity analysis, and full-waveform inversion. Existing reconstruction methods, like transform-domain interpolation, often produce kinematic inconsistencies and amplitude distortions, while supervised deep learning approaches require complete ground-truth near-offset data that are unavailable in realistic acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised diffusion-based framework that reconstructs missing near-offset traces without requiring near-offset reference data. Our method leverages overlapping patch extraction with single-trace shifts from the available far-offset section to train a conditional diffusion model, which learns offset-dependent statistical patterns governing event curvature, amplitude variation, and wavelet characteristics. At inference, we perform trace-by-trace recursive extrapolation from the nearest recorded offset toward zero offset, progressively propagating learned prior information from far to near offsets. The generative formulation further provides uncertainty estimates via ensemble sampling, quantifying prediction confidence where validation data are absent. Controlled validation experiments on synthetic and field datasets show substantial performance gains over conventional parabolic Radon transform baselines. Operational deployment on actual near-offset gaps demonstrates practical viability where ground-truth validation is impossible. Notably, the reconstructed waveforms preserve realistic amplitude-versus-offset trends despite training exclusively on far-offset observations, and uncertainty maps accurately identify challenging extrapolation regions.</description>

      <title>Convolution Based Self Attraction and Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self Attraction and Loading (SAL), which includes the deformation of the solid Earth under the load of the ocean tide and the self-gravitation of the so-deformed Earth as well as of the ocean tides themselves, is an important term to include in numerical models of the ocean tides. Computing SAL is a challenging problem that is usually tackled using spherical harmonics. The spherical harmonic approach has several drawbacks which limit its accuracy. In this work, we propose an alternative technique based on a spherical convolution. We implement the convolution technique in the Modular Ocean Model, version 6, and demonstrate that it allows for more accurate tides when measured against tidal datasets based upon satellite altimetry. The convolution based SAL reduces the error by reducing spurious oscillations associated with the Gibbs phenomenon. These oscillations are large in coastal regions under the traditional spherical harmonic approach.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusion models for downscaling and bias correction of Earth system model precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate change exacerbates extreme weather events like heavy rainfall and flooding. As these events cause severe socioeconomic damage, accurate high-resolution simulation of precipitation is imperative. However, existing Earth System Models (ESMs) struggle to resolve small-scale dynamics and suffer from biases. Traditional statistical bias correction and downscaling methods fall short in improving spatial structure, while recent deep learning methods lack controllability and suffer from unstable training. Here, we propose a machine learning framework for simultaneous bias correction and downscaling. We first map observational and ESM data to a shared embedding space, where both are unbiased towards each other, and then train a conditional diffusion model to reverse the mapping. Only observational data is used for the training, so that the diffusion model can be employed to correct and downscale any ESM field without need for retraining. Our approach ensures statistical fidelity and preserves spatial patterns larger than a chosen spatial correction scale. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing statistical and deep learning methods especially regarding extreme events.</description>

      <title>Axial Seamount Eruption Forecasting Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Axial Seamount Eruption Forecasting Experiment (EFE), a real-time initiative designed to test the predictability of volcanic eruptions through a transparent, physics-based framework. The experiment is inspired by the Financial Bubble Experiment, adapting its principles of digital authentication, timestamped archiving, and delayed disclosure to the field of volcanology. The EFE implements a reproducible protocol in which each forecast is securely timestamped and cryptographically hashed (SHA-256) before being made public. The corresponding forecast documents, containing detailed diagnostics and probabilistic analyses, will be released after the next eruption or, if the forecasts are proven incorrect, at a later date. This procedure ensures full transparency while preventing premature interpretation or controversy surrounding public predictions. Forecasts will be issued monthly, or more frequently if required, using real-time monitoring data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative's Regional Cabled Array at Axial Seamount. By committing to publish all forecasts, successful or not, the EFE establishes a scientifically rigorous, falsifiable protocol to evaluate the limits of eruption forecasting. The ultimate goal is to transform eruption prediction into a cumulative and testable science founded on open verification, reproducibility, and physical understanding.</description>

      <title>Super amplification of lunar response to gravitational waves driven by thick crust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Moon has been long regarded as a natural resonator of gravitational waves (GWs) since 1960, showing great potential to fill the frequency gap left behind GW detections by ground- or space-based laser interferometry. However, the spatial variation of this amplification capacity on the Moon remains unclear. Here, we numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs by fully considering the fluctuant topography and laterally heterogeneous interior structures. Our results show that most regions on the Moon can amplify GWs with a ratio over 2, a finding significantly higher than previous estimations. Particularly, the amplification ratio can even reach factors of tens at the resonant frequency of ~0.015 Hz on the highlands surrounding the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where the regional crust is the thickest. Our findings establish the thick-crust regions as critical zones of GW amplification, which is essential for future landing site selection and instrumental setting for GW detection on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Quantitative mobile gamma-ray spectrometry through Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantitative mapping of gamma-ray sources is critical for applications ranging from radiological emergency response and environmental monitoring to nuclear security and deep space exploration. Here, we show that integrating high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference with mobile gamma-ray spectrometry enables rapid and accurate quantification of distributed and point-like gamma-ray sources. Validated against laboratory and field assays, our framework quantifies natural and anthropogenic gamma-ray sources that conventional methods cannot resolve in $1\,$s with $\sim\!\!1\,\%$ error. The developed method marks a critical advance in quantitative gamma-ray sensing, enabling improved radiological situational awareness, enhanced terrestrial geophysical and geochemical mapping, as well as more robust constraints on radionuclide abundances on extraterrestrial bodies across the Solar System.</description>
