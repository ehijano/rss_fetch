      <title>The true nature of HE0057-5959, the most metal-poor Li-rich star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Li-rich stars are a class of rare objects with A(Li) higher than that of other stars in the same evolutionary stage. Their origin is still debated and valuable routes are the Cameron-Fowler mechanism, mass transfer process in a binary system or engulfment of small bodies. Metal-poor ([Fe/H]&lt;-1 dex) stars are only a small fraction of the entire population of Li-rich stars. We observed with MIKE at the Magellan Telescope the metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-3.95+-0.11 dex) giant star HE0057-5959, deriving A(Li)=+2.09+-0.07 dex. Such A(Li) is higher by about 1 dex than that of other stars in the same evolutionary stage. A previous analysis of the same target suggested that its high A(Li) reflects a still ongoing First Dredge-Up process. We revise the nature of HE0057-5959 by comparing its stellar parameters and A(Li) with appropriate stellar evolution models. This comparison rules out that HE0057-5959 is caught during its First Dredge-Up, being this latter already ended according to the parameters of this star. Its A(Li), remarkably higher than the typical lithium plateau drawn by similar giant stars, demonstrates that HE0057-5959 joins the class of the rare metal-poor Li-rich stars. HE0057-5959 is the most metal-poor Li-rich star discovered so far. We consider different scenarios to explain this star. No internal mixing able to activate the Cameron-Fowler mechanism is known for metal-poor stars at this evolutionary stage. Also the engulfment of planets is disfavored because such metal-poor stars should not host planets. Finally, HE0057-5959 is one of the most Na-rich among the Li-rich stars and we found that a strong excess of Na is common to the three Li-rich stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-3 dex. This finding could support the scenario of mass transfer from a massive companion star in a binary system, even if we found no evidence of radial velocity variations.</description>

      <title>Primordial Lithium from Globular Cluster Turn-Off Stars: M13 AND M71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the first 15 minutes of the Universe some $^7$Li was created along with isotopes of H and He. The determination of that primordial value of Li can help constrain the conditions at that time. The oldest stars with known ages can be found in globular clusters which have well-determined ages through stellar evolution models. High-resolution spectra have been obtained with the Keck I telescope and HIRES of Li in several unevolved stars in the clusters M13 and M71 with V magnitudes of 17.6 -- 17.9. Abundances of Li have been determined with spectrum synthesis techniques and show a range of a factor of 4. We attribute that spread to differences in initial angular momentum resulting in different amounts of spin-down, related mixing, and destruction of Li. Our results are compared with similar results for main-sequences and turn-off stars in other globular clusters. The range in age of these clusters is 11.2 to 14.2 Gyr for an age span of 3 Gyr. These clusters range in [Fe/H] from $-$0.75 to $-$2.24 corresponding to a factor of 30 in metallicity. The maximum in the Li abundance for these unevolved stars in all eight clusters is the same corresponding to Li/H = 3.16 x 10$^{-10}$ while the predicted Li abundance, based on the deuterium abundance and the BBN predictions, is 5.24 x 10$^{-10}$.</description>

      <title>Binary Yellow Supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds I: Photometric Candidate Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have constrained the binary fraction of evolved populations of massive stars in local galaxies such as red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars, but the binary fraction of yellow supergiants (YSGs) in the Hertzsprung Gap remains unconstrained. Binary evolution theory predicts that the Hertzsprung Gap is home to multiple populations of binary systems with varied evolutionary histories. In this paper, we develop a method to distinguish single YSGs from YSG plus O- or B-type main sequence binaries using optical and ultraviolet photometry, and then apply this method to identify candidate YSG binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. After constructing a set of combined stellar atmosphere models, we find that optical photometry is, given typical measurement and reddening uncertainties, sufficient to discern single YSGs from YSG+OB binaries if the OB-star is at least $\sim5$M$_{\odot}$ for T$_{\mathrm{eff,YSG}}\sim$ 4000 K, but requires a $\sim$20M$_{\odot}$ OB star for YSGs up to T$_{\mathrm{eff,YSG}}\sim$ 9000 K. For these hotter YSG temperatures, ultraviolet photometry allows binaries with OB companions as small as $\sim$7M$_{\odot}$ to be identified. We use color-color spaces developed from these models to search for evidence of excess blue or ultraviolet light in a set of $\sim$1000 YSG candidates in the Magellanic Clouds. We identify hundreds of candidate YSG binary systems and report a preliminary fraction of YSGs that show a blue/UV color excess of 20-60\%. Spectroscopic follow-up is now required to confirm the true nature of this population.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from the magnetically active M dwarf UV Ceti from 1 GHz to 105 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BL and UV Ceti are a nearby (2.7 pc) binary system with similar masses, spectral types, and rapid rotation rates, but very different magnetic activity. UV Ceti's much stronger large-scale magnetic field may cause this difference, highlighting key unanswered questions about dynamo processes in fully convective objects. Here we present multi-epoch characterization of the radio spectrum of UV Ceti spanning 1-105 GHz, exhibiting flared emission similar to coronal activity, auroral-like emission analogous to planetary magnetospheres, and slowly-varying persistent emission. Radio observations are a powerful means to probe the role that the large-scale magnetic field of UV Ceti has in non-thermal particle acceleration, because radio-frequency phenomena result from both the activity of small-scale field features as well as large-scale auroral current systems. We find temporal variability at all bands observed, and a hint of rotational modulation in the degree of circular polarization up to 40 GHz. The persistent component of the emission is fairly constant from 1-105 GHz, making optically thick emission or optically thin gyrosynchrotron from electrons with an isotropic pitch angle distribution unlikely. We discuss the possibility of emission mechanisms analogous to Jupiter's radiation belts.</description>

      <title>The California Legacy Survey V. Chromospheric Activity Cycles in Main Sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical spectroscopy of 710 solar neighborhood stars collected over twenty years to catalog chromospheric activity and search for stellar activity cycles. The California Legacy Survey stars are amenable to exoplanet detection using precise radial velocities, and we present their Ca II H and K time series as a proxy for stellar and chromospheric activity. Using the HIRES spectrometer at Keck Observatory, we measured stellar flux in the cores of the Ca II H and K lines to determine S-values on the Mt. Wilson scale and the log(R'HK) metric, which is comparable across a wide range of spectral types. From the 710 stars, with 52,372 observations, 285 stars are sufficiently sampled to search for stellar activity cycles with periods of 2-25 years, and 138 stars show stellar cycles of varying length and amplitude. S-values can be used to mitigate stellar activity in the detection and characterization of exoplanets. We use them to probe stellar dynamos and to place the Sun's magnetic activity into context among solar neighborhood stars. Using precise stellar parameters and time-averaged activity measurements, we find tightly constrained cycle periods as a function of stellar temperature between log(R'HK) of -4.7 and -4.9, a range of activity in which nearly every star has a periodic cycle. These observations present the largest sample of spectroscopically determined stellar activity cycles to date.</description>

      <title>Two Dynamically Discovered Compact Object Candidate Binary Systems from LAMOST Low-resolution Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report two binary systems, LAMOST J035540+381550 (hereafter J035540) and LAMOST J035916+400732 (hereafter J035916), identified through the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution survey (LRS). Each of these two systems contains an M-type star orbiting with a invisible compact object candidate. Follow-up spectroscopic observations of Palomar 200-inch telescope (P200) enhance radial velocity measurements. We use radial velocities from LAMOST and P200, as well as light curves from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to constrain orbital parameters. The masses of the visible M-type stars are estimated by fitting the MIST isochrones and SEDs. The mass functions for the unseen companions are: $0.22\pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$ for J035540 and $0.16\pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$ for J035916. With the orbital and stellar parameters derived above and assuming the orbital inclination is 90 degree (edge-on), we find that the minimum masses of the invisible companions exceeds that of the visible stars. The single-lined feature and the dynamical evidence suggest the presence of compact objects. J035540's ZTF light curve, modeled with PHOEBE, yields a compact object mass of $0.70^{+0.12}_{-0.05} M_{\odot}$. For J035916, ellipsoidal modulation analysis constrains the light curve amplitude, yielding a compact object mass range of $0.57-0.90 M_{\odot}$. The mass estimates indicate that both are likely white dwarfs. These findings underscore the efficiency of optical time-domain surveys and dynamical methods in identifying faint, massive white dwarfs, along with other compact objects in binaries.</description>

      <title>Local Spherical Collapsing Box in Athena++: Numerical Implementation and Benchmark Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a local model for a spherical collapsing/expanding gas cloud into the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamic code. This local model consists of a Cartesian periodic box with time-dependent geometry. We present a series of benchmark test problems, including non-linear solutions and linear perturbations of the local model, confirming the code's desired performance. During a spherical collapse, a horizontal shear flow is amplified, corresponding to angular momentum conservation of zonal flows in the global problem; wave speed and amplitude of sound waves increase in the local frame, due to the reduction in the characteristic length scale of the box, which can lead to an anisotropic effective sound speed in the local box. Our code conserves both mass and momentum to machine precision. This numerical implementation of the local model has potential applications to the study of local physics and hydrodynamic instabilities during protostellar collapse, providing a powerful framework for better understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the binary nature of HQ Tau: A brown dwarf companion revealed using multi-variate Gaussian process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Both the stellar activity and the accretion processes of young stellar objects can induce variations in their radial velocity (RV). This variation is often modulated on the stellar rotation period and may hide a RV signal from a planetary or even a stellar companion. Aims. The aim of this study is to detect the companion of HQ Tau, the existence of which is suspected based on our previous study of this object. We also aim to derive the orbital elements of the system. Methods. We used multi-variate Gaussian process regression on the RV and the bisector inverse slope of a six-month high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up observation of the system to model the stellar activity. This allowed us to extract the Keplerian RV modulation induced by the suspected companion. Results. Our analysis yields the detection of a $\sim$50 M$_{\rm jup}$ brown dwarf companion orbiting HQ Tau with a $\sim$126 day orbital period. Although this is consistent with the modulation seen on this dataset, it does not fit the measurements from our previous work three years earlier. In order to include these measurements in our analysis, we hypothesise the presence of a third component with orbital elements that are consistent with those of the secondary according to our previous analysis (M$_{\rm B}$ $\sim$48 M$_{\rm jup}$, P$_{\rm orb,B}$ $\sim$126 days), and a $\sim$465 M$_{\rm jup}$ tertiary with a $\sim$767 day orbital period. However, the hypothesis of a single companion with M$_{\rm B}$ $\sim$188 M$_{\rm jup}$ and P$_{\rm orb}$ $\sim$247 days can fit both datasets and cannot be completely excluded at this stage of the analysis. Conclusions. At minima, HQ Tau is a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and several factors indicate that the companion is a brown dwarf and that a third component is responsible for larger RV variation on a longer timescale.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity VIII. Stellar and wind parameters of newly revealed stripped stars in Be binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the route towards merging neutron stars and stripped-envelope supernovae, binary population synthesis predicts a large number of post-interaction systems with massive stars that have stripped off their outer layers. Yet, observations of such stars in the intermediate-mass regime below the Wolf-Rayet masses are rare. Using X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) data, we discovered three partially stripped star + Be/Oe binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. We analyzed the UV and optical spectra using the PoWR model atmosphere code by superimposing model spectra corresponding to each component. The estimated current masses of the partially stripped stars fall within the intermediate mass range of 4-8 $M_{\odot}$. These objects are overluminous for their stellar masses, matching core He-burning luminosities. Their Be/Oe secondaries have much higher masses than their stripped primaries (mass ratio &gt; 2). All three partially stripped stars show significant nitrogen enrichment and carbon and oxygen depletion on their surfaces. Additionally, one of our sample stars exhibits significant helium enrichment. Our study provides the first comprehensive determination of the wind parameters of partially stripped stars in the intermediate mass range. The wind mass-loss rates of these stars are found to be on the order of $10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is over ten times higher than that of OB stars of the same luminosity. Current evolutionary models characterizing this phase typically employ OB or WR mass-loss rates, which underestimate or overestimate stripped stars' mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude. Binary evolution models indicate that the observed primaries had initial masses of 12-17 $M_{\odot}$, making them potential candidates for stripped-envelope supernovae that form neutron stars. If they survive the explosion, these systems may become Be X-ray binaries and later double neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic and Dynamic Orbital Analyses of Metal-Poor and High Proper Motion Stars: I. HD\,8724 and HD\,195633</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, spectral, age, kinematic, and orbital dynamical analyses were conducted on metal-poor and high proper-motion (HPM) stars, HD 8724 and HD 195633, selected from the Solar neighborhood. This analysis combines detailed abundance measurements, kinematics, and orbital dynamics to determine their origin. Standard 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis provides a fresh determination of the atmospheric parameters: $T_{\rm eff}=$4700$\pm$115 K, $\log g=$ 1.65$\pm$0.32 cgs, [Fe/H]=-1.59$\pm$0.04 dex, and a microturbulent velocity $\xi=$ 1.58$\pm$0.50 km s$^{\rm -1}$ for HD 8724 and $T_{\rm eff}=$6100$\pm$205 K, $\log g=$3.95$\pm$0.35 cgs, [Fe/H]=-0.52$\pm$0.05 dex, and $\xi=$1.26$\pm$0.50 km s$^{\rm -1}$ for HD 195633. The ages were estimated using a Bayesian approach (12.25 Gyr for HD 8724 and 8.15 Gyr for HD 195633). The escape scenarios of these stars from 170 candidate globular clusters (GCs) in the Galaxy were also investigated because of their chemical and physical differences (HPM and metal-poor nature). Accordingly, the calculated probability of encounter ($59\%$) for HD 8724 at a distance of five tidal radius suggests that star HD 8724 may have escaped from NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), supported by its highly flattened orbit and may belong to a sub-population of this GC. Conversely, HD 195633's kinematics, age, and metal abundances point towards an escape from the bulge GC NGC 6356.</description>

      <title>Formation of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Black Holes and Red Stragglers via Hawking Stars in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presently, primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window from $10^{-16}$ M$_\odot$ to $10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ are a popular dark matter candidate. If they exist, some stars would capture them upon formation, and they would slowly accrete the star over gigayears. Such Hawking stars -- stars with a central PBH -- provide a novel channel for the formation of both sub-Chandrasekhar mass black holes as well as red straggler stars. Here we report on stellar evolution models that extend our previous work to Hawking stars with masses between 0.5 and 1.4 M$_\odot$. We explore three accretion schemes, and find that a wide range of PBHs in the asteroid-mass window can robustly accrete stars as small as 1 M$_{\odot}$ within the age of the Universe. This mechanism of producing sub-solar mass black holes is highly dependent on the assumed accretion physics and stellar metallicity. Lower-metallicity stars are generally accreted more rapidly, suggesting that it may be more likely for sub-Chandrasekhar mass Hawking stars formed in the early universe, such as those in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, to transmute their star into a sub-Chandrasekhar mass black hole within a Hubble time. We present a stellar population synthesis of a Draco II-like UFD galaxy containing Hawking stars and show that the number of red stragglers they produce can qualitatively match the observed population.</description>

      <title>X-ray Variability in the Symbiotic Binary RT Cru: Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hard X-ray-emitting ($\delta$-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of $\delta$-type symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multi-mission X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral components mostly contributing to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components, which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third component (9%) - which likely accounts for thermal emission in the soft band - are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in flickering-type variations.</description>

      <title>STag II: Classification of Serendipitous Supernovae Observed by Galaxy Redshift Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the number of supernovae observed expected to drastically increase thanks to large-scale surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), it is necessary that the tools we use to classify these objects keep up with this increase. We previously created Supernova Tagging and Classification (STag) to address this problem by employing machine learning techniques alongside logistic regression in order to assign 'tags' to spectra based on spectral features. STag II is a continuation of this work, which now makes use of model supernova spectra combined with real DESI spectra in order to train STag to better deal with realistic data. We also make use of the rlap score as a trustworthiness cut, making for a more robust and accurate supernova classifier than before.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Channel to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Dynamical Friction of Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both the anomalous magnetic braking of Ap/Bp stars and the surrounding circumbinary disk models can account for the formation of black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), while the simulated effective temperatures of the donor stars are significantly higher than the observed values. Therefore, the formation of BH LMXBs is not still completely understood. In this work, we diagnose whether the dynamical friction between dark matter and the companion stars can drive BH binaries to evolve toward the observed BH LMXBs and alleviate the effective temperature problem. Assuming that there exists a density spike of dark matter around BH, the dynamical friction can produce an efficient angular momentum loss, driving BH binaries with an intermediate-mass companion star to evolve into BH LMXBs for a spike index higher than $\gamma = 1.58$. Our detailed stellar evolution models show that the calculated effective temperatures can match the observed value of most BH LMXBs for a spike index range of $\gamma = 1.7-2.1$. However, the simulated mass-transfer rates when $\gamma = 2.0$ and $2.1$ are too high to be consistent with the observed properties that BH LMXBs appears as soft X-ray transients. Therefore, the dynamical friction of dark matter can only alleviate the effective temperature problem of those BH LMXBs with a relatively short orbital period.</description>

      <title>Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method for multilevel NLTE radiative transfer problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of the emerging radiation from a model atmosphere requires knowledge of the emissivity and absorption coefficients, which are proportional to the atomic level population densities of the levels involved in each transition. Due to the intricate interdependency of the radiation field and the physical state of the atoms, iterative methods are required in order to calculate the atomic level population densities. A variety of different methods have been proposed to solve this problem, which is known as the Non-Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) problem.
  In this study we have developed a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method (JFNK) to solve multi-level NLTE radiative transfer problems. Using the Rybicki &amp; Hummer (1992) method as a reference (Rybicki, G. B. &amp; Hummer, D. G. 1992, A&amp;A, 262, 209), our results show that our JFNK solver can achieve up to a factor two speed up when using local approximate operators / preconditioners, while also achieving a lower residual error in the statistical equilibrium equations. Another advantage of this method is that the addition of charge conservation and partial redistribution effects should be straight forward.
  Our method can help accelerating the calculation of the emerging spectra from numerical models and also the reconstruction of chromospheric datasets through NLTE inversions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from mergers of Population III binary black holes: roles played by two evolution channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signal from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a promising probe of Population III (Pop III) stars. To fully unleash the power of the GW probe, one important step is to understand the relative importance and features of different BBH evolution channels. We model two channels, isolated binary stellar evolution (IBSE) and nuclear star cluster-dynamical hardening (NSC-DH), in one theoretical framework based on the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH, under various assumptions on Pop III initial mass function (IMF), initial binary statistics and high-$z$ nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The NSC-DH channel contributes $\sim 8-95\%$ of Pop III BBH mergers across cosmic history, with higher contributions achieved by initially wider binary stars, more top-heavy IMFs, and more abundant high-$z$ NSCs. The dimensionless stochastic GW background (SGWB) produced by Pop III BBH mergers has peak values $\Omega^{\rm peak}_{\rm GW}\sim 10^{-11}-8\times 10^{-11}$ around observer-frame frequencies $\nu\sim 10-100\ \rm Hz$. The Pop III contribution can be a non-negligible ($\sim 2-32\%$) component in the total SGWB at $\nu\lesssim 10\ \rm Hz$. The estimated detection rates of Pop III BBH mergers by the Einstein Telescope are $\sim 6-230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ and $\sim 30-1230\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for the NSC-DH and IBSE channels, respectively. Pop III BBH mergers in NSCs are more massive than those from IBSE, so they dominate the Pop III SGWB below $20$ Hz in most cases. Besides, the detection rate of Pop III BBH mergers involving at least one intermediate-mass BH above $100\ \rm M_\odot$ by the Einstein Telescope is $\sim 0.5-200\ \rm yr^{-1}$ in NSCs but remains below $0.1\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for IBSE.</description>

      <title>Revising Properties of Planet-Host Binary Systems. IV. The Radius Distribution of Small Planets in Binary Star Systems is Dependent on Stellar Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small planets ($R_{p} \leq 4 R_{\oplus}$) are divided into rocky super-Earths and gaseous sub-Neptunes separated by a radius gap, but the mechanisms that produce these distinct planet populations remain unclear. Binary stars are the only main-sequence systems with an observable record of the protoplanetary disk lifetime and mass reservoir, and the demographics of planets in binaries may provide insights into planet formation and evolution. To investigate the radius distribution of planets in binary star systems, we observed 207 binary systems hosting 283 confirmed and candidate transiting planets detected by the Kepler mission, then recharacterized the planets while accounting for the observational biases introduced by the secondary star. We found that the population of planets in close binaries ($\rho \leq 100$ au) is significantly different from the planet population in wider binaries ($\rho &gt; 300$ au) or single stars. In contrast to planets around single stars, planets in close binaries appear to have a unimodal radius distribution with a peak near the expected super-Earth peak of $R_{p} \sim 1.3 R_{\oplus}$ and a suppressed population of sub-Neptunes. We conclude that we are observing the direct impact of a reduced disk lifetime, smaller mass reservoir, and possible altered distribution of solids reducing the sub-Neptune formation efficiency. Our results demonstrate the power of binary stars as a laboratory for exploring planet formation and as a controlled experiment of the impact of varied initial conditions on mature planet populations.</description>

      <title>Violation of $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brans Class I solution in Brans-Dicke gravity is a staple in the study of gravitational theories beyond General Relativity. Discovered in 1961, it describes the exterior vacuum of a spherical Brans-Dicke star and is characterized by two adjustable parameters. Surprisingly, the relationship between these parameters and the properties of the star has not been rigorously established. In this Proceeding, we bridge this gap by deriving $\textit{the}$ complete exterior solution of Brans Class I, expressed in terms of the total energy and total pressure of the spherisymmetric gravity source. The solution allows for the $\textit{exact}$ derivation of $\textit{all}$ post-Newtonian parameters in Brans-Dicke gravity for far field regions of a spherical source. Particularly for the $\gamma$ parameter, instead of the conventional result $\gamma_{\,\text{PPN}}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,\text{exact}}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\,\Theta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\,\Theta}$ where $\Theta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_{\parallel}^{*}+2P_{\perp}^{*}$ and total energy $E^{*}$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit{non-perturbative}$ $\gamma$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. Consequently, observational constraints on $\gamma$ thus set $\textit{joint}$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of the mass source. More broadly, our formula highlights the importance of pressure (when $\varTheta\neq0$) in spherical Brans-Dicke stars, and potentially in stars within other modified theories of gravitation.</description>

      <title>Are sunspot cycles connected to the Earth and Jupiter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sunspot number observations over the past three centuries measure solar activity. These numbers repeat the solar cycle of about eleven years. The solar dynamo converts convective motion and internal differential rotation into electric-magnetic energy that sustains the solar magnetic field. This field concentrates on sunspots on the surface of the Sun. The mainstream dynamo models predict that the sunspot cycle is stochastic. The official Solar Cycle Prediction Panel forecasts only the ongoing sunspot cycle because any forecast beyond one cycle is considered impossible. We apply the Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM) to the monthly and yearly sunspot data. DCM can detect many periodic signals superimposed on an arbitrary trend. The sunspot data fulfil four criteria. (1) DCM consistently detects the same periods in the yearly and monthly data. (2) We divide each sunspot data sample into the longer predictive data sample and the shorter predicted data sample. DCM models for the predictive data can predict the predicted data. (3) DCM models can predict the past prolonged Dalton and Maunder activity minima. Our predictions are longer and more accurate than the official Solar Cycle Prediction Panel forecast. We predict that during the next half a century the Sun will no longer help us to cope with climate change. (4) DCM detects planetary signal candidates. The solar cycle is deterministic, not stochastic, if the Earth and Jupiter cause the strongest detected, very clear 10, 11 and 11.86 year signals shown in our Figure 5. If the Earth's signal dominates over Jupiter's signal, the planetary gravitational tidal forcing does not cause the sunspot cycle. The Earth's and Jupiter's dipole magnetic fields may interact with the solar magnetic field. The geomagnetic field may even be the main cause of the sunspot cycle, if our results in Table 14 are correct.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Polluted White Dwarfs and Other Treasures with Gaia XP Spectra and Unsupervised Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) polluted by exoplanetary material provide the unprecedented opportunity to directly observe the interiors of exoplanets. However, spectroscopic surveys are often limited by brightness constraints, and WDs tend to be very faint, making detections of large populations of polluted WDs difficult. In this paper, we aim to increase considerably the number of WDs with multiple metals in their atmospheres. Using 96,134 WDs with Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra, we constructed a 2D map using an unsupervised machine learning technique called Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to organize the WDs into identifiable spectral regions. The polluted WDs are among the distinct spectral groups identified in our map. We have shown that this selection method could potentially increase the number of known WDs with 5 or more metal species in their atmospheres by an order of magnitude. Such systems are essential for characterizing exoplanet diversity and geology.</description>

      <title>Fishing for Planets: A Comparative Analysis of EPRV Survey Performance in the Presence of Correlated Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With dedicated exoplanet surveys underway for multiple extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) instruments, the near-future prospects of RV exoplanet science are promising. These surveys' generous time allocations are expected to facilitate the discovery of Earth analogs around bright, nearby Sun-like stars. But survey success will depend critically on the choice of observing strategy, which will determine the survey's ability to mitigate known sources of noise and extract low-amplitude exoplanet signals. Here, we present an analysis of the Fisher information content of simulated EPRV surveys, accounting for the most recent advances in our understanding of stellar variability on both short and long timescales (i.e., oscillations and granulation within individual nights, and activity-induced variations across multiple nights). In this analysis, we capture the correlated nature of stellar variability by parameterizing these signals with Gaussian Process kernels. We describe the underlying simulation framework as well as the physical interpretation of the Fisher information content, and we evaluate the efficacy of EPRV survey strategies that have been presented in the literature. We explore and compare strategies for scheduling observations over various timescales and we make recommendations to optimize survey performance for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets.</description>
