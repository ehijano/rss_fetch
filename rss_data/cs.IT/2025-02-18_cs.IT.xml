      <title>Amortized Locally Decodable Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) are error correcting codes that admit efficient decoding of individual message symbols without decoding the entire message. Unfortunately, known LDC constructions offer a sub-optimal trade-off between rate, error tolerance and locality, the number of queries that the decoder must make to the received codeword $\tilde {y}$ to recovered a particular symbol from the original message $x$, even in relaxed settings where the encoder/decoder share randomness or where the channel is resource bounded. We initiate the study of Amortized Locally Decodable Codes where the local decoder wants to recover multiple symbols of the original message $x$ and the total number of queries to the received codeword $\tilde{y}$ can be amortized by the total number of message symbols recovered. We demonstrate that amortization allows us to overcome prior barriers and impossibility results. We first demonstrate that the Hadamard code achieves amortized locality below $2$ -- a result that is known to be impossible without amortization. Second, we study amortized locally decodable codes in cryptographic settings where the sender and receiver share a secret key or where the channel is resource-bounded and where the decoder wants to recover a consecutive subset of message symbols $[L,R]$. In these settings we show that it is possible to achieve a trifecta: constant rate, error tolerance and constant amortized locality.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Beam Sweeping for AoA Estimation with an RIS Prototype: Indoor/Outdoor Field Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology to enhance wireless communication systems by enabling dynamic control over the propagation environment. However, practical experiments are crucial towards the validation of the theoretical potential of RISs while establishing their real-world applicability, especially since most studies rely on simplified models and lack comprehensive field trials. In this paper, we present an efficient method for configuring a $1$-bit RIS prototype at sub-$6$ GHz, resulting in a codebook oriented for beam sweeping; an essential protocol for initial access and Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation. The measured radiation patterns of the RIS validate the theoretical model, demonstrating consistency between the experimental results and the predicted beamforming behavior. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that RIS can alter channel properties and by harnessing the diversity it provides, we evaluate beam sweeping as an AoA estimation technique. Finally, we investigate the frequency selectivity of the RIS and propose an approach to address indoor challenges by leveraging the geometry of environment.</description>

      <title>Extremely Large Full Duplex MIMO for Simultaneous Downlink Communications and Monostatic Sensing at Sub-THz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-band Full Duplex (FD) technology is lately gaining attention as an enabler for the emerging paradigm of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), which envisions seamless integration of sensing mechanisms for unconnected entities into next generation wireless networks. In this paper, we present an FD Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system with extremely large antenna arrays at its transceiver module, which is optimized, considering two emerging analog beamforming architectures, for simultaneous DownLink (DL) communications and monostatic-type sensing intended at the sub-THz frequencies, with the latter operation relying on received reflections of the transmitted information-bearing signals. A novel optimization framework for the joint design of the analog and digital transmit beamforming, analog receive combining, and the digital canceler for the self-interference signal is devised with the objective to maximize the achievable DL rate, while meeting a predefined threshold for the position error bound for the unknown three-dimensional parameters of a passive target. Capitalizing on the distinctive features of the beamforming architectures with fully-connected networks of phase shifters and partially-connected arrays of metamaterials, two ISAC designs are presented. Our simulation results showcase the superiority of both proposed designs over state-of-the-art schemes, highlighting the role of various system parameters in the trade-off between the communication and sensing functionalities.</description>

      <title>The Lee weight distributions of several classes of linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}_4$ denote the ring of integers modulo $4$. The Galois ring GR$(4,m)$, which consists of $4^m$ elements, represents the Galois extension of degree $m$ over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. The constructions of codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ have garnered significant interest in recent years. In this paper, building upon previous research, we utilize the defining-set approach to construct several classes of linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ by effectively using the properties of the trace function from GR$(4,m)$ to $\mathbb{Z}_4$. As a result, we have been able to obtain new linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ with good parameters and determine their Lee weight distributions. Upon comparison with the existing database of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ codes, our construction can yield novel linear codes, as well as linear codes that possess the best known minimum Lee distance.</description>

      <title>Construction A Lattice Design Based on the Truncated Union Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers $n= 128$ dimensional construction A lattice design, using binary codes with known minimum Hamming distance and codeword multiplicity, the number of minimum weight codeword. A truncated theta series of the lattice is explicitly given to obtain the truncated union bound to estimate the word error rate under maximum likelihood decoding. The best component code is selected by minimizing the required volume-to-noise ratio (VNR) for a target word error rate $P_e$. The estimate becomes accurate for $P_e \leq 10^{-4}$, and design examples are given with the best extended BCH codes and polar codes for $P_e= 10^{-4}$ to $10^{-8}$. A lower error rate is achieved compared to that by the classic balanced distance rule and the equal error probability rule. The $(128, 106, 8)$ EBCH code gives the best-known $n=128$ construction A lattice at $P_e= 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Fast Transmission Control Adaptation for URLLC via Channel Knowledge Map and Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers methods for delivering ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) to enable mission-critical Internet of Things (IoT) services in wireless environments with unknown channel distribution. The methods rely upon the historical channel gain samples of a few locations in a target area. We formulate a non-trivial transmission control adaptation problem across the target area under the URLLC constraints. Then we propose two solutions to solve this problem. The first is a power scaling scheme in conjunction with the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with the help of the channel knowledge map (CKM) without retraining, where the CKM employs the spatial correlation of the channel characteristics from the historical channel gain samples. The second solution is model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based metareinforcement learning algorithm that is trained from the known channel gain samples following distinct channel distributions and can quickly adapt to the new environment within a few steps of gradient update. Simulation results indicate that the DRL-based algorithm can effectively meet the reliability requirement of URLLC under various quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Then the adaptation capabilities of the power scaling scheme and meta-reinforcement learning algorithm are also validated.</description>

      <title>Sensing With Communication Signals: From Information Theory to Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) paradigm is anticipated to be a cornerstone of the upcoming 6G networks. In order to optimize the use of wireless resources, 6G ISAC systems need to harness the communication data payload signals, which are inherently random, for both sensing and communication (S&amp;C) purposes. This tutorial paper provides a comprehensive technical overview of the fundamental theory and signal processing methodologies for ISAC transmission with random communication signals. We begin by introducing the deterministic-random tradeoff (DRT) between S&amp;C from an information-theoretic perspective, emphasizing the need for specialized signal processing techniques tailored to random ISAC signals. Building on this foundation, we review the core signal models and processing pipelines for communication-centric ISAC systems, and analyze the average squared auto-correlation function (ACF) of random ISAC signals, which serves as a fundamental performance metric for multi-target ranging tasks. Drawing insights from these theoretical results, we outline the design principles for the three key components of communication-centric ISAC systems: modulation schemes, constellation design, and pulse shaping filters. The goal is to either enhance sensing performance without compromising communication efficiency or to establish a scalable tradeoff between the two. We then extend our analysis from a single-antenna ISAC system to its multi-antenna counterpart, discussing recent advancements in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) precoding techniques specifically designed for random ISAC signals. We conclude by highlighting several open challenges and future research directions in the field of sensing with communication signals.</description>

      <title>Recursions for quadratic rotation symmetric functions weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Boolean function in $n$ variables is rotation symmetric (RS) if it is invariant under powers of $\rho(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = (x_2, \ldots, x_n, x_1)$. An RS function is called monomial rotation symmetric (MRS) if it is generated by applying powers of $\rho$ to a single monomial. The author showed in $2017$ that for any RS function $f_n$ in $n$ variables, the sequence of Hamming weights $wt(f_n)$ for all values of $n$ satisfies a linear recurrence with associated recursion polynomial given by the minimal polynomial of a {\em rules matrix}. Examples showed that the usual formula for the weights $wt(f_n)$ in terms of powers of the roots of the minimal polynomial always has simple coefficients. The conjecture that this is always true is the Easy Coefficients Conjecture (ECC). The present paper proves the ECC if the rules matrix satisfies a certain condition. Major applications include an enormous decrease in the amount of computation that is needed to determine the values of $wt(f_n)$ for a quadratic RS function $f_n$ if either $n$ or the order of the recursion for the weights is large, and a simpler way to determine the Dickson form of $f_n.$ The ECC also enables rapid computation of generating functions which give the values of $wt(f_n)$ as coefficients in a power series.</description>

      <title>Broadcast Channel Cooperative Gain: An Operational Interpretation of Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial information decomposition has recently found applications in biological signal processing and machine learning. Despite its impacts, the decomposition was introduced through an informal and heuristic route, and its exact operational meaning is unclear. In this work, we fill this gap by connecting partial information decomposition to the capacity of the broadcast channel, which has been well-studied in the information theory literature. We show that the synergistic information in the decomposition can be rigorously interpreted as the cooperative gain, or a lower bound of this gain, on the corresponding broadcast channel. This interpretation can help practitioners to better explain and expand the applications of the partial information decomposition technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper serves as a comprehensive guide for practitioners and scholars aiming to understand the channel coding and decoding schemes integral to the 5G NR standard, with a particular focus on LDPC and polar codes. We start by explaining the design procedures that underlie these channel codes, offering fundamental information from perspectives of both encoding and decoding. In order to determine the present status of research in this area, we also provide a thorough literature review. Notably, we add comprehensive, standard-specific information to these foundational evaluations that is frequently difficult to extract from technical specification documents.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Based Transceiver Design for Near-Field Wideband Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent metasurfaces may be harnessed for realizing efficient holographic multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems, at a low hardware-cost and high energy-efficiency. As part of this family, we propose a hybrid beamforming design for stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) aided wideband wireless systems relying on the near-field channel model. Specifically, the holographic beamformer is designed based on configuring the phase shifts in each layer of the SIM for maximizing the sum of the baseband eigen-channel gains of all users. To optimize the SIM phase shifts, we propose a layer-by-layer iterative algorithm for optimizing the phase shifts in each layer alternately. Then, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) transmit precoding method is employed for the digital beamformer to support multi-user access. Furthermore, the mitigation of the SIM phase tuning error is also taken into account in the digital beamformer by exploiting its statistics. The power sharing ratio of each user is designed based on the iterative waterfilling power allocation algorithm. Additionally, our analytical results indicate that the spectral efficiency attained saturates in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region due to the phase tuning error resulting from the imperfect SIM hardware quality. The simulation results show that the SIM-aided holographic MIMO outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoA) single-layer holographic MIMO in terms of its achievable rate. We further demonstrate that the near-field channel model allows the SIM-based transceiver design to support multiple users, since the spatial resources represented both by the angle domain and the distance domain can be exploited.</description>

      <title>Power-Measurement-Based Channel Autocorrelation Estimation for IRS-Assisted Wideband Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is essential to the performance optimization of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless communication systems. However, the passive and frequency-flat reflection of IRS, as well as the high-dimensional IRS-reflected channels, have posed practical challenges for efficient IRS channel estimation, especially in wideband communication systems with significant multi-path channel delay spread. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel neural network (NN)-empowered IRS channel estimation and passive reflection design framework for the wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication system based only on the user's reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements with time-varying random IRS training reflections. In particular, we show that the average received signal power over all OFDM subcarriers at the user terminal can be represented as the prediction of a single-layer NN composed of multiple subnetworks with the same structure, such that the autocorrelation matrix of the wideband IRS channel can be recovered as their weights via supervised learning. To exploit the potential sparsity of the channel autocorrelation matrix, a progressive training method is proposed by gradually increasing the number of subnetworks until a desired accuracy is achieved, thus reducing the training complexity. Based on the estimates of IRS channel autocorrelation matrix, the IRS passive reflection is then optimized to maximize the average channel power gain over all subcarriers. Numerical results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed IRS channel autocorrelation matrix estimation and passive reflection design under wideband channels, which can achieve significant performance improvement compared to the existing IRS reflection designs based on user power measurements.</description>

      <title>CRB-Rate Tradeoff in RSMA-enabled Near-Field Integrated Multi-Target Sensing and Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays enhance spectral efficiency and spatial resolution in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks while expanding the Rayleigh distance, triggering a shift from conventional far-field plane waves to near-field (NF) spherical waves. However, full-digital beamforming is infeasible due to the need for dedicated radio frequency (RF) chains. To address this, NF-ISAC with a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme is developed for advanced interference management, considering fully-connected and partially-connected hybrid analog and digital (HAD) beamforming architectures. Specifically, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for joint distance and angle sensing is derived, and the achievable performance region between the max-min communication rate and the multi-target CRB is defined. To fully characterize the Pareto boundary of the CRB-rate region, a sensing-centric minimization problem is formulated under communication rate constraints for two HAD beamforming architectures. A penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based double-loop algorithm is developed to optimize fully-connected HAD beamformers. To reduce computational complexity, a two-stage design algorithm for fully connected HAD beamforming is also proposed. Additionally, the PDD-based double-loop algorithm is extended to the partially-connected HAD architecture. Simulations demonstrate the proposed schemes and algorithms: 1) achieve performance comparable to a fully digital beamformer with fewer RF chains, 2) outperform space division multiple access and far-field ISAC, and 3) yield enhanced CRB-rate trade-off performance.</description>

      <title>STARS-Enabled Full-Duplex Two-Way mMIMO System Under Spatially-Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \underline{S}imultaneous \underline{t}ransmitting \underline{a}nd \underline{r}eflecting \underline{s}urface (STARS)-assisted systems have emerged to fill this gap by providing $ 360^{\circ}$ wireless coverage. In parallel,
  full-duplex (FD) communication offers a higher achievable rate through efficient spectrum utilization compared to the half-duplex (HD) counterpart. Moreover, two-way/bi-directional communications in an FD system can further enhance the system's spectral efficiency. Hence, in this paper, we propose a STARS-enabled massive MIMO deployment in an FD two-way communication network for highly efficient spectrum utilization, while covering the dead zones around the STARS. This model enables simultaneous information exchange between multiple nodes, while \emph{potentially} doubling the spectral efficiency (SE). By invoking the use-and-then-forget (UaTF) combining scheme, we derive a closed-form expression for an achievable SE at each user of the system considering both uplink and downlink communications based on statistical channel state information (CSI), while also accounting for imperfect CSI and correlated fading conditions. Moreover, we formulate an optimization problem to obtain an optimal passive beamforming matrix design at the STARS that maximizes the sum achievable SE. The considered problem is non-convex and we propose a provably-convergent low-complexity algorithm, termed as \underline{pro}jected \underline{gr}adient \underline{a}scent \underline{m}ethod (ProGrAM), to obtain a stationary solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to establish the performance superiority of the FD STARS-enabled system over the HD STARS-enabled and FD conventional RIS (cRIS)-enabled counterparts, and also to show the effect of different parameters of interest on the system performance.</description>

      <title>Self-orthogonal codes from plateaued functions and their applications in quantum codes and LCD codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-orthogonal codes have received great attention due to their important applications in quantum codes, LCD codes and lattices. Recently, several families of self-orthogonal codes containing the all-$1$ vector were constructed by augmentation technique. In this paper, utilizing plateaued functions, we construct some classes of linear codes which do not contain the all-$1$ vector. We also investigate their punctured codes. The weight distributions of the constructed codes are explicitly determined. Under certain conditions, these codes are proved to be self-orthogonal. Furthermore, some classes of optimal linear codes are obtained from their duals. Using the self-orthogonal punctured codes, we also construct several new families of at least almost optimal quantum codes and optimal LCD codes.</description>

      <title>Blank Space: Adaptive Causal Coding for Streaming Communications Over Multi-Hop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Blank Space AC-RLNC (BS), a novel Adaptive and Causal Network Coding (AC-RLNC) solution designed to mitigate the triplet trade-off between throughput-delay-efficiency in multi-hop networks. BS leverages the network's physical limitations considering the bottleneck from each node to the destination. In particular, BS introduces a light-computational re-encoding algorithm, called Network AC-RLNC (NET), implemented independently at intermediate nodes. NET adaptively adjusts the Forward Error Correction (FEC) rates and schedules idle periods. It incorporates two distinct suspension mechanisms: 1) Blank Space Period, accounting for the forward-channels bottleneck, and 2) No-New No-FEC approach, based on data availability. The experimental results achieve significant improvements in resource efficiency, demonstrating a 20% reduction in channel usage compared to baseline RLNC solutions. Notably, these efficiency gains are achieved while maintaining competitive throughput and delay performance, ensuring improved resource utilization does not compromise network performance.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Assisted Integrated Access and Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the impact of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) on the coverage extension of integrated access and backhaul (IAB) networks. Particularly, using a finite stochastic geometry model, with random distributions of user equipments (UEs) in a finite region, and planned hierachical architecture for IAB, we study the service coverage probability defined as the probability of the event that the UEs' minimum rate requirements are satisfied. We present comparisons between different cases including IAB-only, IAB assisted with RIS for backhaul as well as IAB assisted by network controlled repeaters (NCRs). Our investigations focus on wide-area IAB assisted with RIS through the lens of different design architectures and deployments, revealing both conflicts and synergies for minimizing the effect of tree foliage over seasonal changes. Our simulation results reveal both opportunities and challenges towards the implementation of RIS in IAB.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In communication theory, attacks like eavesdropping or jamming are typically assumed to occur at the channel level, while communication parties are expected to follow established protocols. But what happens if one of the parties turns malicious? In this work, we investigate a compelling scenario: a multiple-access channel with two transmitters and one receiver, where one transmitter deviates from the protocol and acts dishonestly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Byzantine multiple-access classical-quantum channel and derive an achievable communication rate for this adversarial setting.</description>

      <title>Token Communications: A Unified Framework for Cross-modal Context-aware Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a unified framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. We demonstrate the corresponding TokCom benefits in a GenSC setup for image, leveraging cross-modal context information, which increases the bandwidth efficiency by 70.8% with negligible loss of semantic/perceptual quality. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>When Wyner and Ziv Met Bayes in Quantum-Classical Realm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the lossy quantum-classical source coding with the quantum side-information (QC-QSI) problem. The task is to compress the classical information about a quantum source, obtained after performing a measurement while incurring a bounded reconstruction error. Here, the decoder is allowed to use the side information to recover the classical data obtained from measurements on the source states. We introduce a new formulation based on a backward (posterior) channel, replacing the single-letter distortion observable with a single-letter posterior channel to capture reconstruction error. Unlike the rate-distortion framework, this formulation imposes a block error constraint. An analogous formulation is developed for lossy classical source coding with classical side information (C-CSI) problem. We derive an inner bound on the asymptotic performance limit in terms of single-letter quantum and classical mutual information quantities of the given posterior channel for QC-QSI and C-CSI cases, respectively. Furthermore, we establish a connection between rate-distortion and rate-channel theory, showing that a rate-channel compression protocol attains the optimal rate-distortion function for a specific distortion measure and level.</description>

      <title>On Self-Adaptive Perception Loss Function for Sequential Lossy Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider causal, low-latency, sequential lossy compression, with mean squared-error (MSE) as the distortion loss, and a perception loss function (PLF) to enhance the realism of reconstructions. As the main contribution, we propose and analyze a new PLF that considers the joint distribution between the current source frame and the previous reconstructions. We establish the theoretical rate-distortion-perception function for first-order Markov sources and analyze the Gaussian model in detail. From a qualitative perspective, the proposed metric can simultaneously avoid the error-permanence phenomenon and also better exploit the temporal correlation between high-quality reconstructions. The proposed metric is referred to as self-adaptive perception loss function (PLF-SA), as its behavior adapts to the quality of reconstructed frames. We provide a detailed comparison of the proposed perception loss function with previous approaches through both information theoretic analysis as well as experiments involving moving MNIST and UVG datasets.</description>

      <title>ResiComp: Loss-Resilient Image Compression via Dual-Functional Masked Visual Token Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural image codecs (NICs) are of significant compression performance, but limited attention has been paid to their error resilience.
  These resulting NICs tend to be sensitive to packet losses, which are prevalent in real-time communications.
  In this paper, we investigate how to elevate the resilience ability of NICs to combat packet losses.
  We propose ResiComp, a pioneering neural image compression framework with feature-domain packet loss concealment (PLC).
  Motivated by the inherent consistency between generation and compression, we advocate merging the tasks of entropy modeling and PLC into a unified framework focused on latent space context modeling.
  To this end, we take inspiration from the impressive generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly the recent advances of masked visual token modeling (MVTM).
  During training, we integrate MVTM to mirror the effects of packet loss, enabling a dual-functional Transformer to restore the masked latents by predicting their missing values and conditional probability mass functions.
  Our ResiComp jointly optimizes compression efficiency and loss resilience.
  Moreover, ResiComp provides flexible coding modes, allowing for explicitly adjusting the efficiency-resilience trade-off in response to varying Internet or wireless network conditions.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResiComp can significantly enhance the NIC's resilience against packet losses, while exhibits a worthy trade-off between compression efficiency and packet loss resilience.</description>

      <title>Improved Offline Contextual Bandits with Second-Order Bounds: Betting and Freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the off-policy selection and learning in contextual bandits where the learner aims to select or train a reward-maximizing policy using data collected by a fixed behavior policy. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a novel off-policy selection method that leverages a new betting-based confidence bound applied to an inverse propensity weight sequence. Our theoretical analysis reveals that our method achieves a significantly better, variance-adaptive guarantee upon prior art. Second, we propose a novel and generic condition on the optimization objective for off-policy learning that strikes a difference balance in bias and variance. One special case that we call freezing tends to induce small variance, which is preferred in small-data regimes. Our analysis shows that they match the best existing guarantee. In our empirical study, our selection method outperforms existing methods, and freezing exhibits improved performance in small-sample regimes.</description>

      <title>Exploring information geometry: Recent Advances and Connections to Topological Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This introductory text arises from a lecture given in G\"oteborg, Sweden, given by the first author and is intended for undergraduate students, as well as for any mathematically inclined reader wishing to explore a synthesis of ideas connecting geometry and statistics. At its core, this work seeks to illustrate the profound and yet natural interplay between differential geometry, probability theory, and the rich algebraic structures encoded in (pre-)Frobenius manifolds.
  The exposition is structured into three principal parts. The first part provides a concise introduction to differential topology and geometry, emphasizing the role of smooth manifolds, connections, and curvature in the formulation of geometric structures. The second part is devoted to probability, measures, and statistics, where the notion of a probability space is refined into a geometric object, thus paving the way for a deeper mathematical understanding of statistical models. Finally, in the third part, we introduce (pre-)Frobenius manifolds, revealing their surprising connection to exponential families of probability distributions and, discuss more broadly, their role in the geometry of information. At the end of those three parts the reader will find stimulating exercises.
  By bringing together these seemingly distant disciplines, we aim to highlight the natural emergence of geometric structures in statistical theory. This work does not seek to be exhaustive but rather to provide the reader with a pathway into a domain of mathematics that is still in its formative stages, where many fundamental questions remain open. The text is accessible without requiring advanced prerequisites and should serve as an invitation to further exploration.</description>

      <title>Span-Agnostic Optimal Sample Complexity and Oracle Inequalities for Average-Reward RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of finding an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a generative model. The minimax optimal span-based complexity of $\widetilde{O}(SAH/\varepsilon^2)$, where $H$ is the span of the optimal bias function, has only been achievable with prior knowledge of the value of $H$. Prior-knowledge-free algorithms have been the objective of intensive research, but several natural approaches provably fail to achieve this goal. We resolve this problem, developing the first algorithms matching the optimal span-based complexity without $H$ knowledge, both when the dataset size is fixed and when the suboptimality level $\varepsilon$ is fixed. Our main technique combines the discounted reduction approach with a method for automatically tuning the effective horizon based on empirical confidence intervals or lower bounds on performance, which we term horizon calibration. We also develop an empirical span penalization approach, inspired by sample variance penalization, which satisfies an oracle inequality performance guarantee. In particular this algorithm can outperform the minimax complexity in benign settings such as when there exist near-optimal policies with span much smaller than $H$.</description>

      <title>Non-Binary LDPC Arithmetic Error Correction For Processing-in-Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) based on emerging devices such as memristors is more vulnerable to noise than traditional memories, due to the physical non-idealities and complex operations in analog domains. To ensure high reliability, efficient error-correcting code (ECC) is highly desired. However, state-of-the-art ECC schemes for PIM suffer drawbacks including dataflow interruptions, low code rates, and limited error correction patterns. In this work, we propose non-binary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) error correction running over the Galois field. Such NB-LDPC scheme with a long word length of 1024 bits can correct up to 8-bit errors with a code rate over 88%. Nonbinary GF operations can support both memory mode and PIM mode even with multi-level memory cells. We fabricate a 40nm prototype PIM chip equipped with our proposed NB-LDPC scheme for validation purposes. Experiments show that PIM with NB-LDPC error correction demonstrates up to 59.65 times bit error rate (BER) improvement over the original PIM without such error correction. The test chip delivers 2.978 times power efficiency enhancement over prior works.</description>

Abstract: The syndrome decoding problem is one of the NP-complete problems lying at the foundation of code-based cryptography. The variant thereof where the distance between vectors is measured with respect to the Lee metric, rather than the more commonly used Hamming metric, has been analyzed recently in several works due to its potential relevance for building more efficient code-based cryptosystems. The purpose of this article is to describe a zero-knowledge proof for this variant of the problem.</description>

      <title>Unitary orthonormal bases of finite dimensional inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study unitary orthonormal bases in the sense of Pimsner and Popa for inclusions $(\mathcal{B}\subseteq \mathcal{A}, E),$ where $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}$ are finite dimensional von Neumann algebras and $E$ is a conditional expectation map from $\mathcal{A}$ onto $\mathcal{B}$. It is shown that existence of such bases requires that the associated inclusion matrix satisfies a spectral condition forcing dimension vectors to be Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors and the conditional expectation map preserves the Markov trace. Subject to these conditions, explicit unitary orthonormal bases are constructed if either one of the algebras is abelian or simple. They generalize complex Hadamard matrices, Weyl unitary bases, and a recent work of Crann et al which correspond to the special cases of $\mathcal{A}$ being abelian, simple, and general multi-matrix algebras respectively with $\mathcal{B}$ being the algebra of complex numbers. For the first time $\mathcal{B}$ is more general. As an application of these results it is shown that if $(\mathcal{B}\subseteq \mathcal{A}, E),$ admits a unitary orthonormal basis then the Connes-St{\o}rmer relative entropy $H(\mathcal{A}_1|\mathcal{A})$ equals the logarithm of the square of the norm of the inclusion matrix, where $\mathcal{A}_1$ denotes the Jones basic construction of the inclusion. As a further application, we prove the existence of unitary orthonormal bases for a large class of depth 2 subfactors with abelian relative commutant.</description>

      <title>Ansatz-free Hamiltonian learning with Heisenberg-limited scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the unknown interactions that govern a quantum system is crucial for quantum information processing, device benchmarking, and quantum sensing. The problem, known as Hamiltonian learning, is well understood under the assumption that interactions are local, but this assumption may not hold for arbitrary Hamiltonians. Previous methods all require high-order inverse polynomial dependency with precision, unable to surpass the standard quantum limit and reach the gold standard Heisenberg-limited scaling. Whether Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning is possible without prior assumptions about the interaction structures, a challenge we term \emph{ansatz-free Hamiltonian learning}, remains an open question. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm to learn arbitrary sparse Hamiltonians without any structure constraints using only black-box queries of the system's real-time evolution and minimal digital controls to attain Heisenberg-limited scaling in estimation error. Our method is also resilient to state-preparation-and-measurement errors, enhancing its practical feasibility. Moreover, we establish a fundamental trade-off between total evolution time and quantum control on learning arbitrary interactions, revealing the intrinsic interplay between controllability and total evolution time complexity for any learning algorithm. These results pave the way for further exploration into Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning in complex quantum systems under minimal assumptions, potentially enabling new benchmarking and verification protocols.</description>

Abstract: We find information geometry of tempered stable processes. Starting with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, Fisher information matrices of tempered stable processes and $\alpha$-connections of their statistical manifolds are obtained. Additionally, we also provide statistical applications for the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly decreasing tempered stable processes are given as examples.</description>

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised beamforming neural network (BNN) and a supervised reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) convolutional neural network (CNN) to optimize transmit beamforming and RIS coefficients of multi-input single-output (MISO) downlink with RIS assistance. To avoid frequent beam updates, the proposed BNN and RIS CNN are based on slow-changing channel covariances and are different from most other neural networks that utilize channel instances. Numerical simulations show that the proposed BNN with RIS CNN can achieve much higher sum rates than zeroforcing beamforming with waterfilling power allocation does, especially for systems with higher load, and reduces computation time.</description>

      <title>The greedy side of the LASSO: New algorithms for weighted sparse recovery via loss function-based orthogonal matching pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a class of greedy algorithms for weighted sparse recovery by considering new loss function-based generalizations of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Given a (regularized) loss function, the proposed algorithms alternate the iterative construction of the signal support via greedy index selection and a signal update based on solving a local data-fitting problem restricted to the current support. We show that greedy selection rules associated with popular weighted sparsity-promoting loss functions admit explicitly computable and simple formulas. Specifically, we consider $ \ell^0 $- and $ \ell^1 $-based versions of the weighted LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), the Square-Root LASSO (SR-LASSO) and the Least Absolute Deviations LASSO (LAD-LASSO). Through numerical experiments on Gaussian compressive sensing and high-dimensional function approximation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and empirically show that they inherit desirable characteristics from the corresponding loss functions, such as SR-LASSO's noise-blind optimal parameter tuning and LAD-LASSO's fault tolerance. In doing so, our study sheds new light on the connection between greedy sparse recovery and convex relaxation.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Rich Feedback HARQ for Energy-Efficient Uplink Short Packet Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trade-off between reliability, latency, and energy efficiency is a central problem in communication systems. Advanced hybrid automated repeat request (HARQ) techniques reduce retransmissions required for reliable communication but incur high computational costs. Strict energy constraints apply mainly to devices, while the access point receiving their packets is usually connected to the electrical grid. Therefore, moving the computational complexity from the transmitter to the receiver may provide a way to improve this trade-off. We propose the reinforcement-based adaptive feedback (RAF) scheme, a departure from traditional single-bit feedback HARQ, introducing adaptive rich feedback where the receiver requests the coded retransmission of specific symbols. Simulation results show that RAF achieves a better trade-off between energy efficiency, reliability, and latency, compared to existing HARQ solutions. Our RAF scheme can easily adapt to different modulation schemes and can also generalize to different channel statistics.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Limits of Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system avoids the strong self-interference in a monostatic ISAC system by employing a pair of physically separated sensing transceivers and maintaining the merit of co-designing radar sensing and communication on shared spectrum and hardware. In this paper, we study a bistatic ISAC system with the aim of characterizing its capacity-distortion function, i.e., the maximum achievable communication rate when the sensing accuracy satisfies a given distortion constraint. Based on the proposed information-theoretic model of the bistatic ISAC system, we provide a multi-letter representation of the capacity-distortion function. For ease of calculation, we derive several single-letter lower bounds and upper bounds on the capacity-distortion function. In particular, we provide single-letter representations of the capacity-distortion function for the degraded bistatic ISAC channels. Furthermore, we extend the results to a bistatic ISAC broadcast channel model and obtain the capacity-distortion region with a single-letter characterization in a degraded case. Examples are provided to explicitly illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the advantages of ISAC over independent communication and sensing, as well as the benefits of leveraging communication to assist sensing in a bistatic system.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Sensing in OTFS-based UAV Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of accurately localizing $N$ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in 3D space where the UAVs are part of a swarm and communicate with each other through orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulated signals. The OTFS communication system operates in the delay-Doppler domain and can simultaneously provide range and velocity information about the scatterers in the channels at no additional cost. Each receiving UAV estimates the multipath wireless channel on each link formed by the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission and by the single reflections from the remaining $N-2$ UAVs. The estimated channel delay profiles are communicated to an edge server to estimate the location and velocity of the UAVs from the relative echo delay (RED) measurements between the LoS and the non-LoS paths. To accurately obtain such estimations, we propose a solution called Turbo Iterative Positioning (TIP), initialized by a belief-propagation approach. Enabling a full cold start (no prior knowledge of initial positions), the belief propagation first provides a map associating each echo to a reflecting UAV. The localization of the $N$ UAVs is then derived by iteratively alternating a gradient descent optimization and a refinement of the association maps between UAVs and echos. Given that the OTFS receivers also acquire the Doppler shifts of each path, the UAV's velocities can be sensed jointly with communication. Our numerical results, obtained also using real-world traces, show how the multipath links are beneficial to achieving very accurate position and velocity for all UAVs, even with a limited delay-Doppler resolution. The robustness of our scheme is proven by its performance approaching the Cramer-Rao bound.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming with Widely-spaced-array for Multi-user Cross-Near-and-Far-Field Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With multi-GHz bandwidth, Terahertz (THz) beamforming has drawn increasing attention in the sixth generation (6G) and beyond communications. Existing beamforming designs mainly focus on a compact antenna array where typical communication occurs in the far-field. However, in dense multi-user scenarios, only relying on far-field angle domain fails to distinguish users at similar angles. Therefore, a multi-user widely-spaced array (MU-WSA) is exploited in this paper, which enlarges the near-field region to introduce the additional distance domain, leading to a new paradigm of cross-near-and-far-field (CNFF) communication. Under this paradigm, the CNFF channel model is investigated, based on which the subarray spacing $d_s$ and the number of subarrays $K$ in MU-WSA are optimized to maximize the channel capacity. Then, in sub-connected systems, an alternating optimization (AO) beamforming algorithm is proposed to deal with the special block-diagonal format of the analog precoder. For fully-connected systems, a low-complexity steering-vector reconstruction (SVR)-based algorithm is proposed by constructing specialized steering vectors of MU-WSA. Numerical evaluations show that due to distance domain resolutions, the MU-WSA can improve the SE by over $60$% at a power of $20$dBm compared to the compact array. Additionally, the proposed AO algorithm in the SC system can achieve over 80% of the sum (SE) of the FC system while reducing the number of phase shifters by $K^2$, thereby lowering power consumption. The SVR algorithm in the FC system can achieve over 95% of the upper bound of SE but takes only 10% of the running time of the singular vector decomposition (SVD)-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication via Textual Prompts: Latency Performance Tradeoffs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an edge-device collaborative Generative Semantic Communications (Gen SemCom) framework leveraging pre-trained Multi-modal/Vision Language Models (M/VLMs) for ultra-low-rate semantic communication via textual prompts. The proposed framework optimizes the use of M/VLMs on the wireless edge/device to generate high-fidelity textual prompts through visual captioning/question answering, which are then transmitted over a wireless channel for SemCom. Specifically, we develop a multi-user Gen SemCom framework using pre-trained M/VLMs, and formulate a joint optimization problem of prompt generation offloading, communication and computation resource allocation to minimize the latency and maximize the resulting semantic quality. Due to the nonconvex nature of the problem with highly coupled discrete and continuous variables, we decompose it as a two-level problem and propose a low-complexity swap/leaving/joining (SLJ)-based matching algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements over the conventional semanticunaware/non-collaborative offloading benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Multi-User Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal beamforming design for multi-user continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems is proposed. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), the beamformer for CAPA is a continuous function rather than a discrete vector or matrix, rendering beamforming optimization a non-convex integral-based functional programming. To address this challenging issue, the closed-form optimal structure of the CAPA beamformer is first derived for maximizing generic system utility functions, by addressing the inversion of continuous functions and using the Lagrangian duality and the calculus of variations. The derived optimal structure is a linear combination of the continuous channel responses for CAPA, with the linear weights determined by the channel correlations. As a further advance, a monotonic optimization method is proposed for obtaining globally optimal CAPA beamforming based on the derived optimal structure. More particularly, a closed-form fixed-point iteration is proposed to obtain the globally optimal solution to the power minimization problem for CAPA beamforming. Furthermore, based on the optimal structure, the low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) designs for CAPA beamforming are derived. It is theoretically proved that: 1) the MRT and ZF designs are asymptotically optimal in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, respectively, and 2) the MMSE design is optimal for signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) maximization. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) CAPA achieves significant communication performance gain over SPDA, and ii) the MMSE design achieves nearly optimal performance in most cases, while the MRT and ZF designs achieve nearly optimal performance in specific cases</description>

      <title>High-Rate Spatially Coupled LDPC Codes Based on Massey's Convolutional Self-Orthogonal Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a new class of high-rate spatially coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes based on the convolutional self-orthogonal codes (CSOCs) first introduced by Massey. The SC-LDPC codes are constructed by treating the irregular graph corresponding to the parity-check matrix of a systematic rate R = (n - 1)/n CSOC as a convolutional protograph. The protograph can then be lifted using permutation matrices to generate a high-rate SC-LDPC code whose strength depends on the lifting factor. The SC-LDPC codes constructed in this fashion can be decoded using iterative belief propagation (BP) based sliding window decoding (SWD).
  A non-systematic version of a CSOC parity-check matrix is then proposed by making a slight modification to the systematic construction. The non-systematic parity-check matrix corresponds to a regular protograph whose degree profile depends on the rate and error-correcting capability of the underlying CSOC. Even though the parity-check matrix is in non-systematic form, we show how systematic encoding can still be performed. We also show that the non-systematic convolutional protograph has a guaranteed girth and free distance and that these properties carry over to the lifted versions.
  Finally, numerical results are included demonstrating that CSOC-based SC-LDPC codes (i) achieve excellent performance at very high rates, (ii) have performance at least as good as that of SC-LDPC codes constructed from convolutional protographs commonly found in the literature, and (iii) have iterative decoding thresholds comparable to those of existing SC-LDPC code designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04475v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem has been a milestone in quantum information theory. It states that asymptotically reliable simulation of a quantum channel, assisted by unlimited shared entanglement, requires a rate of classical communication equal to the channel's entanglement-assisted classical capacity. In this paper, we study the error exponent of quantum channel simulation, which characterizes the optimal speed of exponential convergence of the performance towards the perfect, as the blocklength increases. Based on channel purified distance, we derive lower and upper bounds for the error exponent. Then we show that the two bounds coincide when the classical communication rate is below a critical value, and hence, we have determined the exact formula of the error exponent in the low-rate case. This enables us to obtain an operational interpretation to the channel's sandwiched R\'enyi information of order from 1 to 2, since our formula is expressed as a transform of this quantity. In the derivation, we have also obtained an achievability bound for quantum channel simulation in the finite-blocklength setting, which is of realistic significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are promising candidates for error correction in quantum computers. One of the major challenges in implementing QLDPC codes in quantum computers is the lack of a universal decoder. In this work, we first propose to decode QLDPC codes with a belief propagation (BP) decoder operating on overcomplete check matrices. Then, we extend the neural BP (NBP) decoder, which was originally studied for suboptimal binary BP decoding of QLPDC codes, to quaternary BP decoders. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that both approaches as well as their combination yield a low-latency, high-performance decoder for several short to moderate length QLDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Normality, Relativization, and Randomness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normal numbers were introduced by Borel and later proven to be a weak notion of algorithmic randomness. We introduce here a natural relativization of normality based on generalized number representation systems. We explore the concepts of supernormal numbers that correspond to semicomputable relativizations, and that of highly normal numbers in terms of computable ones.
  We prove several properties of these new randomness concepts. Both supernormality and high normality generalize Borel absolute normality. Supernormality is strictly between 2-randomness and effective dimension 1, while high normality corresponds exactly to sequences of computable dimension 1 providing a more natural characterization of this class.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Perspective on Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free uncertainty estimation framework that constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true answer with a user-specified probability. Intuitively, the size of the prediction set encodes a general notion of uncertainty, with larger sets associated with higher degrees of uncertainty. In this work, we leverage information theory to connect conformal prediction to other notions of uncertainty. More precisely, we prove three different ways to upper bound the intrinsic uncertainty, as described by the conditional entropy of the target variable given the inputs, by combining CP with information theoretical inequalities. Moreover, we demonstrate two direct and useful applications of such connection between conformal prediction and information theory: (i) more principled and effective conformal training objectives that generalize previous approaches and enable end-to-end training of machine learning models from scratch, and (ii) a natural mechanism to incorporate side information into conformal prediction. We empirically validate both applications in centralized and federated learning settings, showing our theoretical results translate to lower inefficiency (average prediction set size) for popular CP methods.</description>

      <title>The geometry of efficient codes: how rate-distortion trade-offs distort the latent representations of generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living organisms rely on internal models of the world to act adaptively. These models, because of resource limitations, cannot encode every detail and hence need to compress information. From a cognitive standpoint, information compression can manifest as a distortion of latent representations, resulting in the emergence of representations that may not accurately reflect the external world or its geometry. Rate-distortion theory formalizes the optimal way to compress information while minimizing such distortions, by considering factors such as capacity limitations, the frequency and the utility of stimuli. However, while this theory explains why the above factors distort latent representations, it does not specify which specific distortions they produce. To address this question, here we investigate how rate-distortion trade-offs shape the latent representations of images in generative models, specifically Beta Variational Autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs), under varying constraints of model capacity, data distributions, and task objectives. By systematically exploring these factors, we identify three primary distortions in latent representations: prototypization, specialization, and orthogonalization. These distortions emerge as signatures of information compression, reflecting the model's adaptation to capacity limitations, data imbalances, and task demands. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that these distortions can coexist, giving rise to a rich landscape of latent spaces, whose geometry could differ significantly across generative models subject to different constraints. Our findings contribute to explain how the normative constraints of rate-distortion theory shape the geometry of latent representations of generative models of artificial systems and living organisms.</description>

      <title>Reliability Function of Classical-Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12403v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reliability function of general classical-quantum channels, which describes the optimal exponent of the decay of decoding error when the communication rate is below the capacity. As the main result, we prove a lower bound, in terms of the quantum Renyi information in Petz's form, for the reliability function. This resolves Holevo's conjecture proposed in 2000, a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory. It turns out that the obtained lower bound matches the upper bound derived by Dalai in 2013, when the communication rate is above a critical value. Thus, we have determined the reliability function in this high-rate case. Our approach relies on Renes' breakthrough made in 2022, which relates classical-quantum channel coding to that of privacy amplification, as well as our new characterization of the channel Renyi information.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization for Learning to Communicate over Time-Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have garnered great interest in designing communication systems owing to their capacity in tacking with channel uncertainty. To provide theoretical guarantees for learning-based communication systems, some recent works analyze generalization bounds for devised methods based on the assumption of Independently and Identically Distributed (I.I.D.) channels, a condition rarely met in practical scenarios. In this paper, we drop the I.I.D. channel assumption and study an online optimization problem of learning to communicate over time-correlated channels. To address this issue, we further focus on two specific tasks: optimizing channel decoders for time-correlated fading channels and selecting optimal codebooks for time-correlated additive noise channels. For utilizing temporal dependence of considered channels to better learn communication systems, we develop two online optimization algorithms based on the optimistic online mirror descent framework. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for proposed algorithms via deriving sub-linear regret bound on the expected error probability of learned systems. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to validate that our presented approaches can leverage the channel correlation to achieve a lower average symbol error rate compared to baseline methods, consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After the optimal parameters of additive quaternary codes of dimension $k\le 3$ have been determined there is some recent activity to settle the next case of dimension $k=3.5$. Here we complete dimension $k=3.5$ and give partial results for dimension $k=4$. We also solve the problem of the optimal parameters of additive quaternary codes of arbitrary dimension when assuming a sufficiently large minimum distance.</description>

      <title>On the Training Convergence of Transformers for In-Context Classification of Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While transformers have demonstrated impressive capacities for in-context learning (ICL) in practice, theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanism enabling transformers to perform ICL is still in its infant stage. This work aims to theoretically study the training dynamics of transformers for in-context classification tasks. We demonstrate that, for in-context classification of Gaussian mixtures under certain assumptions, a single-layer transformer trained via gradient descent converges to a globally optimal model at a linear rate. We further quantify the impact of the training and testing prompt lengths on the ICL inference error of the trained transformer. We show that when the lengths of training and testing prompts are sufficiently large, the prediction of the trained transformer approaches the ground truth distribution of the labels. Experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to the linear filtering and smoothing problem and demonstrate its applicability to nonlinear filtering. For the linear case, our main theorem provides an explicit expression for the conditional distribution of the hidden process given the observations, leading to a novel derivation of the linear filtering and smoothing equations. Moreover, the theorem offers an efficient framework for computing the asymptotic expansion of nonlinear filtering.</description>

      <title>Convex Split Lemma without Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a refinement to the convex split lemma by replacing the max mutual information with the collision mutual information, transforming the inequality into an equality. This refinement yields tighter achievability bounds for quantum source coding tasks, including state merging and state splitting. Furthermore, we derive a universal upper bound on the smoothed max mutual information, where "universal" signifies that the bound depends exclusively on R\'enyi entropies and is independent of the system's dimensions. This result has significant implications for quantum information processing, particularly in applications such as the reverse quantum Shannon theorem.</description>
