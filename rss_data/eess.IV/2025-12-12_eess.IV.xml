      <title>Active Optics for Hyperspectral Imaging of Reflective Agricultural Leaf Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring plant health increasingly relies on leaf-mounted sensors that provide real-time physiological data, yet efficiently locating and sampling these sensors in complex agricultural environments remains a major challenge. We present an integrated, adaptive, and scalable system that autonomously detects and interrogates plant sensors using a coordinated suite of low-cost optical components including a LiDAR, liquid lens, monochrome camera, filter wheel, and Fast Steering Mirror (FSM). The system first uses LiDAR to identify the distinct reflective signatures of sensors within the field, then dynamically redirects the camera s field of view via the FSM to target each sensor for hyperspectral imaging. The liquid lens continuously adjusts focus to maintain image sharpness across varying depths, enabling precise spectral measurements. We validated the system in controlled indoor experiments, demonstrating accurate detection and tracking of reflective plant sensors and successful acquisition of their spectral data. To our knowledge, no other system currently integrates these sensing and optical modalities for agricultural monitoring. This work establishes a foundation for adaptive, low-cost, and automated plant sensor interrogation, representing a significant step toward scalable, real-time plant health monitoring in precision agriculture.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Image Data Reduction for Endmember Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endmember extraction from hyperspectral images aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials present in a scene. Recent studies have shown that self-dictionary methods can achieve high extraction accuracy; however, their high computational cost limits their applicability to large-scale hyperspectral images. Although several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue, it remains a major challenge. Motivated by this situation, this paper pursues a data reduction approach. Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers. Building on this result, we propose a data-reduced self-dictionary method that integrates the data reduction with a self-dictionary method based on a linear programming formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the computational time of the original self-dictionary method without sacrificing endmember extraction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust LRSD-based SAR/ISAR Imaging and Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The earlier works in the context of low-rank-sparse-decomposition (LRSD)-driven stationary synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging have shown significant improvement in the reconstruction-decomposition process. Neither of the proposed frameworks, however, can achieve satisfactory performance when facing a platform residual phase error (PRPE) arising from the instability of airborne platforms. More importantly, in spite of the significance of real-time processing requirements in remote sensing applications, these prior works have only focused on enhancing the quality of the formed image, not reducing the computational burden. To address these two concerns, this article presents a fast and unified joint SAR imaging framework where the dominant sparse objects and low-rank features of the image background are decomposed and enhanced through a robust LRSD. In particular, our unified algorithm circumvents the tedious task of computing the inverse of large matrices for image formation and takes advantage of the recent advances in constrained quadratic programming to handle the unimodular constraint imposed due to the PRPE. Furthermore, we extend our approach to ISAR autofocusing and imaging. Specifically, due to the intrinsic sparsity of ISAR images, the LRSD framework is essentially tasked with the recovery of a sparse image. Several experiments based on synthetic and real data are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of imaging quality and computational cost compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Echo-CoPilot: A Multi-View, Multi-Task Agent for Echocardiography Interpretation and Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly influenced the field of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) analysis, particularly in image-based diagnostics. Our paper presents an extensive review of AI applications in image-based CVD analysis, offering insights into its current state and future potential. We systematically categorize the literature based on the primary anatomical structures related to CVD, dividing them into non-vessel structures (such as ventricles and atria) and vessel structures (including the aorta and coronary arteries). This categorization provides a structured approach to explore various imaging modalities like Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which are commonly used in CVD research. Our review encompasses these modalities, giving a broad perspective on the diverse imaging techniques integrated with AI for CVD analysis. We conclude with an examination of the challenges and limitations inherent in current AI-based CVD analysis methods and suggest directions for future research to overcome these hurdles.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Test-Time Training with Operator Sketching for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05771v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We apply our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework, which can be efficiently applied for test-time network adaptation. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach to accelerate both EI and Sketched-EI via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT and multicoil magnetic resonance image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant computational acceleration over the standard EI counterpart, especially in test-time training tasks.</description>

      <title>Effective Online Exam Proctoring by Combining Lightweight Face Detection and Deep Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online exams, conducted via video conferencing platforms such as Zoom, have become popular in educational institutions since COVID-19. While convenient, ensuring the integrity and security of online exams remains challenging, as traditional invigilation struggles to effectively monitor multiple student video feeds in real time. In this paper, we present iExam, an effective online exam proctoring and analysis system that combines lightweight face detection and deep recognition. iExam employs real-time face detection to assist invigilators in continuously monitoring student presence, and leverages deep face recognition for post-exam video analysis to identify abnormal behaviors--including face disappearance, face rotation, and identity substitution. To realize this system, we address three core challenges: (i) designing a lightweight approach to efficiently capture and analyze exam video streams in real time; (ii) developing an enhanced OCR method to automatically extract student identities from dynamically positioned Zoom name tags, enabling reliable ground truth labeling without manual intervention; and (iii) optimizing the training and inference pipeline to significantlyreduce resource and time requirements on ordinary teacher devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that iExam achieves 90.4% accuracy for real-time face detection and 98.4% accuracy for post-exam face recognition, while maintaining low overhead. These results show that iExam can substantially enhance the automation and reliability of online exam proctoring in practice.</description>

      <title>Panoramic Out-of-Distribution Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Panoramic imaging enables capturing 360{\deg} images with an ultra-wide Field-of-View (FoV) for dense omnidirectional perception, which is critical to applications, such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, etc. However, current panoramic semantic segmentation methods fail to identify outliers, and pinhole Out-of-distribution Segmentation (OoS) models perform unsatisfactorily in the panoramic domain due to pixel distortions and background clutter. To address these issues, we introduce a new task, Panoramic Out-of-distribution Segmentation (PanOoS), with the aim of achieving comprehensive and safe scene understanding. Furthermore, we propose the first solution, POS, which adapts to the characteristics of panoramic images through text-guided prompt distribution learning. Specifically, POS integrates a disentanglement strategy designed to materialize the cross-domain generalization capability of CLIP. The proposed Prompt-based Restoration Attention (PRA) optimizes semantic decoding by prompt guidance and self-adaptive correction, while Bilevel Prompt Distribution Learning (BPDL) refines the manifold of per-pixel mask embeddings via semantic prototype supervision. Besides, to compensate for the scarcity of PanOoS datasets, we establish two benchmarks: DenseOoS, which features diverse outliers in complex environments, and QuadOoS, captured by a quadruped robot with a panoramic annular lens system. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of POS, with AuPRC improving by 34.25% and FPR95 decreasing by 21.42% on DenseOoS, outperforming state-of-the-art pinhole-OoS methods. Moreover, POS achieves leading closed-set segmentation capabilities and advances the development of panoramic understanding. Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/MengfeiD/PanOoS.</description>
