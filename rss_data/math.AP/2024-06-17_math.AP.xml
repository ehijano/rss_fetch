      <title>Classification of solutions to a biharmonic equation on the half-space and ball with pairs of conformal boundary operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a biharmonic Poisson kernel associated with certain pair of conformal boundary operators and present its explicit formula. With this powerful tool, we next establish the classification theorems of nonnegative solutions to a biharmonic equation on the upper half-space and unit ball with proper pairs of conformal boundary operators.</description>

      <title>Ancient solutions to the Allen Cahn equation in catenoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N\geq 2$ and $F:\mathbb{R}^N\to \mathbb{R} $ be the unique increasing radially symmetric function satisfying the minimal surface equation for graphs with the initial conditions $F(1)=0$ and $\lim_{r\to 1}F_r(r)=\infty;$ $r=|x|.$ We construct an ancient solution to Allen-Cahn equation $\tilde u_t = \Delta_{M} \tilde u + (1-{\tilde u}^2)\tilde u$ in $M\times(-\infty,0),$ where $M=\{(x, \pm F(|x|)):\;x\in\mathbb{R}^N,\;|x|\geq1\}$ is a $N$-dimensional catenoid in $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ and $\Delta_{M}$ is the Laplace Beltrami operator of $M.$ In particular, we construct a solution of the form $u(t,r,F(r))=u(t,r,-F(r))$ such that
  $$ u(t,r,F(r)) \approx \sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{j-1}w(r-\rho_j(t)) - \frac 12 (1+ (-1)^{k}) \quad \hbox{ as } t\to -\infty, $$ where $w(s)$ is a solution of $w'' + (1-w^2)w=0$ with $w(\pm \infty)= \pm 1,$ given by $w(s) = \tanh \left(\frac s{\sqrt{2}} \right),$ and $$\rho_j(t)=\sqrt{-2(n-1)t}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(j-\frac{k+1}{2}\right)\log\left(\frac {|t|}{\log |t| }\right)+ O(1),\quad j=1,\ldots ,k.$$</description>

      <title>Decay of solutions of non-homogenous hyperbolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider conditions for the decay in time of solutions of non-homogenous hyperbolic equations. It is proven that solutions of the equations go to $0$ in $L^2$ at infinity if and only if an equation's right-hand side uniquely determines the initial conditions in a certain way. We also obtain that a hyperbolic equation has a unique solution that fades when $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions of higher-dimensional coupled system of nonlinear time-fractional diffusion-convection-wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops how to generalize the invariant subspace method for deriving the analytical solutions of the multi-component (N+1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear time-fractional PDEs (NTFPDEs) in the sense of Caputo fractional-order derivative for the first time. Specifically, we describe how to systematically find different invariant product linear spaces with various dimensions for the considered system. Also, we observe that the obtained invariant product linear spaces help to reduce the multi-component (N+1)-dimensional coupled NTFPDEs into a system of fractional-order ODEs, which can then be solved using the well-known analytical methods. More precisely, we illustrate the effectiveness and importance of this developed method for obtaining a long list of invariant product linear spaces for the multi-component (2+1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear time-fractional diffusion-convection-wave equations. In addition, we have shown how to find different kinds of generalized separable analytical solutions for a multi-component (2 + 1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear time-fractional diffusion-convection-wave equations along with the initial and boundary conditions using invariant product linear spaces obtained. Finally, we provide appropriate graphical representations of some of the derived generalized separable analytical solutions with various fractional-order values.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the well posedness in weighted Sobolev spaces of certain linear and nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems posed on convex domains and under singular forcing. It is assumed that the weights belong to the Muckenhoupt class $A_p$ with $p \in (1,\infty$). We also propose and analyze a convergent finite element discretization for the nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems mentioned above. As an instrumental result, we prove that the discretization of certain linear problems are well posed in weighted spaces.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates and large population limits for some nonsymmetric Nash systems with semimonotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of regularity of solutions $u^i(t, x^1, \ldots, x^N)$ to a family of semilinear parabolic systems of $N$ equations, which describe closed-loop equilibria of some $N$-player differential games with quadratic Lagrangian in the velocity, running costs $f^i(x)$ and final costs $g^i(x)$. By global (semi)monotonicity assumptions on the data $f,g$, and assuming that derivatives of $f^i, g^i$ in directions $x_j$ are of order $1/N$ for $j \neq i$, we prove that derivatives of $u^i$ enjoy the same property. The estimates are uniform in the number of players $N$. Such behaviour of the derivatives of $f^i, g^i$ arise in the theory of Mean Field Games, though here we do not make any symmetry assumption on the data.
  Then, by the estimates obtained we address the convergence problem $N \to \infty$ in a ``heterogeneous'' Mean Field framework, where players all observe the empirical measure of the whole population, but may react differently from one another.</description>

      <title>On the refined analyticity radius of 3-D generalized Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the instantaneous growth of analyticity radius for three dimensional generalized Navier-Stokes equations. For the subcritical $H^{\gamma}(\mathbb R^3)$ case with $\gamma&gt;\frac12,$ we prove that there exists a positive time $t_0$ so that for any $t\in]0, t_0]$, the radius of analyticity of the solution $u$ satisfies the pointwise-in-time lower bound $${\mathrm{rad}}(u)(t)\ge \sqrt{(2\gamma-1)t\bigl(|\ln t|+\ln|\ln t|+K_t\bigr)},$$ where $K_t \to \infty$ as $t\to 0^+$. This in particular gives a nontrivial improvement of the previous result by Herbst and Skibsted in \cite{HS} for the case $\gamma\in ]1/2,3/2[$ and also settles the decade-long open question in \cite{HS}, namely, whether or not
  $\liminf_{t\to 0^+}\frac {{\mathrm{ rad}}(u)(t)}{\sqrt{t|\ln t|}}\ge \sqrt{2\gamma-1}$ for all $\gamma\ge \frac32$. For the critical case $H^{\frac 12}(\mathbb R^3)$, we prove that there exists $t_1&gt;0$ so that for any $t\in ]0, t_1],$ ${\mathrm {rad}}(u)(t)\ge \lambda(t)\sqrt{t}$ with $\lambda(t)$ satisfying $\lim_{t\to 0^+}\lambda(t)=\infty.$</description>

      <title>Nested discontinuous asymptotic profiles for the viscous Burgers equation with infinite mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the viscous Burgers equation with a family of initial data having infinite mass. After rescaling, the solution converges toward a bounded discontinuous profile in the long-time limit. Moreover, by changing the scale near the discontinuity point again, we find a new profile that is also discontinuous. This process can be repeated an arbitrary number of times.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a continuation of research started in [7] devoted to explicit asymptotic formulas for standing coastal-trapped waves. Our main goal is to construct formal asymptotic eigenfunctions of the wave operator $\langle \nabla, D(x)\nabla\rangle$ (the spatial part of the wave operator) corresponding to the eigenvalue $\omega\to\infty$ in a nearly integrable case.</description>

      <title>Exponential localization of 2d Magnetic Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions via Brownian flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions of $\tfrac12 (-i\nabla - A(x))^2f=\lambda f$ on domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions and prove exponential decay estimates in terms of an Agmon type distance to a classically allowed region. This metric depends only on the eigenvalue and associated magnetic field. In fact the main quantity in the weight for this distance function can be interpreted as an `average magnetic flux' of the magnetic field along all domains whose boundary is the closed curved formed by joing the `minimal path' to another random path. Our estimates are based on an analysis of the associated heat kernel using the Feynman-Kac-It\'o formula.</description>

      <title>The stability of sheath to the nonisentropic Euler-Poisson system with fluid-boundary interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we define the sheath by a monotone stationary solution to the nonisentropic Euler-Poisson system under a condition known as the Bohm criterion and consider a situation in which charged particles accumulate on the boundary due to the flux from the inner region. Under this fluid-boundary interactive setting, we prove the large time asymptotic stability of the sheath provided that the initial perturbation is sufficiently small in some weighted Sobolev spaces. Moreover, the convergence rate of the solution toward the sheath is obtained. The proof is based on the weighted energy method.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior toward composite wave of shocks for 3D barotropic navier-stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the barotropic Navier-Stokes system in three space dimensions with periodic boundary condition in the transversal direction. We show the long-time behavior of the 3D barotropic Navier-Stokes flow perturbed from a composition of two shock waves with suitably small amplitudes. We prove that the perturbed Navier-Stokes flow converges, uniformly in space, towards a composition of two planar viscous shock waves as time goes to infinity, up to dynamical shifts. This is the first result on time-asymptotic stability of composite wave of two shocks for multi-D Navier-Stokes system. The main part of proof is based on the method of a-contraction with shifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for quasistatic growth of cavities and cracks in two-dimensional nonlinear elasticity. Cavities and cracks are modeled as discrete and compact subsets of a planar domain, respectively, and deformations are defined only outside of cracks. The model accounts for the irreversibility of both processes of cavitation and fracture and it allows for the coalescence of cavities into cracks. Our main result shows the existence of quasistatic evolutions in the case of a finite number of cavities, under an a priori bound on the number of connected components of the cracks.</description>

      <title>New characterization of weighted inequalities involving superposition of Hardy integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1\leq p &lt;\infty$ and $0 &lt; q,r &lt; \infty$. We characterize the validity of the inequality for the composition of the Hardy operator, \begin{equation*} \bigg(\int_a^b \bigg(\int_a^x \bigg(\int_a^t f(s)ds \bigg)^q u(t) dt \bigg)^{\frac{r}{q}} w(x) dx \bigg)^{\frac{1}{r}} \leq C \bigg(\int_a^b f(x)^p v(x) dx \bigg)^{\frac{1}{p}} \end{equation*} for all non-negative measurable functions $f$ on $(a,b)$, $-\infty \leq a &lt; b \leq \infty$. We construct a more straightforward discretization method than those previously presented in the literature, and we provide some new scales of weight characterizations of this inequality in both discrete and continuous forms and we obtain previous characterizations as the special case of the parameter.</description>

      <title>On the stability of Type I self-similar blowups for the Keller-Segel system in three dimensions and higher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system in spatial dimensions $d\geq3$, which corresponds to the mass supercritical case. Some solutions become singular in finite time, an important example being backward self-similar solutions. Herrero et al. and Brenner et al. showed the existence of such profiles, countably many in dimensions $3\leq d \leq 9$ and at least two for $d\geq 10$. We establish that all these self-similar profiles are stable along a set of initial data with finite Lipschitz codimension equal to the number of instable eigenmodes. This extends the recent finding of Glogi\'c et al. showing the stability of the fundamental self-similar profile. We obtain additional results, such as the possibility of the solutions we construct to originate from smooth and compactly supported initial data, their convergence at blow-up time, and the Lipschitz regularity of the blow-up time. Our proof extends the approach proposed in Collot et al., based on renormalizing the solution around a modulated self-similar solution, and using a spectral gap for the linearized operator in the parabolic neighbourhood of the singularity.</description>

      <title>Shape perturbation of a nonlinear mixed problem for the heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the heat equation in a domain that has a hole in its interior. We impose a Neumann condition on the exterior boundary and a nonlinear Robin condition on the boundary of the hole. The shape of the hole is determined by a suitable diffeomorphism $\phi$ defined on the boundary of a reference domain. Assuming that the problem has a solution $u_0$ when $\phi$ is the identity map, we demonstrate that a solution $u_\phi$ continues to exist for $\phi$ close to the identity map and that the "domain-to-solution" map $\phi\mapsto u_\phi$ is of class $C^\infty$. Moreover, we show that the family of solutions $\{u_\phi\}_{\phi}$ is, in a sense, locally unique. Our argument relies on tools from Potential Theory and the Implicit Function Theorem. Some remarks on the linear case complete the paper.</description>

      <title>On existence of Sadovskii vortex patch: A touching pair of symmetric counter-rotating uniform vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sadovskii vortex patch is a traveling wave for the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations consisting of an odd symmetric pair of vortex patches touching the symmetry axis. Its existence was first suggested by numerical computations of Sadovskii in [J. Appl. Math. Mech., 1971], and has gained significant interest due to its relevance in inviscid limit of planar flows via Prandtl--Batchelor theory and as the asymptotic state for vortex ring dynamics. In this work, we prove the existence of a Sadovskii vortex patch, by solving the energy maximization problem under the exact impulse condition and an upper bound on the circulation.</description>

      <title>The Incompressible Limit of the Equations of Compressible Ideal Magneto-Hydrodynamics with perfectly conducting boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial-boundary value problem in the halfspace for the system of equations of ideal Magneto-Hydrodynamics with a perfectly conducting wall boundary condition. We show the convergence of solutions to the solution of the equations of incompressible MHD as the Mach number goes to zero. Because of the characteristic boundary, where a loss of regularity in the normal direction to the boundary may occur, the convergence is shown in suitable anisotropic Sobolev spaces which take account of the singular behavior at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Liouville-type theorems for fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations with boundary degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a general class of fully nonlinear boundary-degenerate elliptic equations that admit a trivial solution. Although no boundary conditions are posed together with the equations, we show that the operator degeneracy actually generates an implicit boundary condition. Under appropriate assumptions on the degeneracy rate and regularity of the operator, we then prove that there exist no bounded solutions other than the trivial one. Our method is based on the arguments for uniqueness of viscosity solutions to state constraint problems for Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We obtain similar results for fully nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations. Several concrete examples of the equations that satisfy the assumptions are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions in self-similar form presenting finite time extinction to the singular diffusion equation with gradient absorption $$\partial_t u - \mathrm{div}(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u) +|\nabla u|^{q}=0 \qquad {\rm in} \ (0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N$$ are studied when $N\geq1$ and the exponents $(p,q)$ satisfy $p_c=\frac{2N}{N+1}$, $p-1&lt;q&lt;\frac{p}{2}$. Existence and uniqueness of such a solution are established in dimension $N=1$. In dimension $N\geq2$, existence  of radially symmetric self-similar solutions is proved and a fine description of their behavior as $|x|\to\infty$ is provided.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness theory and the scattering asymptotics for the energy-critical, Schr\"odinger equation with general nonlinearity \begin{equation*}

Using contraction mapping method and concentration compactness argument, we obtain the well-posedness theory in proper function spaces and scattering asymptotics.

      <description>arXiv:2406.11542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper,we consider the solutions of the elliptic double obstacle problems with Orlicz growth involving measure data. Some pointwise estimates for the approximable solutions to these problems are obtained in terms of fractional maximal operators. Furthermore, we establish pointwise and oscillation estimates for the gradients of solutions via the non-linear Wolff potentials, which in turn yield $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the well-posedness of the differential equation $Au=f$ in the setting of a stratified group $\mathbb{G}$ when the considered second-order differential operator $A$ can be non-invariant and non-linear. Our approach follows the Campanato theory of nearness of operators, allowing one to treat equations with only bounded coefficients, without any regularity assumptions. Our analysis becomes explicit in the particular case of the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ of any dimension and on the Euclidean case $\mathbb{R}^n$, where in the latter case our results also extend the known results by treating the unbounded domain setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that, given a planar Reifenberg flat domain with small constant and a divergence form operator associated to a real (not necessarily symmetric) uniformly elliptic matrix with Lipschitz coefficients, the Hausdorff dimension of its elliptic measure is at most 1. More precisely, we prove that there exists a subset of the boundary with full elliptic measure and with $\sigma$-finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measure. For Reifenberg flat domains, this result extends a previous work of Thomas H. Wolff for the harmonic measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to investigate the emergence of periodic oscillations of rimming flows, we study analytically the stability of steady states for the model of (Benilov, Kopteva, O'Brien, 2005), which describes the dynamics of a thin fluid film coating the inner wall of a rotating cylinder and includes effects of surface tension, gravity, and hydrostatic pressure. We apply multi-parameter perturbation methods to eigenvalues of Fr\'echet derivatives and prove the transition of a pair of conjugate eigenvalues from the stable to the unstable complex half-plane under appropriate variations of parameters. In order to prove rigorously the corresponding branching of periodic solutions from critical equilibria, we extend the multi-parameter Hopf-bifurcation theory to the case of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the Fourier extension operator associated to the fractional surface $(\xi,|\xi|^{\alpha})$ with $\alpha\geq 2$. We show that nearly all valid scale-invariant Fourier extension inequalities possess extremals. More precisely, if the Fourier extension operator is bounded for an endpoint $p_0$, then for all $1&lt;p&lt; p_0$, the corresponding $L^p$-extremal sequences are precompact up to symmetries. In particular, we have developed the relevant $L^p$-profile decomposition for these Fourier extension operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is mainly concerned with the large deviation principle of the fractional McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equation defined on R^n with polynomial drift of any degree. We first prove the well-posedness of the underlying equation under a dissipative condition, and then show the strong convergence of solutions of the corresponding controlled equation with respect to the weak topology of controls, by employing the idea of uniform tail-ends estimates of solutions in order to circumvent the non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings on unbounded domains. We finally establish the large deviation principle of the fractional McKean-Vlasov equation by the weak convergence method without assuming the time Holder continuity of the non-autonomous diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation of Schr\"odinger-type equations for $\bar\partial$ II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our earlier unique continuation results \cite{PZ2} for the Schr\"odinger-type inequality $ |\bar\partial u| \le V|u|$ on a domain in $\mathbb C^n$ by removing the smoothness assumption on solutions $u = (u_1, \ldots, u_N)$. More specifically, we establish the unique continuation property for $W_{loc}^{1,1}$ solutions when the potential $V\in L_{loc}^p $, $ p&gt;2n$; and for $W_{loc}^{1,2n+\epsilon}$ solutions when $V\in L_{loc}^{2n}$ with $N=1$ or $n = 2$. Although the unique continuation property fails in general if $V\in L_{loc}^{p}, p&lt;2n$, we show that the property still holds for $W_{loc}^{1,1}$ solutions when $V $ is a small constant multiple of $ \frac{1}{|z|}$.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference least square methods for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple algorithm to approximate the viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi~(HJ) equations by means of an artificial deep neural network. The algorithm uses a stochastic gradient descent-based algorithm to minimize the least square principle defined by a monotone, consistent numerical scheme. We analyze the least square principle's critical points and derive conditions that guarantee that any critical point approximates the sought viscosity solution. The use of a deep artificial neural network on a finite difference scheme lifts the restriction of conventional finite difference methods that rely on computing functions on a fixed grid. This feature makes it possible to solve HJ equations posed in higher dimensions where conventional methods are infeasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical studies on various canonical HJ equations across different dimensions, showcasing its potential and versatility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of input-to-state stabilization for a class of parabolic equations with time-varying coefficients, as well as Dirichlet and Robin boundary disturbances. By using time-invariant kernel functions, which can reduce the complexity in control design and implementation, an observer-based output feedback controller is designed via backstepping. By using the generalized Lyapunov method, which can be used to handle Dirichlet boundary terms, the input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system under output feedback control, as well as the state estimation error system, is established in the spatial $L^\infty$-norm. Numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the theoretical results and to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description>

Abstract: This paper first investigates solvability of Hermitian-Einstein equation on a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle on the complement of an arbitrary closed subset in a compact complex manifold. The uniqueness of Hermitian-Einstein metrics on a Zariski open subset in a compact K\"{a}hler manifold was only figured out by Takuro Mochizuki recently, the second part of this paper gives an affirmative answer to a question proposed by Takuro Mochizuki and based on which it leads to an alternative approach to the unique issue. We also prove stability from solvability of Hermitian-Einstein equation, which together with the classical existence result of Carlos Simpson in particular establish a Kobayashi-Hitchin bijective correspondence. The argument is also effective for uniqueness result and Kobayashi-Hitchin bijective correspondence on $\mathbb{C}$, as well as on non-K\"{a}hler and semi-stable contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.02345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of nonnegative solutions to the following nonlocal elliptic problem involving singularity
  \begin{align}
  \mathfrak{M}\left(\int_{Q}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{N+ps}}dxdy\right)(-\Delta)_{p}^{s} u&amp;=\frac{\lambda}{|u|^{\gamma-1}u}+|u|^{p_s^*-2}u~\text{in}~\Omega,\nonumber
  u&amp;&gt;0~\text{in}~\Omega,\nonumber
  u&amp;=0~\text{in}~\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega,\nonumber
  \end{align} 
  where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary, $\lambda&gt;0$, $N&gt;ps$, $0&lt;s,\gamma&lt;1$, $(-\Delta)_{p}^{s}$ is the fractional $p$-Laplacian operator for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $p_s^*=\frac{Np}{N-ps}$ is the critical Sobolev exponent. We employ a {\it cut-off} argument to obtain the existence of $k$ (being an arbitrarily large integer) solutions. Furthermore, by using the Moser iteration technique, we prove a uniform $L^{\infty}({\Omega})$ bound for the solutions. The novelty of this work lies in proving the existence of small energy solutions by using the symmetric mountain pass theorem in spite of the presence of a critical nonlinear term which, of course, is super-linear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness of a class of evolutionary variational-hemivariational inequalities coupled with a nonlinear ordinary differential equation in Banach spaces. The proof is based on an iterative approximation scheme showing that the problem has a unique mild solution. In addition, we established the continuity of the flow map with respect to the initial data. Under the general framework, we consider two new applications for modelling of frictional contact for viscoelastic materials. In the first application, we consider Coulomb friction with normal compliance, and in the second, normal damped response. The structure of the friction coefficient $\mu$ is new with motivation from geophysical applications in earth sciences with dependence on an external state variable $\alpha$ and the slip rate $|\dot{u}_\tau|$.</description>

Abstract: We present a variational treatment of confined magnetic skyrmions in a minimal micromagnetic model of ultrathin ferromagnetic films with interfacial Dzylashinksii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in competition with the exchange energy, with a possible addition of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Under Dirichlet boundary conditions that are motivated by the asymptotic treatment of the stray field energy in the thin film limit we prove existence of topologically non-trivial energy minimizers that concentrate on points in the domain as the DMI strength parameter tends to zero. Furthermore, we derive the leading order non-trivial term in the $\Gamma$-expansion of the energy in the limit of vanishing DMI strength that allows us to completely characterize the limiting magnetization profiles and interpret them as particle-like states whose radius and position are determined by minimizing a renormalized energy functional. In particular, we show that in our setting the skyrmions are strongly repelled from the domain boundaries, which imparts them with stability that is highly desirable for applications. We provide explicit calculations of the renormalized energy for a number of basic domain geometries.</description>

      <title>A variational model of charged drops in dielectrically matched binary fluids: the effect of charge discreteness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the ill-posedness of the classical Rayleigh variational model of conducting charged liquid drops by incorporating the discreteness of the elementary charges. Introducing the model that describes two immiscible fluids with the same dielectric constant, with a drop of one fluid containing a fixed number of elementary charges together with their solvation spheres, we interpret the equilibrium shape of the drop as a global minimizer of the sum of its surface energy and the electrostatic repulsive energy between the charges under fixed drop volume. For all model parameters, we establish existence of generalized minimizers that consist of at most a finite number of components ``at infinity''. We also give several existence and non-existence results for classical minimizers consisting of only a single component. In particular, we identify an asymptotically sharp threshold for the number of charges to yield existence of minimizers in a regime corresponding to macroscopically large drops containing a large number of charges. The obtained non-trivial threshold is significantly below the corresponding threshold for the Rayleigh model, consistently with the ill-posedness of the latter and demonstrating a particular regularizing effect of the charge discreteness. However, when a minimizer does exist in this regime, it approaches a ball with the charge uniformly distributed on the surface as the number of charges goes to infinity, just as in the Rayleigh model. Finally, we provide an explicit solution for the problem with two charges and a macroscopically large drop.</description>

      <title>Stable nearly self-similar blowup of the 2D Boussinesq and 3D Euler equations with smooth data II: Rigorous Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is Part II of our paper in which we prove finite time blowup of the 2D Boussinesq and 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with smooth initial data of finite energy and boundary. In Part I of our paper [ChenHou2023a], we establish an analytic framework to prove stability of an approximate self-similar blowup profile by a combination of a weighted $L^\infty$ norm and a weighted $C^{1/2}$ norm. Under the assumption that the stability constants, which depend on the approximate steady state, satisfy certain inequalities stated in our stability lemma, we prove stable nearly self-similar blowup of the 2D Boussinesq and 3D Euler equations with smooth initial data and boundary. In Part II of our paper, we provide sharp stability estimates of the linearized operator by constructing space-time solutions with rigorous error control. We also obtain sharp estimates of the velocity in the regular case using computer assistance. These results enable us to verify that the stability constants obtained in Part I [ChenHou2023a] indeed satisfy the inequalities in our stability lemma. This completes the analysis of the finite time singularity of the axisymmetric Euler equations with smooth initial data and boundary.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a variational treatment of the effect of external charges on the free charges in an infinite free-standing graphene sheet within the Thomas-Fermi theory. We establish existence, uniqueness and regularity of the energy minimizers corresponding to the free charge densities that screen the effect of an external electrostatic potential at the neutrality point. For the potential due to one or several off-layer point charges, we also prove positivity and a precise universal asymptotic decay rate for the screening charge density, as well as an exact charge cancellation by the graphene sheet. We also treat a simpler case of the non-zero background charge density and establish similar results in that case.</description>

      <title>Reduced energies for thin ferromagnetic films with perpendicular anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive four reduced two-dimensional models that describe, at different spatial scales, the micromagnetics of ultrathin ferromagnetic materials of finite spatial extent featuring perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Starting with a microscopic model that regularizes the stray field near the material's lateral edges, we carry out an asymptotic analysis of the energy by means of $\Gamma$-convergence. Depending on the scaling assumptions on the size of the material domain vs. the strength of dipolar interaction, we obtain a hierarchy of the limit energies that exhibit progressively stronger stray field effects of the material edges. These limit energies feature, respectively, a renormalization of the out-of-plane anisotropy, an additional local boundary penalty term forcing out-of-plane alignment of the magnetization at the edge, a pinned magnetization at the edge, and, finally, a pinned magnetization and an additional field-like term that blows up at the edge, as the sample's lateral size is increased. The pinning of the magnetization at the edge restores the topological protection and enables the existence of magnetic skyrmions in bounded samples.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem of the Euler-Poincar\'e equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a varying dispersion parameter $\alpha$. Based on the convex entropy structure and the modified commutator estimates, we have proved that the Euler-Poincar\'e equations have a uniform existence time with respect to $\alpha$ in Sobolev spaces $H^s.$ Combined with the Bona-Simth method, we obtain convergence of the solutions to the Euler-Poincar\'e equations as $\alpha\to 0$ in the same space where the initial data are located.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness, magnetic helicity conservation, inviscid limit and asymptotic stability for the generalized Navier-Stokes-Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the well-posedness, conservation of magnetic helicity, inviscid limit and asymptotic stability of the generalized Navier-Stokes-Maxwell (NSM) equations with the standard Ohm's law in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \in \{2,3\}$. More precisely, the global well-posedness is established in case of fractional Laplacian velocity $(-\Delta)^\alpha v$ with $\alpha = \frac{d}{2}$ for suitable data. In addition, the local well-posedness in the inviscid case is also provided for sufficient smooth data, which allows us to study the inviscid limit of associated positive viscosity solutions in the case $\alpha = 1$, where an explicit bound on the difference is given. Furthermore, in three dimensions if the initial data satisfies futher suitable conditions then magnetic helicity is conserved as the electric conductivity goes to infinity. On the other hand, in the case $\alpha = 0$ the stability near a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with a constant (or equivalently bounded) magnetic field is also obtained in which nonhomogeneous Sobolev norms of the velocity and electric fields, and for $p \in (2,\infty]$ the $L^p$ norm of the magnetic field converge to zero as time goes to infinity with an implicit rate. In this velocity damping case, the situation is different both in case of the two and a half, and three-dimensional (Hall)-magnetohydrodynamics ((H)-MHD) system, where an explicit rate of convergence in infinite time is computed for both the velocity and magnetic fields in nonhomogeneous Sobolev norms. Therefore, it seems that there is a gap between NSM and MHD in terms of the norm convergence of the magnetic field and the rate of decaying in time, even the latter equations can be proved as a limiting system of the former one in the sense of distributions as the speed of light tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Weak solvability of elliptic variational inequalities coupled with a nonlinear differential equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish existence, uniqueness, and boundedness results for an elliptic variational inequality coupled with a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. Under the general framework, we present a new application modelling the antiplane shear deformation of a static frictional adhesive contact problem. The adhesion process has been extensively studied, but it is usual to assume a priori that the intensity of adhesion is bounded by introducing truncation operators. The aim of this article is to remove this restriction.
  The proof is based on an iterative approximation scheme showing that the problem has a unique solution. A key ingredient is finding uniform a priori bounds for each iterate. These are obtained by adapting versions of the Moser iteration to our system of equations.</description>

      <title>On the Incompressible Limit of Current-Vortex Sheets with or without Surface Tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second part of the two-paper sequence, which aims to present a comprehensive study for current-vortex sheets with or without surface tension in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The results of this paper are two-fold: First, we establish the zero-surface-tension limit of compressible current-vortex sheets under certain stability conditions on the free interface; Second, when the two-phase flows are isentropic and the density functions converge to the same constant as Mach number goes to zero, we can drop the boundedness assumption (with respect to Mach number) on high-order time derivatives by combining the paradifferential approach applied to the evolution equation of the free interface, the structure of wave equations for the total pressure and the anisotropic Sobolev spaces with suitable weights of Mach number. To our knowledge, this is the first result that rigorously justifies the incompressible limit of free-surface MHD flows. Moreover, we actually present a robust framework for the low Mach number limit of vortex-sheet problems, which was never established in any previous works.</description>

      <title>Normal traces and applications to continuity equations on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study several properties of the normal Lebesgue trace of vector fields introduced by the second and third author in [18] in the context of the energy conservation for the Euler equations in Onsager-critical classes. Among several properties, we prove that the normal Lebesgue trace satisfies the Gauss-Green identity and, by providing explicit counterexamples, that it is a notion sitting strictly between the distributional one for measure-divergence vector fields and the strong one for $BV$ functions. These results are then applied to the study of the uniqueness of weak solutions for continuity equations on bounded domains, allowing to remove the assumption in [15] of global $BV$ regularity up to the boundary, at least around the portion of the boundary where the characteristics exit the domain or are tangent. The proof relies on an explicit renormalization formula completely characterized by the boundary datum and the positive part of the normal Lebesgue trace. In the case when the characteristics enter the domain, a counterexample shows that achieving the normal trace in the Lebesgue sense is not enough to prevent non-uniqueness, and thus a $BV$ assumption seems to be necessary for the uniqueness of weak solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend Wigner's original framework to analyze linear operators by examining the relationship between their Wigner and Schwartz kernels. Our approach includes the introduction of (quasi-)algebras of Fourier integral operators (FIOs), which encompass FIOs of type I and II. The symbols of these operators reside in (weighted) modulation spaces, particularly in Sj\"ostrand's class, known for its favorable properties in time-frequency analysis. One of the significant results of our study is demonstrating the inverse-closedness of these symbol classes.
  Our analysis includes fundamental examples such as pseudodifferential operators and Fourier integral operators related to Schr{\"o}dinger-type equations. These examples typically feature classical Hamiltonian flows governed by linear symplectic transformations $S \in Sp(d, \mathbb{R})$. The core idea of our approach is to utilize the Wigner kernel to transform a Fourier integral operator $ T $ on $ \mathbb{R}^d $ into a pseudodifferential operator $ K$ on $ \mathbb{R}^{2d}$. This transformation involves a symbol $\sigma$ well-localized around the manifold defined by $ z = S w $.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of minimizers for classical capillarity problems in presence of nonlocal repulsion and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate, under a volume constraint and among sets contained in a Euclidean half-space, the minimization problem of an energy functional given by the sum of a capillarity perimeter, a nonlocal repulsive term and a gravitational potential energy. The capillarity perimeter assigns a constant weight to the portion of the boundary touching the boundary of the half-space. The nonlocal term is represented by a double integral of a positive kernel $g$, while the gravitational term is represented by the integral of a positive potential $G$.
  We first establish existence of volume-constrained minimizers in the small mass regime, together with several qualitative properties of minimizers. The existence result holds even for rather general choices of kernels in the nonlocal term, including attractive-repulsive ones. When the nonlocal kernel $g(x)=1/|x|^\beta$ with $\beta \in (0,2]$, we also obtain nonexistence of volume constrained minimizers in the large mass regime. Finally, we prove a generalized existence result of minimizers holding for all masses, meaning that the infimum of the problem is realized by a finite disjoint union of sets thought located at "infinite distance" one from the other.
  These results stem from an application of quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for the capillarity problem in a half-space.</description>

Abstract: We consider the long-time dynamics of focusing energy-critical Schr\"odinger equation perturbed by the $\dot{H}^\frac{1}{2}$-critical nonlinearity and with inverse-square potential(CNLS$_a$) in dimensions $d\in\{3,4,5\}$ \begin{equation}\label{NLS-ab} \begin{cases} i\partial_tu-\mathcal{L}_au=-|u|^{\frac{4}{d-2}}u+|u|^{\frac{4}{d-1}}u, \quad (t,x)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^d,\tag{CNLS$_a$},\\ u(0,x)=u_0(x)\in H^1_a(\mathbb{R}^d), \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\mathcal{L}_a=-\Delta+a|x|^{-2}$ and the energy is below and equal to the threshold $m_a$, which is given by the ground state $W_a$ satisfying $\mathcal{L}_aW_a=|W_a|^{\frac{4}{d-2}}W_a$. When the energy is below the threshold, we utilize the concentration-compactness argument as well as the variatonal analysis to characterize the scattering and blow-up region. When the energy is equal to the threshold, we use the modulation analysis associated to the equation \eqref{NLS-ab} to classify the dynamics of $H_a^1$-solution. In both regimes of scattering results, we do not need the radial assumption in $d=4,5$. Our result generalizes the scattering results of [31-33] and [3] in the setting of standard combined NLS.</description>

      <title>Lectures on mean curvature flow of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.10485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean curvature flow is the most natural evolution equation in extrinsic geometry, and shares many features with Hamilton's Ricci flow from intrinsic geometry. In this lecture series, I will provide an introduction to the mean curvature flow of surfaces, with a focus on the analysis of singularities. We will see that the surfaces evolve uniquely through neck singularities and nonuniquely through conical singularities. Studying these questions, we will also learn many general concepts and methods, such as monotonicity formulas, epsilon-regularity, weak solutions, and blowup analysis that are of great importance in the analysis of a wide range of partial differential equations. These lecture notes are from summer schools at UT Austin and CRM Montreal, and also contain a detailed discussion of open problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Existence of four minimal spheres in $S^3$ with a bumpy metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that in the three dimensional sphere with a bumpy metric or a metric with positive Ricci curvature, there exist at least four distinct embedded minimal two-spheres. This confirms a conjecture of S. T. Yau in 1982 for bumpy metrics and metrics with positive Ricci curvature. The proof relies on a multiplicity one theorem for the Simon-Smith min-max theory.</description>

      <title>A convergent stochastic scalar auxiliary variable method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an extension of the scalar auxiliary variable approach, which was originally introduced by Shen et al. ([Shen, Xu, Yang, J. Comput. Phys., 2018]) for the discretization of deterministic gradient flows. By introducing an additional scalar auxiliary variable, this approach allows to derive a linear scheme, while still maintaining unconditional stability. Our extension augments the approximation of the evolution of this scalar auxiliary variable with higher order terms, which enables its application to stochastic partial differential equations. Using the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation as a prototype for nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative noise, we propose an unconditionally energy stable, linear, fully discrete finite element scheme based on our augmented scalar auxiliary variable method. Recovering a discrete version of the energy estimate and establishing Nikolskii estimates with respect to time, we are able to prove convergence of discrete solutions towards pathwise unique martingale solutions by applying Jakubowski's generalization of Skorokhod's theorem. A generalization of the Gy\"ongy--Krylov characterization of convergence in probability to quasi-Polish spaces finally provides convergence of fully discrete solutions towards strong solutions of the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation. Finally, we present numerical simulations underlining the practicality of the scheme and the importance of the introduced augmentation terms.</description>

      <title>Gelation in cluster coagulation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of gelation in the cluster coagulation model introduced by Norris [$\textit{Comm. Math. Phys.}$, 209(2):407-435 (2000)], where pairs of clusters of types $(x,y)$ taking values in a measure space $E$, merge to form a new particle of type $z\in E$ according to a transition kernel $K(x,y, \mathrm{d} z)$.This model possesses enough generality to accommodate inhomogenieties in the evolution of clusters, including variations in their shape or spatial distribution. We derive general, sufficient criteria for stochastic gelation and strong gelation in this model. As particular cases, we extend results related to the classical Marcus--Lushnikov coagulation process, showing that reasonable `homogenous' coagulation processes with exponent $\gamma&gt;1$ yield gelation; and also, coagulation processes with kernel $\bar{K}(m,n)~\geq~(m \wedge n) \log{(m \wedge n)}^{3 +\epsilon}$ for $\epsilon&gt;0$. Finally, we use coupling arguments with inhomogeneous random graphs to deduce sufficient criterion for strong gelation (the emergence of a particle of size $O(N)$).</description>

      <title>A note on weak existence for singular SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Krylov established weak existence of solutions to SDEs for integrable drifts in mixed Lebesgue spaces, whose exponents satisfy the condition $1/q+d/p\leq 1$, thus going below the celebrated Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin condition. We present here a variant of such result, whose proof relies on an alternative technique, based on a partial Zvonkin transform; this allows for drifts with growth at infinity and/or in uniformly local Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic spreading of predator-prey populations in a shifting environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies associating shifting temperature conditions with changes in the efficiency of predator species in converting their prey to offspring, we propose a predator-prey model of reaction-diffusion type to analyze the consequence of such effects on the population dynamics and spread of species. In the model, the predator conversion efficiency is represented by a spatially heterogeneous function depending on the variable $\xi=x-c_1t$ for some given $c_1&gt;0$. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach, we provide explicit formulas for the spreading speed of the predator species. When the conversion function is monotone increasing, the spreading speed is determined in all cases and non-local pulling is possible. When the function is monotone decreasing, we provide formulas for the spreading speed when the rate of shift of the conversion function is sufficiently fast or slow.</description>

      <title>Collapse of the Gibbs measure for the dynamical $\Phi^3_2$-models on the infinite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $\Phi^3_2$-measure in the infinite volume limit. This is the invariant measure for several stochastic partial differential equations including the parabolic and hyperbolic $\Phi^3_2$-models. In the large torus limit, we observe a concentration phenomenon of the $\Phi^3_2$-measure around zero, which is the single minimizer of the corresponding Hamiltonian for any fixed torus size. From our sharp estimates for the partition function, we obtain a triviality result for the $\Phi^3_2$-measure on infinite volume: the ensemble collapses onto a delta function on the zero field.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for capillary hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we first introduce the quermassintegrals for compact hypersurfaces with capillary boundaries in hyperbolic space from a variational viewpoint, and then we solve an isoperimetric type problem in hyperbolic space. By constructing a new locally constrained inverse curvature flow, we obtain the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for convex capillary hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space. This generalizes a theorem of Brendle-Guan-Li \cite{BGL} for convex closed hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space.</description>
