      <title>Learning to Discover Regulatory Elements for Gene Expression Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting gene expressions from DNA sequences. A key challenge of this task is to find the regulatory elements that control gene expressions. Here, we introduce Seq2Exp, a Sequence to Expression network explicitly designed to discover and extract regulatory elements that drive target gene expression, enhancing the accuracy of the gene expression prediction. Our approach captures the causal relationship between epigenomic signals, DNA sequences and their associated regulatory elements. Specifically, we propose to decompose the epigenomic signals and the DNA sequence conditioned on the causal active regulatory elements, and apply an information bottleneck with the Beta distribution to combine their effects while filtering out non-causal components. Our experiments demonstrate that Seq2Exp outperforms existing baselines in gene expression prediction tasks and discovers influential regions compared to commonly used statistical methods for peak detection such as MACS3. The source code is released as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/).</description>

      <title>From Mutation to Degradation: Predicting Nonsense-Mediated Decay with NMDEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a critical post-transcriptional surveillance mechanism that degrades transcripts with premature termination codons, safeguarding transcriptome integrity and shaping disease phenotypes. However, accurately predicting NMD efficiency remains challenging, as existing models often rely on simplistic rule-based heuristics or limited feature sets, constraining their accuracy and generalizability. Using paired DNA and RNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we benchmark embedding-only models and demonstrate that they underperform compared to a simple rule-based approach. To address this, we develop NMDEP (NMD Efficiency Predictor), an integrative framework that combines optimized rule-based methods, sequence embeddings, and curated biological features, achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance. Through explainable AI, we identify key NMD determinants, reaffirming established factors such as variant position while uncovering novel contributors like ribosome loading. Applied to over 2.9 million simulated stop-gain variants, NMDEP facilitates large-scale mRNA degradation assessments, advancing variant interpretation and disease research.</description>
