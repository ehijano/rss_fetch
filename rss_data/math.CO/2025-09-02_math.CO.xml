      <title>Improvement on line transversals of families of connected sets in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three lines are concurrent if they intersect at a single point. In this paper I prove that if $F$ is a bounded family of compact connected sets in the plane, such that every three sets in $F$ can be pierced by a single line, then there exists three concurrent lines in the plane such that the union of the three lines intersect every member of $F$. This had previously only been proven for lines that are not required to be concurrent by McGinnis and Zerbib in arXiv:2103.05565v2. In fact, I prove a more general, ``colorful'' version of this result: If $F_1, \dots , F_5$ are bounded families of compact connected sets in the plane such that every three sets, chosen from three distinct families $F_i$, can be pierced by a single line, then there exists $1 \leq j \leq 5$ and three concurrent lines, such that the union of the three lines intersect every member of $F_j$. McGinnis and Zerbib had 6 families instead of 5, so I also improve their result in this respect. Moreover, the result can also be extended to unbounded families, if we allow the piercing lines to be parallel.</description>

      <title>String Graph Obstacles of High Girth and of Bounded Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A string graph is the intersection graph of curves in the plane. Kratochv\'il previously showed the existence of infinitely many obstacles: graphs that are not string graphs but for which any edge contraction or vertex deletion produces a string graph. Kratochv\'il's obstacles contain arbitrarily large cliques, so they have girth three and unbounded degree. We extend this line of working by studying obstacles among graphs of restricted girth and/or degree. We construct an infinite family of obstacles of girth four; in addition, our construction is $K_{2,3}$-subgraph-free and near-planar (planar plus one edge). Furthermore, we prove that there is a subcubic obstacle of girth three, and that there are no subcubic obstacles of high girth. We characterize the subcubic string graphs as having a matching whose contraction yields a planar graph, and based on this characterization we find a linear-time algorithm for recognizing subcubic string graphs of bounded treewidth.</description>

      <title>Watson-Crick strong bi-catenation on words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define and investigate the binary word operation of strong-$\phi$-bi-catenation (denoted by $\leftrightarrows_\phi$) where $\phi$ is either a morphic or an antimorphic involution. In particular, we concentrate on the mapping $\phi=\theta_{DNA}$, which models the Watson-Crick complementarity of DNA single strands. We show that such an operation is commutative and not associative and when iteratively applied to a word $u$, this operation generates words over $\{u, \theta(u)\}$. We then extend this operation to languages and show that the families of regular, context-free and context-sensitive languages are closed under the operation of strong-$\phi$-bi-catenation. We also define the notion of $\leftrightarrows_\theta$-conjugacy and study conditions on words $u$ and $v$ where $u$ is a $\leftrightarrows_\theta$-conjugate of $v$. We then extend this relation to language equations and provide solutions under some special cases.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Tree Parking Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore parking distributions on caterpillar trees, focusing on two primary statistics: the number of lucky cars and the frequency with which cars prefer specific parking spaces. We use first-return decomposition to reveal a symmetry in their joint distribution and develop a $q, t$-analog of the Fuss-Catalan generating function. We prove that this generating function exhibits specific symmetry and satisfies a functional equation. Additionally, we extend our findings to any m statistics that satisfy certain criteria, presenting a concrete example of such $m$ statistics to illustrate the broader applicability of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an algorithm to compute weighted Ehrhart functions of lattice polytopes for polynomial weights using Lagrange interpolation. We show how to compute generating functions of polynomials using those of unit cubes and Eulerian numbers, and use integer programming to study the algebraic properties of the Ehrhart ring of the $d$-th unit cube. Then we show some applications to weighted Ehrhart functions and enumeration problems.</description>

      <title>Affine Equivalence of Subsets of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ via Venn Diagrams and Applications to Sidon Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two subsets $S$ and $T$ of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ are \textit{affinely equivalent} if there is an affine automorphism of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ taking $S$ to $T$. Given a basis of the affine span of $S$, we can construct a Venn diagram whose regions partition $S$. We prove that any two bases of $\operatorname{aff}(S)$ will have the same Venn diagram up to a linear permutation of the Venn regions. Moreover, we prove that two sets are affinely equivalent if and only if there is a cardinality-preserving linear permutation from the Venn regions of $S$ to the Venn regions of $T$. We use these results to classify certain Sidon sets up to affine equivalence.</description>

      <title>The Oddtown problem modulo a composite number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of subsets $\mathcal{A}$ of an $n$-element set is called an $\ell$-Oddtown if the sizes of all sets are not divisible by $\ell$, but the sizes of pairwise intersections are divisible by $\ell$. Berlekamp and Graver showed that when is a $\ell$ is a prime, the maximum size of an $\ell$-Oddtown is $n$. For composite moduli with $\omega$ distinct prime factors, the argument of Szegedy gives an upper bound of $\omega n-\omega\log_2 n$ on the size of an $\ell$-Oddtown. We improve this to $\omega n-(2\omega +\varepsilon)\log_2 n$ for most $\ell$ and $n$ using a combination of linear algebraic and Fourier-analytic arguments.</description>

      <title>On Alon-Tarsi orientations of sparse graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume $G$ is a graph, $(v_1,\ldots,v_k)$ is a sequence of distinct vertices of $G$, and $(a_1,\ldots,a_k)$ is an integer sequence with $a_i \in \{1,2\}$. We say $G$ is \emph{$(a_1,\ldots,a_k)$-list extendable} (respectively, \emph{$(a_1,\ldots,a_k)$-AT extendable}) with respect to $(v_1,\ldots,v_k)$ if $G$ is $f$-choosable (respectively, $f$-AT), where $f(v_i)=a_i $ for $i \in \{1,\ldots, k\}$, and $f(v)=3$ for $v \in V(G) \setminus \{v_1,\ldots, v_k\}$. Hutchinson proved that if $G$ is an outerplanar graph, then $G$ is $(2,2)$-list extendable with respect to $(x,y)$ for any vertices $x,y$. We strengthen this result and prove that if $G$ is a $K_4$-minor-free graph, then $G$ is $(2,2)$-AT extendable with respect to $(x,y)$ for any vertices $x,y$. Then we characterize all triples $(x,y,z)$ of a $K_4$-minor-free graph $G$ for which $G$ is $(2,2,2)$-AT extendable (as well as $(2,2,2)$-list extendable) with respect to $(x,y,z)$. We also characterize the pairs $(x,y)$ of a $K_4$-minor-free graph $G$ for which $G$ is $(2,1)$-AT extendable (as well as $(2,1)$-list extendable) with respect to $(x,y)$. Moreover, we characterize all triples $(x,y,z)$ of a 3-colorable graph $G$ with its maximum average degree less than $\frac{14}{5}$ for which $G$ is $(2,2,2)$-AT extendable with respect to $(x,y,z)$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Inner Product Correlations for Hypercube Bijections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve a conjecture of Rob Morris concerning bijections on the hypercube. Specifically, we show that for any bijection $f : \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}^n$, \[ \Pr_{x,y \in \{-1,1\}^n}\big[ \langle x,y \rangle \ge 0 \;\text{and}\; \langle f(x),f(y) \rangle \ge 0 \big] \;\;\ge\; \tfrac{1}{4} - O(1/\sqrt{n}), \] implying the same lower bound for the joint event under any two bijections. Our proof proceeds by applying the spectral decomposition of the Hamming association scheme, which allows us to reformulate the problem as a linear program over the Birkhoff polytope. This makes it possible to isolate the contribution of the nontrivial spectrum, which we show is asymptotically negligible, leaving the dominant contribution arising from the principal eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Bounds on two-distance sets in Euclidean space and Unit Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish upper bounds for the size of two-distance sets in Euclidean space and spherical two-distance sets. The main recipe for obtaining upper bounds is the spectral method. We construct Seidel matrices to encode the distance relations and apply eigenvalue analysis to obtain explicit bounds.
  For Euclidean space, we have the upper bounds for the cardinality $n$ of a two-distance set. \[
  n \le \dfrac{(d+1)\left(\left(\frac{1+\delta^2}{1-\delta^2}\right)^2 - 1\right)}{\left(\frac{1+\delta^2}{1-\delta^2}\right)^2-(d+1)}+1. \] if the two distances are $1$ and $\delta$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  For spherical two-distance sets with $n$ points and inner products $a, b$ on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, we will have the following:
  \[ \begin{cases}
  n \le \dfrac{d\left(\left(\dfrac{a+b-2}{b-a}\right)^2-1\right)}{\left(\dfrac{a+b-2}{b-a}\right)^2-d}, &amp;a+b \ge 0;
  n \le \dfrac{(d+1)\left(\left(\dfrac{a+b-2}{b-a}\right)^2-1\right)}{\left(\dfrac{a+b-2}{b-a}\right)^2-(d+1)}, &amp;a+b &lt; 0. \end{cases} \] Notice that the second bound (for $a+b &lt; 0$) is the same as the relative bound for the equiangular lines in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Extended Weak Order for the Rank 3 Universal Coxeter Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak order is a classical poset structure on a Coxeter group; it is a lattice when the group is finite but merely a meet-semilattice when the group is infinite. Motivated by problems in Kazhdan--Lusztig theory, Matthew Dyer introduced the extended weak order, a poset that contains a copy of the weak order as an order ideal, and he conjectured that the extended weak order for any Coxeter group is a lattice. We prove Dyer's conjecture for the rank 3 universal Coxeter group. This is the first non-spherical, non-affine Coxeter group for which Dyer's conjecture has been proven.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $m$-distance set is a collection of points such that the distances between any two points have $m$ possible values. We use two different methods to construct large $m$-distance sets on the triangular lattices. One is to use the first m smallest distances and find the largest cliques, and the other is using the notions of hexagons. Multiplicities of the distances were observed for comparison for the two methods.</description>

      <title>Density Characterization with The Upper Bound of Density of Fibonacci Word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the natural density and structural relationships within Fibonacci words, the density of a Fibonacci word is $\operatorname{DF}(F_k)=n/(n+m),$ where $m$ denote the number of zeros in a Fibonacci word and $n$ denote the units digit. Through analysis of these ratios and their convergence to powers of $\varphi$, we illustrate the intrinsic exponential growth rates characteristic of Fibonacci words. By considering the natural density concept for sets of positive integers, it is demonstrated that the density of Fibonacci words approaches unity, correlating with classical results on Fibonacci number distributions as \[ \operatorname{DF}(F_k) &lt;\frac{m(m+1)}{n(2m-n+1)}. \] Furthermore, generating functions and combinatorial formulas for general terms of Fibonacci words are derived, linking polynomial expressions and limit behaviors integral to their combinatorial structure. The study is supplemented by numerical data and graphical visualization, confirming theoretical findings and providing insights into the early transient and asymptotic behavior of Fibonacci word densities.</description>

      <title>Odd clique minors and chromatic bounds of {3$K_1$, paraglider}-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A paraglider, house, 4-wheel, is the graph that consists of a cycle $C_4$ plus an additional vertex adjacent to three vertices, two adjacent vertices, all the vertices of the $C_4$, respectively. For a graph $G$, let $\chi(G)$, $\omega(G)$ denote the chromatic number, the clique number of $G$, respectively. Gerards and Seymour from 1995 conjectured that every graph $G$ has an odd $K_{\chi(G)}$ minor. In this paper, based on the description of graph structure, it is shown that every graph $G$ with independence number two satisfies the conjecture if one of the following is true: $\chi(G) \leq 2\omega(G)$ when $n $ is even, $\chi(G) \leq 9\omega(G)/5$ when $n$ is odd, $G$ is a quasi-line graph, $G$ is $H$-free for some induced subgraph $H$ of paraglider, house or $W_4$. Moreover, we derive an optimal linear $\chi$-binding function for {3$K_1$, paraglider}-free graph $G$ that $\chi(G)\leq \max\{\omega(G)+3, 2\omega(G)-2\}$, which improves the previous result, $\chi(G)\leq 2\omega(G)$, due to Choudum, Karthick and Shalu in 2008.</description>

      <title>Scattering number and $\tau$-toughness in graphs involving $A_\alpha$-spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering number $s(G)$ of graph $G=(V,E)$ is defined as $s(G)$=max\big\{$c(G-S)-|S|$\big\}, where the maximum is taken over all proper subsets $S\subseteq V(G)$, and $c(G-S)$ denotes the number of components of $G-S$. In 1988, Enomoto introduced a variation of toughness $\tau(G)$ of a graph $G$, which is defined by $\tau(G)$=min\big\{$\frac{|S|}{c(G-S)-1}$, $S\subseteq V(G)$ and $c(G-S)&gt;1$\big\}. Both the scattering number and toughness are used to characterize the invulnerability or stability of a graph, i.e., the ability of a graph to remain connected after vertices or edges are removed. The smaller the value of $s(G)$ (or the larger the value of $\tau(G)$), the stronger the connectivity of a graph $G$. The $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius of $G$ is denoted by $\rho_{\alpha}(G)$. Using typical $A_{\alpha}$-spectral techniques and structural analysis, we present a sufficient condition such that $s(G)\leq 1$. This result generalizes the result of Chen, Li and Xu [Graphs Comb. 41 (2025)]. Furthermore, we establish a sufficient condition with respect to the $A_{\alpha}$-spectral radius for a graph to be $\tau$-tough. When $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$, our result reduces to that of Chen, Li and Xu [Graphs Comb. 41 (2025)].</description>

      <title>Graphs with girth $2\ell$ and without longer even holes are $3$-colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a number $\ell\geq 2$, let $\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$ denote the family of graphs which have girth $2\ell$ and have no even hole with length greater than $2\ell$. Wu, Xu, and Xu conjectured that every graph in $\bigcup_{\ell\geq2}\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$ is 3-colorable. In this paper, we prove that every graph in $\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$ is 3-colorable for any integer $\ell\geq5$.</description>

      <title>Tree decompositions with small width, spread, order and degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree-decompositions of graphs are of fundamental importance in structural and algorithmic graph theory. The main property of tree-decompositions is the width (the maximum size of a bag $-1$). We show that every graph has a tree-decomposition with near-optimal width, plus several additional properties of interest. In particular every graph $G$ with treewidth at most $k$ has a tree-decomposition with width at most $72k+1$, where each vertex $v$ appears in at most $\text{deg}_G(v)+1$ bags, the number of bags is at most $\max\{\frac{|V(G)|}{2k},1\}$, and the tree indexing the decomposition has maximum degree at most 12. This improves exponential bounds to linear in a result of Ding and Oporowski [1995], and establishes a conjecture of theirs in a strong sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2012, Andrews and Merca proved a truncated theorem on Euler's pentagonal number theorem, which opened up a new study on truncated theta series. In particular, some results on a truncated identity of Guass have been proved. In this article, we provide a new combinatorial interpretation of the truncated identity of Gauss in terms of the minimal excludant non-overlined part of an overpartition.</description>

      <title>On the chromatic number of random triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chromatic number of typical triangle-free graphs with $\Theta \left( n^{3/2} (\log n)^{1/2} \right)$ edges and establish the width of the scaling window for the transitions from $\chi = 3$ to $\chi = 4$ and from $\chi = 4$ to $\chi = 5$.
  The transition from $3$- to $4$-colorability has scaling window of width $\Theta(n^{4/3} (\log n)^{-1/3})$. To prove this, we show a high probability equivalence of the $3$-colorability of a random triangle-free graph at this density and the satisfiability of an instance of bipartite random $2$-SAT, for which we establish the width of the scaling window following the techniques of Bollob{\'a}s, Borgs, Chayes, Kim, and Wilson.
  The transition from $4$- to $5$-colorability has scaling window of width $\Theta(n^{3/2} (\log n)^{-1/2})$. To prove this, we show a high probability equivalence of the $4$-colorability of a random triangle-free graph at this density and the simultaneous $2$-colorability of two independent Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs. For this transition, we also establish the limiting probability of $4$-colorability inside the scaling window.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Ferber-Krivelevich and Gallai Theorems on parity of degrees in induced subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing and well-known conjecture (see e.g. Caro, Discrete Math, 1994) states that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ without isolated vertices contains an induced subgraph where all vertices have an odd degree and whose order is linear in $n$. Ferber and Krivelevich (Adv. Math., 2022) confirmed the conjecture. In this short paper, we generalize this result by considering $G$ with vertices labeled 0 or 1 and requiring that in an induced subgraph of $G$, the 0-labeled vertices are of even degree and the 1-labeled vertices are of odd degree. We prove that if $G$ has no isolated vertices, it contains such a subgraph of order linear in $n$.
  The well-known Gallai's Theorem states that the vertices of each graph can be partitioned into two parts such that all vertices in the subgraphs induced by the two parts have even degrees. The result also holds if we require that the degrees of all vertices in one of the induced subgraphs are even, and the degrees of all vertices in the other induced subgraph are odd. A natural generalization of Gallai's Theorem to out-degrees in digraphs does not hold and we characterize all digraphs for which it does hold. Our characterization is linear algebraic.</description>

      <title>New Results on Vertices that Belong to Every Minimum Locating-Dominating Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locating-dominating codes have been studied widely since their introduction in the 1980s by Slater and Rall. In this paper, we concentrate on vertices that must belong to all minimum locating-dominating codes in a graph. We call them min-forced vertices. We show that the number of min-forced vertices in a connected nontrivial graph of order $n$ is bounded above by $\frac{2}{3}\left(n -\gamma^{LD}(G)\right)$, where $\gamma^{LD}(G)$ denotes the cardinality of a minimum locating-dominating code. This implies that the maximum ratio between the number of min-forced vertices and the order of a connected nontrivial graph is at most $\frac{2}{5}$. Moreover, both of these bounds can be attained. We also determine the number of different minimum locating-dominating codes in all paths. In addition, we show that deciding whether a vertex is min-forced is co-NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Degree-similar graphs and cospectral graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A(G)$ and degree matrix $D(G)$, and let $L_\mu(G):=A(G)-\mu D(G)$. Two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ are called \emph{degree-similar} if there exists an invertible matrix $M$ such that $M^{-1} A(G_1) M =A(G_2)$ and $M^{-1} D(G_1) M =D(G_2)$. In this paper, we address three problems concerning degree-similar graphs proposed by Godsil and Sun. First, we present a new characterization of degree-similar graphs using degree partition, from which we derive methods and examples for constructing cospectral graphs and degree-similar graphs. Second, we construct infinite pairs of non-degree-similar trees $G_1$ and $G_2$ such that $tI- L_\mu(G_1)$ and $tI-L_\mu(G_2)$ have the same Smith normal form over $\Q(\mu)[t]$, which provides a negative answer to a problem posed by Godsil and Sun. Third, we establish several invariants of degree-similar graphs and obtain results on unicyclic graphs that are degree-similar determined. Lastly we prove that for a strongly regular graph $G$ and any two edges $e$ and $f$ of $G$, $G \backslash e$ and $G \backslash f$ have identical $\mu$-polynomial, i.e., $\det(tI-L_\mu(G \backslash e))=\det(tI-L_\mu(G \backslash f))$, which enables the construction of pairs of non-isomorphic graphs with same $\mu$-polynomial, where $G \backslash e$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by deleting the edge $e$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph and let $S$ be a subset of its vertices. We say that $S$ is $P_3$-convex if every vertex $v \in V(G)$ that has at least two neighbors in $S$ also belongs to $S$. The $P_3$-hull set of $S$ is the smallest $P_3$-convex set of $G$ that contains $S$. Carath\'eodory number of a graph $G$, denoted by $c(G)$, is the smallest integer $c$ such that for every subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ and every vertex $p$ in the $P_3$-hull of $S$, there exists a subset $F \subseteq S$ with $|F| \leq c$ such that $p$ belongs to the $P_3$-hull of $F$. In this article, we present upper bounds and formulas for the $P_3$-Carath\'eodory number in Hamming graphs, which are defined as the Cartesian product of $n$ complete graphs.</description>

Moreover, we present the full characterization of all non $4$-colorable connected $(bull,claw)$-free graphs and $(bull,chair, C_5)$-free graphs, and all non $5$-colorable connected $(bull, claw, C_5)$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Abelian and Dihedral equiangular tight frames of redundancy $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies group frames ($G$-frames) where the unitary group representation can be projective. When the group is abelian, for most combinations $N, n$, we show that $ETF(N,n)$ can only exist for genuinely projective group representations. In particular, cyclic-group frames for such parameters do not exist. We also give a characterization of all dihedral tight frames and dihedral $ETF(2n,n)$, using which, we conclude that regular dihedral $ETF(2n,n)$ must be genuinely projective. Following that, we give a characterization of regular dihedral $ETF(2n,n)$ in terms of certain structured skew Hadamard matrices. We then show that Paley $ETF(2n,n)$ and its doubling are both of this type. Finally, we classify all regular dihedral $ETF(2n,n)$ for $n\le 22$ up to switching equivalence.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic components with many edges in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an $r$-coloring of edges of the complete graph on $n$ vertices, how many edges are there in the largest monochromatic connected component? A construction of Gy\'arf\'as shows that for infinitely many values of $r$, there exist colorings where all monochromatic components have at most $\left(\frac{1}{r^2-r}+o(1)\right)\binom{n}{2}$ edges. Conlon, Luo, and Tyomkyn conjectured that components with at least this many edges are attainable for all $r \ge 3$. Conlon, Luo, and Tyomkyn proved this conjecture for $r=3$ and Luo proved it for $r=4$, along with a lower bound of $\frac{1}{r^2-r+\frac54}{n\choose 2}$ for all $r\ge 2$ and $n$.
  In this paper, we look at extensions of this problem where the graph being $r$-colored is a sparse random graph or a graph of high minimum degree. By extending several intermediate technical results from previous work in the complete graph setting, we prove analogues of the bound for general $r$ in both the sparse random setting and the high minimum degree setting, as well as the bound for $r=3$ in the latter setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give a new generalization of token graphs. Given two integers $1\leq m \leq k$ and a graph $G$ we define the generalized token graph of the graph $G$, to be the graph $F_k^m(G)$ whose vertices correspond to configurations of $k$ indistinguishable tokens placed at distinct vertices of $G$, where two configurations are adjacent whenever one configuration can be reached from the other by moving $m$ tokens along $m$ edges of $G$. When $m=1$, the usual token graph $F_k(G)$ is recovered.
  We give sufficient and necessary conditions on the graph $G$ for $F_2^2(G)$ to be connected and
  we give sufficient and necessary conditions on the graph $G$ for $F_2^2(G)$ to be bipartite.
  We also analyze some properties of generalized token graphs, such as clique number, chromatic number, independence number and domination number. Finally, we conclude with an analysis of the automorphism group of the generalized token graph.</description>

      <title>A Study of Fibonacci Cordial Labeling in Structured Graph Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{Fibonacci cordial labeling} of a graph \( G \) is an injective function \( f: V(G) \rightarrow \{F_0, F_1, \dots, F_n\} \), where \( F_i \) denotes the \( i^{\text{th}} \) Fibonacci number, such that the induced edge labeling \( f^*: E(G) \rightarrow \{0,1\} \), given by \( f^*(uv) = (f(u) + f(v)) \) $(\bmod\ 2)$, satisfies the balance condition \( |e_f(0) - e_f(1)| \le 1 \). Here, \( e_f(0) \) and \( e_f(1) \) represent the number of edges labeled 0 and 1, respectively. A graph that admits such a labeling is termed a \emph{Fibonacci cordial graph}. In this paper, we investigate the existence and construction of Fibonacci cordial labelings for several families of graphs, including \emph{Generalized Petersen graphs}, \emph{open and closed helm graphs}, \emph{joint sum graphs}, and \emph{circulant graphs of small order}. New results and examples are presented, contributing to the growing body of knowledge on graph labelings inspired by numerical sequences.</description>

      <title>Size of bipartite graphs with given diameter and connectivity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper we determine the maximum size of a (finite, simple, connected) bipartite graph of given order, diameter $d$, and connectivity $\kappa$.
  It was shown by Ali, Mazorodze, Mukwembi and Vetr\'ik [On size, order, diameter and edge-connectivity of graphs. Acta Math. Hungar. {\bf 152}, (2017)] that for a connected triangle-free graph of order $n$, diameter $d$ and edge-connectivity $\lambda$, the size is bounded from above by about $\frac{1}{4}\left(n-\frac{(\lambda +c) d}{2}\right)^2+O(n)$, where $c\in\{0, \frac{1}{3}, 1\}$ for different values of $\lambda$.
  In the second part of this paper we show that this bound by Ali et al. on the size can be improved significantly for a much larger subclass of triangle-free graphs, namely, bipartite graphs of order $n$, diameter $d$ and edge-connectivity $\lambda$. We prove our result only for $\lambda = 2, 3, 4$ because it can be observed from this paper by Ali et al. that for $\lambda\geq 5$, there exists $\ell$-edge-connected bipartite graphs of given order and diameter whose size differs from the maximal size for given minimum degree $\ell$ only by at most a constant. Also, unlike the approach in the proof on the size of triangle-free graphs by Ali et al., our proof employs a completely different technique, which enables us to identify the extremal graphs; hence the bounds presented here are sharp.</description>

      <title>Hybrid pipe dreams for the lower-upper scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [KU23] were introduced hybrid pipe dreams interpolating between classic and bumpless pipe dreams, each hybridization giving a different formula for double Schubert polynomials. A bijective proof was given (following [GH23]) of the independence of hybridization, but only for nonequivariant Schubert polynomials. In this paper we further generalize to hybrid generic pipe dreams, replacing the bijective proof of hybridization-independence with a Yang-Baxter-based proof that allows one to maintain equivariance. An additional YB-based proof establishes a divided-difference type recurrence for these generic pipe dream polynomials. These polynomials compute something richer than double Schubert polynomials, namely the equivariant classes of the lower-upper varieties introduced in [Knu05]. We give two proofs of this: the easier being a proof that the recurrence relation holds on those classes, the more difficult being a degeneration of the lower-upper variety to a union of quadratic complete intersections (plus, possibly, some embedded components) whose individual classes match those of the generic pipe dreams. One new feature of the generic situation is a definition of the "flux" through an edge of the matrix; the notion of pipe dream itself can then be derived from the equalities among the fluxes.</description>

      <title>On new proper Jordan schemes related to quaternion and octonion algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction of a Jordan scheme from an elementary abelian $2$-group of rank $n$ and a $\{1,-1\}$-matrix of order $2^n$ that satisfies a specified condition. We then prove that the orders of matrices with the specified condition are limited to $2, 4$ or $8$. Using these matrices, we construct essentially two new proper Jordan schemes of orders $16$ and $32$. Finally, we analyze the structures of the real adjacency Jordan algebras of these Jordan schemes and prove that they are the first known examples whose real adjacency Jordan algebras admit simple components of type $\mathbb{R} \oplus_f \mathbb{R}^n$, namely non-Hermitian type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An old conjecture of Gallai states that every $n$ vertex graph can be decomposed, that is $E(G)$ can be partitioned, into $\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil$ or fewer paths. In response to this conjecture, Lov\'asz proved in 1968 that every $n$ vertex graph can be decomposed into $\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ or fewer cycles and paths. We study a related conjecture which states that every $n$ vertex graph can be decomposed into $n-1$ or fewer cycles and edges. We prove this conjecture for all graphs with maximum degree at most $4$. We also show that every $n$ vertex claw-free graph can be decomposed into $n-1$ or fewer $2$-regular subgraphs and edges. In addition, we consider the analogues covering problem. We prove that every graph $G$ containing a cycle can be covered by $n-2$ or fewer cycles and edges.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius and homeomorphically irreducible spanning trees of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a connected graph $G$, a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ is called a homeomorphically irreducible spanning tree (HIST) if $T$ has no vertices of degree 2. Albertson {\em et al.} proved that it is $NP$-complete to decide whether a graph contains a HIST. In this paper, we provide some spectral conditions that guarantee the existence of a HIST in a connected graph. Furthermore, we also present some sufficient conditions in terms of the order of a graph $G$ to ensure the existence of a HIST in $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characteristic quasi-polynomials enumerate the number of points in the complement of hyperplane arrangements modulo positive integers. In this paper, we compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials of the restrictions of the Shi arrangements of type C and type D by one given hyperplane, respectively. The case of type C is established by extending the method developed in our previous work on type B (\cite{HN2024}), while the case of type D is deduced through a direct connection with the results on type B. As a corollary, we determine whether period collapse occurs in the characteristic quasi-polynomials of the deletions of the Shi arrangements of type C and type D.</description>

Abstract: For a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, Lin \textit{et al.} \cite{Lin} define the \textit{atom--bond sum-connectivity} ($ABS$) matrix of $G$ such that the $(i,j)^{\text{th}}$ entry is \[ \sqrt{1 - \frac{2}{d_i + d_j}} \] if vertex $v_i$ is adjacent to the vertex $v_j$, and $0$ otherwise. In this article, we determine the characteristic polynomial of the $ABS$ matrix for certain specific classes of graphs. Furthermore, we compute the $ABS$ eigenvalues and the $ABS$ energy for these classes.</description>

      <title>On lower bounds for the distances between APN functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether two distinct APN functions can have a Hamming distance of $1$ remains an open problem. In 2020, L. Budaghyan et al. introduced a new CCZ-invariant $\Pi_F$ which can be used to provide lower bounds on the Hamming distance between a given APN function $F \colon \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{F}_2^n$ and other APN functions. Lower bounds on the distance from an APN function $F$ to any other are known for almost bent (AB) functions and when $F$ is a 3-to-1 quadratic function with $n$ even. In this paper, we reinterpret $\Pi_F$ in terms of the exclude multiplicities of the graph $\mathcal{G}_F=\{(x, F(x)) : x \in \mathbb{F}_2^n\}$ of $F$ as a Sidon set. We establish lower bounds on the distance for even $n$ when $F$ is plateaued APN, generalize the known lower bounds for quadratic $3$-to-$1$ function to all 3-to-1 plateaued functions (e.g. Kasami functions), and derive new lower bounds for when $F$ is the APN inverse function over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ for $n$ odd. We also study how the exclude multiplicities of $\mathcal{G}_F$ are directly connected to the existence of linear structures of $\gamma_F$ when $F$ is plateaued and APN and the ortho-derivative when $F$ is a quadratic APN function. We also use the CCZ-invariance of exclude multiplicities to prove that the Brinkmann-Leander-Edel-Pott function is not CCZ-equivalent to a plateaued function.</description>

In particular, we give classical and quantum polynomial-time algorithms that, for $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ with doubling constant $K$, learn an explicit description of a subspace $V \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ of size $|V| \leq |A|$ such that $A$ can be covered by $K^C$ translates of $V$, for a universal constant $C&gt;1$.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent work on (re)mixed Eulerian numbers, we provide a combinatorial interpretation of a subfamily of the remixed Eulerian numbers introduced by Nadeau and Tewari. More specifically, we show that these numbers can be realized as the generating polynomials of permutations with respect to the statistics of left-to-right minima, right-to-left minima, descents, and the mixed major index. Our results generalize both the bi-Stirling-Eulerian polynomials of Carlitz-Scoville and the Stirling-Euler-Mahonian polynomials of Butler.</description>

      <title>Visibility polynomial of corona of two graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiagent systems, effective coordination, coverage, and communication often rely on the concept of visibility between agents or nodes within the system. Graph-theoretically, for any subset $X$ of vertices of a graph $G$, two vertices are said to be $X$-visible if there exists a shortest path between them that contains no vertex of $X$ as an internal vertex. In this paper, we investigate the visibility polynomial associated with the corona product of two graphs. The visibility polynomial encodes the number of mutual-visibility sets of all orders within a graph, and the process of enumerating these sets provides a deeper understanding of their structural properties. We characterize the structure of mutual-visibility sets arising specifically within the corona product. As part of this study, we introduce the notion of $C_Q$-visible sets, defined with respect to a selected subset $Q$ of vertices in a graph $G$. A $C_Q$-visible set is a collection of vertices in $\overline{Q}$ that is not only $Q$-visible, but also individually visible from each vertex in $Q$. Using this concept, we establish several characterizations and properties of mutual-visibility sets within the corona product, thereby providing deeper insights into their structure and behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any finite abelian group $G$ contains a collection of not too many subsets with a special structure, so that for every subset $A$ of $G$ with a small doubling, there is a member $F$ of the collection that is fully contained in the sumset $A+A$ and is not much smaller than it. Using this result we obtain improved bounds for the problem of estimating the typical independence number of sparse random Cayley or Cayley-sum graphs, and for the problem of estimating the smallest size of a subset of $G$ which is not a sumset. We also obtain tight bounds for the typical maximum length of an arithmetic progression in the sumset of a sparse random subset of $G$.</description>

      <title>Distance-based (and path-based) covering problems for graphs of given cyclomatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a large family of graph covering problems, whose definitions rely on distances, for graphs of bounded cyclomatic number (that is, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from the graph to destroy all cycles). These problems include (but are not restricted to) three families of problems: (i) variants of metric dimension, where one wants to choose a small set $S$ of vertices of the graph such that every vertex is uniquely determined by its ordered vector of distances to the vertices of $S$; (ii) variants of geodetic sets, where one wants to select a small set $S$ of vertices such that any vertex lies on some shortest path between two vertices of $S$; (iii) variants of path covers, where one wants to select a small set of paths such that every vertex or edge belongs to one of the paths. We generalize and/or improve previous results in the area which show that the optimal values for these problems can be upper-bounded by a linear function of the cyclomatic number and the degree~1-vertices of the graph. To this end, we develop and enhance a technique recently introduced in [C. Lu, Q. Ye, C. Zhu. Algorithmic aspect on the minimum (weighted) doubly resolving set problem of graphs, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization 44:2029--2039, 2022] and give near-optimal bounds in several cases. This solves (in some cases fully, in some cases partially) some conjectures and open questions from the literature. The method, based on breadth-first search, is of algorithmic nature and thus, all the constructions can be computed in linear time. Our results also imply an algorithmic consequence for the computation of the optimal solutions: for some of the problems, they can be computed in polynomial time for graphs of bounded cyclomatic number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this summary paper, we present the key ideas behind the recent proof of the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for affine Artin groups, which states that complements of locally finite affine hyperplane arrangements with real equations and stable under orthogonal reflections are aspherical. We survey three facets of the argument: the combinatorics of noncrossing partition posets associated with Coxeter groups; the appearance of dual Artin groups and the question of their isomorphism with standard Artin groups; the topological models and their interplay in the proof.</description>

      <title>An easy proof of Ramanujan's famous congruences $p(5m+4)\equiv 0 \equiv \tau(5m+5) \pmod 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proof of Ramanujan's congruences $$p(5n+4) \equiv 0 \pmod 5 \text{ and } \tau(5n+5) \equiv 0 \pmod 5.$$ The proof only requires a limiting case of Jacobi's triple product, a result that Ramanujan knew well, and a technique which Ramanujan used himself to compute values of $\tau(n)$.</description>

      <title>Comparing Left and Right Quotient Sets in Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite subset $A$ of a group $G$, we define the right quotient set and the left quotient set of $A$, respectively, as $AA^{-1} := \{a_1a_2^{-1}:a_1,a_2\in A\}$, $A^{-1}A := \{a_1^{-1}a_2:a_1,a_2\in A\}$. While the right and left quotient sets are equal if $G$ is abelian, subtleties arise when $G$ is a nonabelian group, where the cardinality difference $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$ may be take on arbitrarily large values. Using the results of Martin and O'Bryant on the cardinality differences of sum sets and difference sets in $\mathbb{Z}$, we prove in the infinite dihedral group, $D_\infty \cong \mathbb{Z} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, every integer difference is achievable. Further, we prove that in $F_2$, the free group on $2$ generators, an integer difference is achievable if and only if that integer is even, and we explicitly construct subsets of $F_2$ that achieve every even integer. We further determine the minimum cardinality of $A \subset G$ so that the difference between the cardinalities of the left and right quotient sets is nonzero, depending on the existence of order $2$ elements in $G$. To prove these results, we construct difference graphs $D_A$ and $D_{A^{-1}}$ which encode equality, respectively, in the right and left quotient sets. We observe a bijection from edges in $D_A$ to edges in $D_{A^{-1}}$ and count connected components in order to obtain our results on cardinality differences $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berele row-insertion is a symplectic analogue of the Schensted row-insertion. In the present paper, we provide it with a representation theoretical interpretation via the quantum symmetric pairs of type $A\mathrm{II}$. As applications, we lift Berele's Robinson--Schensted correspondence and Kobayashi--Matsumura's Robinson--Schensted--Knuth (RSK for short) correspondence to isomorphisms of representations over a quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebra, and establish the dual RSK correspondence of type $A\mathrm{II}$.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Aspects of Weighted Free Poisson Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper will be devoted to study weighted (deformed) free Poisson random variables from the viewpoint of orthogonal polynomials and statistics of non-crossing partitions. A family of weighted (deformed) free Poisson random variables will be defined in a sense by the sum of weighted (deformed) free creation, annihilation, scalar, and intermediate operators with certain parameters on a weighted (deformed) free Fock space together with the vacuum expectation. We shall provide a combinatorial moment formula of non-commutative Poisson random variables. This formula gives us a very nice combinatorial interpretation to two parameters of weights. One can see that the deformation treated in this paper interpolates free and boolean Poisson random variables, their distributions and moments, and yields some conditionally free Poisson distribution by taking limit of the parameter.</description>

      <title>Binomial edge ideals of Cameron-Walker graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Cameron--Walker graph on $n$ vertices and $J_G$ the binomial edge ideal of $G$. Let $S$ denote the polynomial ring in $2n$ variables over a field. It is shown that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) $S/J_G$ is Cohen--Macaulay; (ii) $J_G$ is unmixed; (iii) $\dim (S/J_G) = n+1$; (iv) (a) $n = 3$ and $G$ is a path of length $2$ or (b) $n = 5$ and $G$ is a path of length $4$ or (c) $n=5$ and $G$ is obtained by attaching a path of length $2$ to a triangle. Moreover, the depth of $S/J_G$ is computed for a class of Cameron--Walker graphs, called minimal dense Cameron--Walker graphs. As an application, it is proved that finite graphs $G$ with $\depth(S/J_G)=6$ can have any number of vertices~$n\geq 6$. Finally, it is shown that given integers $t,n$ with $6\leq t\leq n+1$, there exists a finite connected graph $G$ with $\depth (S/J_G)=t$.</description>

      <title>Modular isomorphisms of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$-plethysms for Weyl modules labelled by hook partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta^\lambda$ be the Weyl functor for the partition $\lambda$ and let $E$ be the natural $2$-dimensional representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is an arbitrary field. We give an explicit isomorphism showing that any $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$-plethysm $\Delta^{(M,1^N)}\mathrm{Sym}^d E$ factors as a tensor product of two simpler $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$-plethysms, each defined using only symmetric powers. This result categorifies Stanley's Hook Content Formula for hook-shaped partitions and proves a conjecture of Mart\'inez--Wildon (2024). In a similar spirit we categorify the classical binomial identity $\binom{a}{b}\binom{b}{c}=\binom{a}{c}\binom{a-c}{b-c}$, obtaining a new family of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$-isomorphisms between tensor products of plethysms. Our methods are characteristic independent and provide a framework that is broadly applicable to the study of isomorphisms between plethystic representations of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F})$.</description>

      <title>Arcs with increasing chords in $\mathbf{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A curve $\gamma$ that connects $s$ and $t$ has the increasing chord property if $|bc| \leq |ad|$ whenever $a,b,c,d$ lie in that order on $\gamma$. For planar curves, the length of such a curve is known to be at most $2\pi/3 \cdot |st|$. Here we examine the question in higher dimensions and from the algorithmic standpoint and show the following:
  (I) The length of any $s-t$ curve with increasing chords in $\mathbf{R}^d$ is at most $2 \cdot \left( e/2 \cdot (d+4) \right)^{d-1} \cdot |st|$ for every $d \geq 3$. This is the first bound in higher dimensions.
  (II) Given a polygonal chain $P=(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$ in $\mathbf{R}^d$, where $d \geq 4$, $k =\lfloor d/2 \rfloor$, it can be tested whether it satisfies the increasing chord property in $O\left(n^{2-1/(k+1)} {\rm polylog} (n) \right)$ expected time. This is the first subquadratic algorithm in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Polynomiality of the Striling coefficients of $c(\mathrm{Pol}^d(\mathbb{C}^n))$ and Fano schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the $d$-dependence of $c(\mathrm{Pol}^d(\mathbb{C}^n))$, the Chern class of the $\mathrm{GL}(n)$-representation of degree $d$ homogeneous polynomials in $n$ complex variables is polynomial. We also study the asymptotics of the polynomial $d$-dependence of this Chern class. We apply these results to solve a conjecture of Manivel on the degree of varieties of hypersurfaces containing linear subspaces. We also prove new formulas for the degree and Euler characteristics of Fano schemes of lines for generic hypersurfaces.
  To prove the polynomial dependence of $c(\mathrm{Pol}^d(\mathbb{C}^n))$ we introduce the notion of Striling coefficients. This can be considered as a generalization of Stirling numbers. We express the Stirling coefficients in terms of specializations of monomial symmetric polynomials so we can deduce their polynomiality and, in certain cases, their asymptotic behaviour.</description>

      <title>On irrationals with Lagrange value exactly 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $c&gt;0$, let $X_c$ denote the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{cq^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$. It is a classical fact, known since the 1950s, that $X_c$ is uncountable for $c&gt;3$ and countable for $c&lt;3$. However, the cardinality of $X_3$ does not appear to be present in the literature. We prove that $X_3$ is uncountable.
  More generally, we show that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$, the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ with Lagrange value exactly $3$ and such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has exactly $n$ rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ is also uncountable.</description>

We prove that the Borel chromatic number of a Borel directed graph with bounded out-degree $n$ is either infinite or less than or equal to $\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.

      <description>arXiv:2509.02173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories with finite gauge groups have applications to quantum simulation and quantum gravity. Recently, the exact number of gauge-invariant states was computed for pure gauge theories on arbitrary lattices. In this work, we generalize this counting to include the case of scalar and fermionic matter, as well as various kinds of boundary conditions. As a byproduct, we consider several related questions, such as the implementation of charge conjugation for a generic finite group. These results are relevant for resource estimation and also as a crosscheck when working in a gauge-invariant basis.</description>

Abstract: Nikiforov\cite{nikiforov2017merging} introduced the concept of the $A_{\p}$-matrix as a convex linear combination of a graph's adjacency matrix and its diagonal matrix of vertex degrees. In this paper, we introduce a new variant of the $A_{\p}$-matrix, which is a linear combination of the Hermitian adjacency matrix of the second kind, $H^{\om}$, and the degree-diagonal matrix. This study provides new insights into the $A_{\p}$-matrix as a Hermitian matrix, leading to novel bounds in spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Constricting the Computational Complexity Gap of the $4$-Coloring Problem in $(P_t,C_3)$-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $k$-Coloring problem on hereditary graph classes has been a deeply researched problem over the last decade. A hereditary graph class is characterized by a (possibly infinite) list of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs. We say that a graph is $(H_1,H_2,\ldots)$-free if it does not contain any of $H_1,H_2,\ldots$ as induced subgraphs. The complexity landscape of the problem remains unclear even when restricting to the case $k=4$ and classes defined by a few forbidden induced subgraphs. While the case of only one forbidden induced subgraph has been completely resolved lately, the complexity when considering two forbidden induced subgraphs still has a couple of unknown cases. In particular, $4$-Coloring on $(P_6,C_3)$-free graphs is polynomial while it is NP-hard on $(P_{22},C_3)$-free graphs.
  We provide a reduction showing NP-completeness of $4$-Coloring on $(P_t,C_3)$-free graphs for $19\leq t\leq 21$, thus constricting the gap of cases whose complexity remains unknown. Our proof includes a computer search ensuring that the graph family obtained through the reduction is indeed $P_{19}$-free.</description>

      <title>A threshold for online balancing of sparse i.i.d. vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the task of \textit{online} vector balancing for stochastic arrivals $(X_i)_{i \in [T]}$, where the time horizon satisfies $T = \Theta(n)$, and the $X_i$ are i.i.d uniform $d$--sparse $n$--dimensional binary vectors, with $2\leq d \le (\log\log n)^2/\log\log\log n$. We show that for this range of parameters, every online algorithm incurs discrepancy at least $\Omega(\log \log n)$, and there is an efficient algorithm which achieves a matching discrepancy bound of $O(\log\log n)$ w.h.p. This establishes an asymptotic gap, both existential and algorithmic, between the online and offline versions of the average--case Beck--Fiala problem. Strikingly, the optimal online discrepancy in the considered setting is order $\log \log n$, independent of $d$ and the norms of the vectors $(X_i)_i$. Our assumptions on $d$ are nearly optimal, as this independence ceases when $d=\omega((\log\log n)^2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burning number of a graph is the minimal number of steps that are needed to burn all of its vertices, with the following burning procedure: at each step, one can choose a point to set on fire, and the fire propagates constantly at unit speed along the edges of the graph. In this paper, we consider two natural random burning procedures in the discrete Euclidean torus $\mathbb{T}_n^d$, in which the points that we set on fire at each step are random variables. Our main result deals with the case where at each step, the law of the new point that we set on fire conditionally on the past is the uniform distribution on the complement of the set of vertices burned by the previous points. In this case, we prove that as $n\to\infty$, the corresponding random burning number (i.e, the first step at which the whole torus is burned) is asymptotic to $T\cdot n^{d/(d+1)}$ in probability, where $T=T(d)\in(0,\infty)$ is the explosion time of a so-called generalised Blasius equation.</description>

Abstract: In their study of infinite flag varieties, Lam, Lee, and Shimozono (2021) introduced bumpless pipe dreams in a new combinatorial formula for double Schubert polynomials. These polynomials are the TxT-equivariant cohomology classes of matrix Schubert varieties and of their flat degenerations. We give diagonal term orders with respect to which bumpless pipe dreams index the irreducible components of diagonal Gr\"obner degenerations of matrix Schubert varieties, counted with scheme-theoretic multiplicity.
  This indexing was conjectured by Hamaker, Pechenik, and Weigandt (2022). This result establishes that bumpless pipe dreams are dual to and as geometrically natural as classical pipe dreams, for which an analogous anti-diagonal theory was developed by Knutson and Miller (2005).</description>

      <title>Bohr sets in sumsets I: Compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact abelian group and $\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3$ be continuous endomorphisms on $G$. Under certain natural assumptions on the $\phi_i$'s, we prove the existence of Bohr sets in the sumset $\phi_1(A) + \phi_2(A) + \phi_3(A)$, where $A$ is either a set of positive Haar measure, or comes from a finite partition of $G$. The first result generalizes theorems of Bogolyubov and Bergelson-Ruzsa. As a variant of the second result, we show that for any partition $\mathbb{Z} = \bigcup_{i=1}^r A_i$, there exists an $i$ such that $A_i - A_i + sA_i$ contains a Bohr set for any $s \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{ 0 \}$. The latter is a step toward an open question of Katznelson and Ruzsa.</description>

Abstract: Metric trees and metric tree arrangements index cones in the polyhedral fan structure in the Dressian $Dr(2,n)$ and $Dr(3,n)$ respectively. We introduce the notion of generalized metric tree arrangements which parameterize points in $Dr(k,n)$ and extend previously known results to $Dr(k,n)$ along with providing explicit examples of these generalized metric tree arrangements. We study the adjacency of cones in the positive Dressian $Dr_{&gt;0}(3, n)$ and introduce generalized Whitehead moves which provide a condition for adjacency of maximal cones in $Dr_{&gt;0}(3,n)$ in terms of the associated metric tree arrangements.</description>

      <title>Isometric path complexity of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00278v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set $S$ of isometric paths of a graph $G$ is ``$v$-rooted'', where $v$ is a vertex of $G$, if $v$ is one of the endpoints of all the isometric paths in $S$. The isometric path complexity of a graph $G$, denoted by $ipco{G}$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that there exists a vertex $v\in V(G)$ satisfying the following property: the vertices of any single isometric path $P$ of $G$ can be covered by $k$ many $v$-rooted isometric paths.
  First, we provide an $O(n^2 m)$-time algorithm to compute the isometric path complexity of a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Then we show that the isometric path complexity remains bounded for graphs in three seemingly unrelated graph classes, namely, hyperbolic graphs, (theta, prism, pyramid)-free graphs, and outerstring graphs.
  There is a direct algorithmic consequence of having small isometric path complexity. Specifically, we show that if the isometric path complexity of a graph $G$ is bounded by a constant, then there exists a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm for ISOMETRIC PATH COVER, whose objective is to cover all vertices of a graph with a minimum number of isometric paths. This applies to all the above graph classes.</description>

Abstract: We show that if $K\ge1$ is a parameter and $S$ is a finite symmetric subset of a group containing the identity such $|S^{2n}|\le K|S^n|$ for some integer $n\ge2K^2$, then $|S^{3n}|\le\exp(\exp(O(K^2)))|S^n|$. Such a result was previously known only under the stronger assumption that $|S^{2n+1}|\le K|S^n|$. We prove similar results for locally compact groups and vertex-transitive graphs. We indicate some results in the structure theory of vertex-transitive graphs of polynomial growth whose hypotheses can be weakened as a result.</description>

Abstract: We use a novel decomposition to create succinct data structures -- supporting a wide range of operations on static trees in constant time -- for a variety tree classes, extending results of Munro, Nicholson, Benkner, and Wild. Motivated by the class of AVL trees, we further derive asymptotics for the information-theoretic lower bound on the number of bits needed to store tree classes whose generating functions satisfy certain functional equations. In particular, we prove that AVL trees require approximately $0.938$ bits per node to encode.</description>

      <title>The Leaf Function of Penrose P2 Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a graph-theoretic problem in the Penrose P2-graphs which are the dual graphs of Penrose tilings by kites and darts. Using substitutions, local isomorphism and other properties of Penrose tilings, we construct a family of arbitrarily large induced subtrees of Penrose graphs with the largest possible number of leaves for a given number $n$ of vertices. These subtrees are called fully leafed induced subtrees. We denote their number of leaves $L_{P2}(n)$ for any non-negative integer $n$, and the sequence $\left(L_{P2}(n)\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is called the leaf function of Penrose P2-graphs. We present exact and recursive formulae for $L_{P2}(n)$, as well as an infinite sequence of fully leafed induced subtrees, which are caterpillar graphs. In particular, our proof relies on the construction of a finite graded poset of 3-internal-regular subtrees.</description>

Abstract: By using the composition method, we establish the $e$-positivity of spiders of the form $S(4m+2,\, 2m,\, 1)$, which was conjectured by Aliniaeifard, van Willigenburg and Wang. Following the divide-and-conquer strategy, we group one or two $e_J$-terms that have positive coefficients with each $e_I$-term that has a negative coefficient, where the compositions $J$ are selected to be obtained by rearranging the parts of $I$, and show the positivity of the sum of those coefficients. Our main contribution is an explicit construction of the injection.</description>

      <title>An algebraic proof of the dichotomy for graph orientation problems with forbidden tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a set F of finite tournaments, the F-free orientation problem is the problem of deciding if a given finite undirected graph can be oriented in such a way that the resulting oriented graph does not contain any member of F. Using the theory of smooth approximations, we give a new shorter proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems obtained recently by Bodirsky and Guzm\'{a}n-Pro. In fact, our approach yields a complexity dichotomy for a considerably larger class of computational problems where one is given an undirected graph along with additional local constraints on the allowed orientations. Moreover, the border between tractable and hard problems is also described by a decidable algebraic condition.</description>

      <title>On the multicolor Tur\'{a}n conjecture for color-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A {\it simple $k$-coloring} of a multigraph $G$ is a decomposition of the edge multiset as a disjoint sum of $k$ simple graphs which are referred as colors. A subgraph $H$ of a multigraph $G$ is called {\it multicolored} if its edges receive distinct colors in a given simple $k$-coloring of $G$. In 2004, Keevash-Saks-Sudakov-Verstra\"{e}te introduced the {\it $k$-color Tur\'{a}n number} $ex_k(n,H)$, which denotes the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex multigraph that has a simple $k$-coloring containing no multicolored copies of $H$. They made a conjecture for any $r\geq 3$ and $r$-color-critical graph $H$ that in the range of $k\geq \frac{r-1}{r-2}(e(H)-1)$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then $ex_k(n, H)$ is achieved by the multigraph consisting of $k$ colors all of which are identical copies of the Tur\'{a}n graph $T_{r-1}(n)$. In this paper, we show that this holds in the range of $k\geq 2\frac{r-1}{r}(e(H)-1)$, significantly improving earlier results. Our proof combines the stability argument of Chakraborti-Kim-Lee-Liu-Seo with a novel graph packing technique for embedding multigraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a proper edge coloring of a graph $G$ a B-coloring if every 4-cycle of $G$ is colored with four different colors. Let $q_B(G)$ denote the smallest number of colors needed for a B-coloring of $G$. Motivated by earlier papers on B-colorings, here we consider $q_B(G)$ for planar and outerplanar graphs in terms of the maximum degree $\Delta = \Delta(G)$. We prove that $q_B(G)\le 2\Delta+8$ for planar graphs, $q_B(G)\le 2\Delta$ for bipartite planar graphs and $q_B(G)\le \Delta+1$ for outerplanar graphs with $\Delta \ge 4$. We conjecture that, for $\Delta$ sufficiently large, $q_B(G)\le 2\Delta(G)$ for planar $G$ and $q_B(G)\le \Delta(G)$ for outerplanar $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coloring of the edges of a graph $G$ in which every $K_{1,2}$ is totally multicolored is known as a proper coloring and a coloring of the edges of $G$ in which every $K_{1,2}$ and every $K_{2,2}$ is totally multicolored is called a B-coloring.
  In this paper, we establish that a planar graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ can be B-colored with $\max\{2\Delta,32\}$ colors. This is best-possible for large $\Delta$ because $K_{2,\Delta}$ requires $2\Delta$ colors. In addition, there is an example with $\Delta=4$ that requires $12$ colors.
  We also establish that an outerplanar graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ can be B-colored with $\max\{\Delta,6\}$ colors. This is almost best-possible because $\Delta$ colors are necessary and there is an example with $\Delta=4$ that requires $5$ colors.</description>

      <title>Characterizing real-representable matroids with large average hyperplane-size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing a theorem of the first two authors and Geelen for planes, we show that, for a real-representable matroid $M$, either the average hyperplane-size in $M$ is at most a constant depending only on its rank, or each hyperplane of $M$ contains one of a set of at most $r(M)-2$ lines. Additionally, in the latter case, the ground set of $M$ has a partition $(E_{1}, E_{2})$, where $E_{1}$ can be covered by few flats of relatively low rank and $|E_{2}|$ is bounded. These results extend to complex-representable and orientable matroids. Finally, we formulate a high-dimensional generalization of a classic problem of Motzkin, Gr\"unbaum, Erd\H{o}s and Purdy on sets of red and blue points in the plane with no monochromatic blue line. We show that the solution to this problem gives a tight upper bound on $|E_{2}|$. We also discuss this high-dimensional problem in its own right, and prove some initial results.</description>

      <title>Tropicalizing Principal Minors of Positive Definite Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the tropicalization of the image of the cone of positive definite matrices under the principal minors map. It is a polyhedral subset of the set of $M$-concave functions on the discrete $n$-dimensional cube. We show it coincides with the intersection of the affine tropical flag variety with the submodular cone. In particular, any cell in the regular subdivision of the cube induced by a point in this tropicalization can be subdivided into base polytopes of realizable matroids. We use this tropicalization as a guide to discover new algebraic inequalities among the principal minors of positive semidefinite matrices of a fixed size. We also extend our results to positive semidefinite matrices via taking closures in the tropical semifield $\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}$.</description>

      <title>Spreading in claw-free cubic graphs</title>

Abstract: Let $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and $q \in \mathbb{N} \cup \lbrace \infty \rbrace$. We study a dynamic coloring of the vertices of a graph $G$ that starts with an initial subset $S$ of blue vertices, with all remaining vertices colored white. If a white vertex~$v$ has at least~$p$ blue neighbors and at least one of these blue neighbors of~$v$ has at most~$q$ white neighbors, then by the spreading color change rule the vertex~$v$ is recolored blue. The initial set $S$ of blue vertices is a $(p,q)$-spreading set for $G$ if by repeatedly applying the spreading color change rule all the vertices of $G$ are eventually colored blue. The $(p,q)$-spreading set is a generalization of the well-studied concepts of $k$-forcing and $r$-percolating sets in graphs. For $q \ge 2$, a $(1,q)$-spreading set is exactly a $q$-forcing set, and the $(1,1)$-spreading set is a $1$-forcing set (also called a zero forcing set), while for $q = \infty$, a $(p,\infty)$-spreading set is exactly a $p$-percolating set. The $(p,q)$-spreading number, $\sigma_{(p,q)}(G)$, of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a $(p,q)$-spreading set. In this paper, we study $(p,q)$-spreading in claw-free cubic graphs. While the zero-forcing number of claw-free cubic graphs was studied earlier, for each pair of values $p$ and $q$ that are not both $1$ we either determine the $(p,q)$-spreading number of a claw-free cubic graph $G$ or show that $\sigma_{(p,q)}(G)$ attains one of two possible values.</description>

      <title>A database of constructions of Hadamard matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadamard matrices of order $n$ are conjectured to exist whenever $n$ is $1$, $2$, or a multiple of $4$; a similar conjecture exists for skew Hadamard matrices. We provide constructions covering orders $\le 1208$ of all known Hadamard and skew Hadamard matrices in the open-source software SageMath. This allowed us to verify the correctness of results given in the literature. Within this range, just one order, $292$, of a skew Hadamard matrix claimed to have a known construction, required a fix.
  We also produce the up to date tables, for $n \le 2999$ (resp. $n\le 999$ for skew case), of the minimum exponents $m$ such that a (skew) Hadamard matrix of order $2^m n$ is known, improving over 100 entries in the previously published sources. We explain how tables' entries are related to Riesel numbers. As a by-product of the latter, we show that the Paley constructions of (skew-)Hadamard matrices do not work for the order $2^m 509203$, for any $m$.</description>

      <title>Long induced paths in $K_{s, s}$-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than 40 years ago, Galvin, Rival and Sands showed that every $K_{s, s}$-free graph containing an $n$-vertex path must contain an induced path of length $f(n)$, where $f(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$. Recently, it was shown by Duron, Esperet and Raymond that one can take $f(n)=(\log \log n)^{1/5-o(1)}$. In this note, we give a short self-contained proof that a $K_{s, s}$-free graphs with an $n$-vertex path contains an induced path of length at least $(\log \log n)^{1-o(1)}$. Combined with the recent remarkable example of Cou\"etoux, Defrain, and Raymond, which provides an upper bound of $O((\log \log n)^{1+o(1)})$, this essentially resolves this old problem.</description>

      <title>Pattern avoidance in nonnesting permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00336v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonnesting permutations are permutations of the multiset $\{1,1,2,2,\dots,n,n\}$ that avoid subsequences of the form $abba$ for any $a\neq b$. These permutations have recently been studied in connection to noncrossing (also called quasi-Stirling) permutations, which are those that avoid subsequences of the form $abab$, and in turn generalize the well-known Stirling permutations. Inspired by the work by Archer et al. on pattern avoidance in noncrossing permutations, we consider the analogous problem in the nonnesting case. We enumerate nonnesting permutations that avoid each set of two or more patterns of length 3, as well as those that avoid some sets of patterns of length 4. We obtain closed formulas and generating functions, some of which involve unexpected appearances of the Catalan and Fibonacci numbers. Our proofs rely on decompositions, recurrences, and bijections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2011, Barot and Marsh provided an explicit construction of presentation of a finite Weyl group $W$ by any quiver mutation-equivalent to an orientation of a Dynkin diagram with Weyl group $W$. The construction was extended by the authors of the present paper to obtain presentations for all affine Coxeter groups, as well as to construct groups from triangulations of unpunctured surfaces and orbifolds, where the groups are invariant under change of triangulation and thus are presented as quotients of numerous distinct Coxeter groups. We extend the construction to include most punctured surfaces and orbifolds, providing a new invariant for almost all marked surfaces.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of directed-cycle and catenary linear compartment models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parameter of a mathematical model is structurally identifiable if it can be determined from noiseless experimental data. Here, we examine the identifiability properties of two important classes of linear compartmental models: directed-cycle models and catenary models (models for which the underlying graph is a directed cycle or a bidirected path, respectively). Our main result is a complete characterization of the directed-cycle models for which every parameter is (generically locally) identifiable. Additionally, for catenary models, we give a formula for their input-output equations. Such equations are used to analyze identifiability, so we expect our formula to support future analyses into the identifiability of catenary models. Our proofs rely on prior results on input-output equations, and we also use techniques from linear algebra and graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of pattern avoidance in rectangulations. We give a formal definition of such patterns and investigate rectangulations that avoid $\top$-like patterns - the pattern $\top$ and its rotations. For every $L \subseteq \{\top, \, \vdash, \, \bot, \, \dashv \}$ we enumerate $L$-avoiding rectangulations, both weak and strong. In particular, we show $\top$-avoiding weak rectangulations are enumerated by Catalan numbers and construct bijections to several Catalan structures. Then, we prove that $\top$-avoiding strong rectangulations are in bijection with several classes of inversion sequences, among them $I(010,101,120,201)$ and $I(011,201)$ - which leads to a solution of the conjecture that these classes are Wilf-equivalent. Finally, we show that $\{\top, \bot\}$-avoiding strong rectangulations are in bijection with recently introduced rushed Dyck paths.</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation Guided Decimation on Random k-XORSAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the performance of Belief Propagation Guided Decimation, a physics-inspired message passing algorithm, on the random $k$-XORSAT problem. Specifically, we derive an explicit threshold up to which the algorithm succeeds with a strictly positive probability $\Omega(1)$ that we compute explicitly, but beyond which the algorithm with high probability fails to find a satisfying assignment. In addition, we analyse a thought experiment called the decimation process for which we identify a (non-) reconstruction and a condensation phase transition. The main results of the present work confirm physics predictions from [RTS: J. Stat. Mech. 2009] that link the phase transitions of the decimation process with the performance of the algorithm, and improve over partial results from a recent article [Yung: Proc. ICALP 2024].</description>

      <title>On the $E$-base of Finite Lattices: Semidistributive, Modular, and Geometric Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicational bases are a well-known representation of closure spaces and their closure lattices. This representation is not unique, though, and a closure space usually admits multiple bases. Among these, the canonical base, the canonical direct base as well as the $D$-base aroused significant attention due to their structural and algorithmic properties. Recently, a new base has emerged from the study of free lattices: the $E$-base. It is a refinement of the $D$-base that, unlike the aforementioned implicational bases, does not always accurately represent its associated closure space. This leads to an intriguing question: for which classes of (closure) lattices do closure spaces have valid $E$-base? Lower-bounded lattices are known to form such a class. In this paper, we prove that for semidistributive lattices, the $E$-base is both valid and minimum. We also characterize those modular and geometric lattices that have valid $E$-base. Finally, we prove that any lattice is a sublattice of a lattice with valid $E$-base.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is $H$-induced-saturated if $G$ is $H$-free but deleting any edge or adding any edge creates an induced copy of $H$. There are non-trivial graphs $H$, such as $P_4$, for which no finite $H$-induced-saturated graph $G$ exists. We show that for every finite graph $H$ that is not a clique or an independent set, there always exists a countable $H$-induced-saturated graph. In fact, we show that a far stronger property can be achieved: there is a countably infinite $H$-free graph $G$ such that any graph $G'\ne G$ obtained by making a locally finite set of changes to $G$ contains a copy of $H$.</description>

Abstract: Suppose that $\mathscr{F}$ is a finite union-closed family of sets with $\cup_{A\in \mathscr{F}}A=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$ and $m\geq 2$. Fix $i\in \{1,2,\ldots,m\}$ and denote $\mathscr{G}:=\{A\backslash \{i\}: A\in \mathscr{F}\}$. For $j\in \{1,2,\ldots,m\}\backslash\{i\}$, let $\mathscr{G}_j:=\{A\in\mathscr{G}: j\in A\}$ and $\mathscr{F}_j:=\{A\in\mathscr{F}: j\in A\}$. In this note, we will prove a lemma which says that if $\frac{|\mathscr{G}_j|}{|\mathscr{G}|}\geq c\,(c\in (0,1])$, then $\frac{|\mathscr{F}_j|}{|\mathscr{F}|}\geq \frac{1}{1+2(1-c)/c}$. Several applications of this lemma will be given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain several new upper bounds of the odd graceful chromatic number of a graph $G$, which must be bipartite. Some of our bounds depend only on the number of the vertices of $G$ or the chromatic number of some graphs related to the bipartition of $G$.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of generalized Tur\'{a}n Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph is called $\mathcal{F}$-free if it does not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$. Generalized Tur\'{a}n problems aim to maximize the number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph. This maximum is denoted by $ex(n, H, \mathcal{F})$. When $H \cong K_2$, it is simply denoted by $ex(n,F)$. Erd\H{o}s and Gallai established the bounds $ex(n, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$ and $ex(n, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. This was later extended by Luo \cite{luo2018maximum}, who showed that $ex(n, K_s, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n}{k} \binom{k}{s}$ and $ex(n, K_s, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{n-1}{k-1} \binom{k}{s}$. Let $N(G,K_s)$ denote the number of copies of $K_s$ in $G$. In this paper, we use the vertex-based localization framework, introduced in \cite{adak2025vertex}, to generalize Luo's bounds. In a graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, define $p(v)$ to be the length of the longest path that contains $v$. We show that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{1}{p(v)+1}{p(v)+1\choose s} = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{v \in V(G)}{p(v) \choose s-1}\] We strengthen the cycle bound from \cite{luo2018maximum} as follows: In graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle that contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \left(\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{1}{c(v)-1}{c(v) \choose s}\right) - \frac{1}{c(u)-1}{c(u) \choose s}\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality for these bounds. We provide full proofs for the cases $s = 1$ and $s \geq 3$, while the case $s = 2$ follows from the result in \cite{adak2025vertex}.</description>

      <title>Localized Clique Bounds in Bounded-Degree and Bounded-Path Graphs</title>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph is said to be $\mathcal{F}$-free if it contains no member of $\mathcal{F}$. The generalized Tur\'{a}n number $ex(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph, while the generalized edge Tur\'{a}n number $mex(m,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $m$-edge $\mathcal{F}$-free graph.
  It is well known that if a graph has maximum degree $d$, then it is $K_{1,d+1}$-free. Wood \cite{wood} proved that $ex(n,K_t,K_{1,d+1}) \leq \frac{n}{d+1}\binom{d+1}{t}$. More recently, Chakraborty and Chen \cite{CHAKRABORTI2024103955} established analogous bounds for graphs with bounded maximum path length: $mex(m,K_t,P_{r+1}) \leq \frac{m}{\binom{r}{2}}\binom{r}{t}$.
  In this paper, we improve these bounds using the localization technique, based on suitably defined local parameters. Furthermore, we characterize the extremal graphs attaining these improved bounds.</description>

      <title>Moments, Sums of Squares, and Tropicalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use tropicalization to study the duals to cones of nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares on a semialgebraic set $S$. The truncated cones of moments of measures supported on the set $S$ is dual to nonnegative polynomials on $S$, while "pseudo-moments" are dual to sums of squares approximations to nonnegative polynomials. We provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of tropicalizations of the moment and pseudo-moment cones, and demonstrate their usefulness in distinguishing between nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares. We give examples that show new limitations of sums of squares approximations of nonnegative polynomials. When the semialgebraic set is defined by binomial inequalites, its moment and pseudo-moment cones are closed under Hadamard product. In this case, their tropicalizations are polyhedral cones that encode all binomial inequalities on the moment and pseudo-moment cones.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Circle Packings with Flexible Radii</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.07165v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circle packings are arrangement of circles satisfying specified tangency requirements. Many problems about packing of circles and spheres occur in nature particularly in material design and protein structure. Surprisingly, little is known about the stability and rigidity of circle packings. In this paper, we study the rigidity of circle packings representing a given planar graph. The radii of circles are flexible with equality and inequality constraints. We provide a dual condition for the packing to be rigid in the first order. This gives us a sufficient condition to show a packing is rigid. Then we will explore the difficulties on rigidity problems beyond the first order.</description>

      <title>Balanced multiple q-zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the balanced multiple q-zeta values. They give a new model for multiple q-zeta values, whose product formula combines the shuffle and stuffle product for multiple zeta values in a natural way. Moreover, the balanced multiple q-zeta values are invariant under a very explicit involution. Thus, all relations among the balanced multiple q-zeta values are conjecturally of a very simple shape. Examples of the balanced multiple q-zeta values are the classical Eisenstein series, and they also contain the combinatorial multiple Eisenstein series. The construction of the balanced multiple q-zeta values is done on the level of generating series. We introduce a general setup relating Hoffman's quasi-shuffle products to explicit symmetries among generating series of words, which gives a clarifying approach to Ecalle's theory of bimoulds. This allows us to obtain an isomorphism between the underlying Hopf algebras of words related to the combinatorial bi-multiple Eisenstein series and the balanced multiple q-zeta values.</description>

      <title>Randomly Punctured Reed-Solomon Codes Achieve the List Decoding Capacity over Polynomial-Size Alphabets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that, with high probability, randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes over fields of polynomial size achieve the list decoding capacity. More specifically, we prove that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $R\in (0,1)$, with high probability, randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes of block length $n$ and rate $R$ are $\left(1-R-\epsilon, O({1}/{\epsilon})\right)$ list decodable over alphabets of size at least $2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)}n^2$. This extends the recent breakthrough of Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam (STOC 2023) that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes over fields of exponential size attain the generalized Singleton bound of Shangguan and Tamo (STOC 2020).</description>

      <title>Topological recursion on transalgebraic spectral curves and Atlantes Hurwitz numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a spectral curve with exponential singularities (which we call a "transalgebraic spectral curve"), we extend the definition of topological recursion to include contributions from the exponential singularities in a way that is compatible with limits of sequences of spectral curves. This allows us to prove the topological recursion/quantum curve correspondence for a large class of transalgebraic spectral curves. As an application, we find that Atlantes Hurwitz numbers, which were previously thought to fall outside the scope of topological recursion, satisfy (our extended version of) topological recursion, and we construct the corresponding quantum curve directly from topological recursion.</description>

      <title>A generalization of formal multiple zeta values related to multiple Eisenstein series and multiple q-zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the $\tau$-invariant balanced quasi-shuffle algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$, whose elements formalize (combinatorial) multiple Eisenstein series as well as multiple q-zeta values. In particular, $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$ has natural maps into these two algebras, and we expect these maps to be isomorphisms. Racinet studied the algebra $\mathcal{Z}^f$ of formal multiple zeta values by examining the corresponding affine scheme DM. Similarly, we present the affine scheme BM corresponding to the algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$. We show that Racinet's affine scheme DM embeds into our affine scheme BM. This leads to a projection from the algebra $\mathcal{G}^{\operatorname{f}}$ onto $\mathcal{Z}^f$. Via the above natural maps, this projection corresponds to extracting the constant terms of multiple Eisenstein series or the limit $q\to1$ of multiple q-zeta values.</description>

      <title>Discrete and Continuous Caching Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a discrete search game called the Multiple Caching Game where the searcher's aim is to find all of a set of $d$ treasures hidden in $n$ locations. Allowed queries are sets of locations of size $k$, and the searcher wins if in all $d$ queries, at least one treasure is hidden in one of the $k$ picked locations. P\'alv\"olgyi showed that the value of the game is at most $\frac{k^d}{\binom{n+d-1}{d}}$, with equality for large enough $n$. We conjecture the exact cases of equality. We also investigate variants of the game and show an example where their values are different, answering a question of P\'alv\"olgyi.
  This game is closely related to a continuous variant, Alpern's Caching Game, based on which we define other continous variants of the multiple caching game and examine their values.</description>

Abstract: We use the equivariant cohomology ring of the permutohedral variety to study matroids and their invariants. Investigating the pushforward of matroid Chern classes defined by A. Berget, C. Eur, H. Spink and D. Tseng to the product space $\mathbb{P}^n \times \mathbb{P}^n$, we establish an equivariant generalization of the Tutte polynomial of a matroid. This was suggested in a survey paper by M.Micha{\l}ek. We discuss how this polynomial encodes properties of the matroid by looking at special evaluations. We further introduce an equivariant generalization of the reduced characteristic polynomial of a matroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mekler's construction is a powerful technique for building purely algebraic structures from combinatorial ones. Its power lies in the fact that it allows various model-theoretic tameness properties of the combinatorial structure to transfer to the algebraic one. In this paper, we push this ideology much further, describing a broad class of properties that transfer through Mekler's construction. This technique subsumes many well-known results and opens avenues for many more.
  As a straightforward application of our methods, we (1) obtain transfer principles for stably embedded pairs of Mekler groups and (2) construct strictly $\mathsf{NFOP}_k$ pure groups for all $k\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;2}$. We also answer a question of Chernikov and Hempel on transfer of burden.</description>

      <title>Random sampling of contingency tables and partitions: Two practical examples of the Burnside process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper gives new, efficient algorithms for approximate uniform sampling of contingency tables and integer partitions. The algorithms use the Burnside process, a general algorithm for sampling a uniform orbit of a finite group acting on a finite set. We show that a technique called `lumping' can be used to derive efficient implementations of the Burnside process. For both contingency tables and partitions, the lumped processes have far lower per step complexity than the original Markov chains. We also define a second Markov chain for partitions called the reflected Burnside process. The reflected Burnside process maintains the computational advantages of the lumped process but empirically converges to the uniform distribution much more rapidly. By using the reflected Burnside process we can easily sample uniform partitions of size $10^{10}$.</description>

Abstract: For any two partitions $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a positive integer $N$, let $\chi_{\lambda}(\mu)$ be the value of the irreducible character of the symmetric group $S_{N}$ associated with $\lambda$, evaluated at the conjugacy class of elements whose cycle type is determined by $\mu$. Let $Z(N)$ be the number of zeros in the character table of $S_N$, and $Z_{t}(N)$ be defined as
  $$
  Z_{t}(N):= \#\{(\lambda,\mu): \chi_{\lambda}(\mu) = 0 \; \text{with $\lambda$ a $t$-core}\}.
  $$
  We prove
  $$

      <title>Algebraic Limits of Sandpiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper contributes to building algebraic foundations of self-organized criticality answering a previously unsolved question about the limiting structure of the extended sandpile group as well as relating it to another limit at the level of classical sandpile groups with respect to certain monomorphisms, and puts forward a concept of canonical sandpile epimorphisms, drawing an unexpected consequence about the divisibility properties of the numbers of spanning trees on rectangles.</description>

      <title>Hodge-Riemann polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16992v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Schur classes of ample vector bundles on smooth projective varieties satisfy Hodge-Riemann relations on $H^{p,q}$ under the assumption that $H^{p-2,q-2}$ vanishes. More generally, we study Hodge-Riemann polynomials, which are partially symmetric polynomials that produce cohomology classes satisfying the Hodge-Riemann property when evaluated at Chern roots of ample vector bundles. In the case of line bundles and in bidegree $(1,1)$, these are precisely the nonzero dually Lorentzian polynomials. We prove various properties of Hodge-Riemann polynomials, confirming predictions and answering questions of Ross and Toma. As an application, we show that the derivative sequence of any product of Schur polynomials is Schur log-concave, confirming conjectures of Ross and Wu.</description>

      <title>Quivers with Polynomial Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a topological characterization of quivers whose path algebra satisfies a polynomial identity. This class includes the oriented cycle and acyclic quivers and, in the latter case, we describe the associated T-ideal. We introduce a generalization of Arnold's A-graded algebras, which we call locally A-graded algebras, and prove that they are also PI. We give an example of a quiver algebra satisfying a polynomial identity, even if the path algebra of the quiver does not.</description>

      <title>Singular values of sparse random rectangular matrices: Emergence of outliers at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the random bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n, m, p)$, where each edge with one vertex in $V_{1}=[n]$ and the other vertex in $V_{2} =[m]$ is connected with probability $p$, and $n=\lfloor \gamma m\rfloor$ for a constant aspect ratio $\gamma \geq 1$. It is well known that the empirical spectral measure of its centered and normalized adjacency matrix converges to the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur (MP) distribution. However, largest and smallest singular values may not converge to the right and left edges, respectively, especially when $p = o(1)$. Notably, it was proved by Dumitriu and Zhu (2024) that there are almost surely no singular value outside the compact support of the MP law when $np = \omega(\log(n))$. In this paper, we consider the critical sparsity regime where $p = b\log(n)/\sqrt{mn}$ for some constant $b&gt;0$. We quantitatively characterize the emergence of outlier singular values as follows. For explicit $b_{*}$ and $b^{*}$ as functions of $\gamma$, we prove that when $b &gt; b_{*}$, there is no outlier outside the bulk; when $b^{*}&lt; b &lt; b_{*}$, outliers are present only outside the right edge of the MP law; and when $b &lt; b^{*}$, outliers are present on both sides, all with high probability. Moreover, the locations of those outliers are precisely characterized by a function depending on the largest and smallest degree vertices of the random graph. We estimate the number of outliers as well. Our results follow the path forged by Alt, Ducatez and Knowles (2021), and can be extended to sparse random rectangular matrices with bounded entries.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and Dynamical Systems of Dickson Polynomials in Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical properties of Dickson polynomials over finite fields, focusing on the periodicity and structural behavior of their iterated sequences. We introduce and analyze the sequence $[D_n(x, \alpha) \mod (x^q - x)]_n$, where $D_n(x, \alpha)$ denotes a Dickson polynomial of the first kind, and explore its periodic nature when reduced modulo $x^q - x$. We derive explicit formulas for the period of these sequences, particularly in the case when $n$ is coprime to $q^2 - 1$. In addition, we identify a symmetric property of the polynomial coefficients that plays a crucial role in the analysis of these sequences. Using tools from combinatorics, elementary number theory, and finite fields, we present algorithms to compute the exact period and investigate the dynamical structure of these polynomials. We also highlight open problems in cases where the degree $n$ is not coprime to $q^2 - 1$. Our results offer deep insights into the algebraic structure of Dickson polynomials and their role in dynamical systems over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Polynomial properties of unipotent radicals of parabolic subgroups in classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R_u^{X,d}$ denote the unipotent radical of a (proper) maximal standard parabolic subgroup of the classical group $\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(q)$, $\mathrm{SO}_{2n}(q)$, or $\mathrm U_{2n}({q^2})$. This paper establishes explicit formulas for the number of irreducible characters of $R_u^{X,d}$ with degree $q^e$.</description>
