      <title>Design and Fabrication Of Multiplexed One-Port SAW Resonators On A Single Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) sensors are considered as a viable option for label-free, sensitive, real-time, and cost-effective detection. In this paper, we present the design, the fabrication and the characterization of multiplexed SAW sensors based on a single chip SAW resonator. Operating near the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands, resonators were microfabricated on 42.75{\textdegree} Y (ST) cut Quartz. This substrate was selected due to its traditional association with temperature stability in the design of SAW devices. Parameters like aperture, number of interdigitated electrode (IDT) pairs, IDT wavelengths, and number of reflectors were studied experimentally to enhance electrical responses. Resonance frequency, quality factor and electromechanical coupling were extracted through impedance measurements and fitted with a modified Butterworth-Van Dyke (MBVD) model. Based on these results, we propose a novel design for a multi-frequency device that can serve as a single electronic nose for complex gases detection.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of neutron-$\gamma$ in the low energy regime using machine learning for an EJ-276D plastic scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present results for discrimination of neutron and $\gamma$ events using a plastic scintillator detector with pulse shape discrimination capabilities. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to improve the discriminatory power between neutron and $\gamma$ events at lower energy ranges which otherwise are not addressed by the conventional pulse shape discrimination techniques. The use of a multilayer perceptron with Bayesian inference (MLPBNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are studied using the recorded waveforms from the detector. Three variables are constructed for the input of ML algorithms, which captures the essence of the differences in the head and tail part of the neutron and $\gamma$ waveforms. The training and the testing of the ML algorithms are done using an AmBe neutron source. In the lower energy region, the results obtained from the ML predictions are compared with the results obtained from a time of flight (ToF) technique to benchmark the overall performance of the ML algorithms. A reasonable agreement is observed between the results obtained from ML algorithm and the ToF experiment in the studied energy range. The MLPBNN gives better discriminatory power for the neutron and $\gamma$ events than the SVM algorithm.</description>

      <title>Study of neutron response using time of flight technique in ISMRAN detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the measurements of the fast neutron energy response in Indian Scintillator Matrix for Reactor Anti-Neutrinos (ISMRAN) detector consisting of an array of 9$\times$10 Plastic Scintillator Bars (PSBs) at BARC, Mumbai. ISMRAN is an above ground detector setup at $\sim$13 m from the Dhruva reactor core for the detection of reactor anti-neutrinos (${\overline{\ensuremath{\nu}}}_{e}$) via the inverse beta decay (IBD) process. The dominant sources of reactor-related background in the vicinity of the detector are high energy $\gamma$-rays and fast neutrons. Therefore, a good understanding of fast neutron response in PSB is an essential pre-requisite for suppression and discrimination of the fast neutron background from IBD events. Kinetic energies of the fast neutron were determined using the Time-of-Flight (TOF) technique, which is used to get the scintillation light yield due to recoiling proton in PSB. We also measured the fast neutron capture time distribution in ISMRAN array using a novel technique involving TOF of the measured fast neutrons. The observed characteristic neutron capture time ( $\tau$ ) of 68.29 $\pm$ 9.48 $\mu$s is in good agreement with GEANT4 based MC simulation. These experimentally measured results will be useful for discriminating correlated and uncorrelated (accidental) background events from the true IBD events in reactor ON and OFF conditions inside the reactor hall.</description>

      <title>Using krypton-83m to determine the neutrino-mass bias caused by a non-constant electric potential of the KATRIN source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision spectroscopy of the electron spectrum of the tritium $\beta$ decay near the kinematic endpoint is a direct method to determine the effective electron antineutrino mass. The KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment aims to determine this quantity with a sensitivity of better than $0.3\,\mathrm{eV}$ ($90\,\%$~C.L.). An inhomogeneous electric potential in the tritium source of KATRIN leads to a distortion of the $\beta$ spectrum, which directly impacts the neutrino-mass observable. This effect can be quantified through precision spectroscopy of the conversion electrons of co-circulated metastable $^{83\mathrm{m}}Kr$. This work perturbatively describes the effect of the source potential on the recorded spectra, and thus establishes the leading-order observables of this effect.</description>

      <title>A New cw-NMR Q-meter for Dynamically Polarized Targets for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized solid targets produced via Dynamic Nuclear Polarization rely on Continuous-Wave Nuclear Magnetism Resonance measurements to accurately determine the degree of polarization of bulk samples polarized to nearly 100%. Since the late 1970's phase sensitive detection methods have been utilized to observe the magnetization of a sample as a small change in inductance under RF excitation near the Larmor frequency of the nuclear species of interest, using a device known as a Q-meter. Liverpool Q-meters, produced in the UK in the 80's and 90's, have been the workhorse devices for these targets for decades, however their age and scarcity has meant new systems are needed. We describe a Q-meter system designed and built at Jefferson Lab in the Liverpool style to have comparable electronic performance with several improvements to update and adapt the devices for modern use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed study of the particle identification by the Focusing Aerogel Ring Imaging CHerenkov subsystem at the future charm superfactory detector is presented. The dedicated signal ring reconstruction algorithm is implemented in the detector simulation, the algorithm performance is tested with single particles generated within the Aurora framework. Two Boosted Decision Trees-based classifiers for the particle identification have been developed for various assumptions about photosensor noise levels. The approach is validated with the analysis of the D0-&gt;Kmunu decays, for which the systematic uncertainty and background contribution related to the pion/muon separation performance can be minimised due to high efficiency of the particle identification algorithm.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Benchtop Magnetophotometer (MAP) for Characterizing the Magnetic Susceptibility of Suspended Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) form the foundation of many technologies, frequently serving to purify proteins or cells from a biological sample or to remove environmental contaminants. Their success relies on their magnetic response, which allows them to be easily controlled in a liquid or solution. Therefore, the magnetic susceptibility provides one metric for assessing the suitability of a MNP for a given application. Unfortunately, conventional methods for measuring the magnetic susceptibility relies on instrumentation that characterizes the MNPs as a dry powder. Because MNPs are typically used in suspension, the measured value may be different from their behavior in suspension, thus providing inaccurate readings. Here, we present the design and validation of a magnetophotometer (MAP), an instrument that characterizes the effective magnetic susceptibility of suspended MNPs via differential optical spectroscopy, providing a more relevant measure of MNPs' magnetic properties. As part of this work, we developed a mathematical model to calculate the effective magnetic susceptibility from the MAP data and validated the model using control measurements with iron oxide nanoparticles. Finally, we demonstrate that MAP testing is non-destructive by successfully characterizing bioconjugated particles without damaging the bioactivity of the surface bioconjugation, providing a path for in-line quality control assessment.</description>

      <title>A deconvolution based signal reconstruction capable of piled-up pulse separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides a computationally effective deconvolution algorithm capable to reconstruct piled-up events in scintillating detector systems with high count rate where fully digitized waveforms are available. A fixed-point iteration algorithm is suggested and used to find properties of the signals which are later used during the signal preprocessing stage. The impulse response function is successfully extracted even from heavily piled-up event waveforms using an iterative approach. A methodology for pulse time and amplitude reconstruction is based on a deconvolution algorithm, which is described in details and some results are presented. The presented algorithms are meant to be general and might be successfully applied to other fields with minor to no modifications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Active Seismic Isolation Systems in Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors such as KAGRA, a 3-km long underground laser interferometer in Japan, require elaborate passive and active seismic isolation of their mirrors. With the aim of detecting passing gravitational waves that create a relative mirror displacement of less than $10^{-22}\ \mathrm{m}$ at frequencies of tens to hundreds of Hz, all environmental couplings must be stringently suppressed. This paper presents the result of applying the H-infinity optimization method to the active seismic isolation of a gravitational-wave detector for the first time. The so-called \textit{sensor correction} and \textit{sensor fusion} schemes of the seismic attenuation system of KAGRA's signal recycling mirror are used as a test bed. We designed and implemented optimal sensor correction and sensor fusion filters, resulting in a sevenfold attenuation of seismic noise coupling to the signal recycling mirror in the 0.1-0.5 Hz band, with the downstream effect of an 88.2% noise performance improvement in the same frequency band. When combined with other hardware upgrades, the implementation of sensor correction and sensor fusion contributed to an increase in KAGRA's duty cycle from 53% in the O3GK observation run to 80% in O4a, demonstrating the effectiveness of the H-infinity optimization approach.</description>

Abstract: Micro-objects levitated in a vacuum are an exciting platform for precision sensing due to their low dissipation motion and the potential for control at the quantum level. Arrays of such sensors would offer increased sensitivity, directionality, and in the quantum regime the potential to exploit correlation and entanglement. We use neuromorphic detection via a single event based camera to record the motion of an array of levitated microspheres. We present a scalable method for arbitrary multiparticle tracking and control by implementing real-time feedback to cool the motion of three objects simultaneously, the first demonstration of neuromorphic sensing for real-time control at the microscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of an Omnivision OV5647 CMOS image sensor (5 Mp) for detecting radiation from Sr90 and Cs137 sources. Our experimental setup uses a Raspberry Pi 3 mini-computer for data acquisition, with image processing using Python and OpenCV libraries. We specify the necessary settings to convert a standard camera into a particle detector sensitive to electrons and photons, including a two-step background filtering procedure. In addition, we implement the first detailed Geant4 simulation that describes the layered geometry and material composition of a commercial CMOS sensor along with the radioactive sources. To enhance the simulation, we include an algorithm for charge diffusion and conversion of the energy deposited by electrons and photons into ADC counts. Our measurements are presented in terms of cluster size, the maximum ADC signal per cluster, and the number of clusters as a function of distance. We find a good agreement between the experimental data and simulation for all these observables, and we can reproduce the correlation between cluster size and maximum ADC signal per cluster. Thus, this simulation, cross-checked with data, can be used to test the feasibility of further particle detection ideas without the need to implement an experimental setup. However, the sensor has limited primary energy resolution and is thus unable to distinguish between different radioactive sources. Nevertheless, given the accurate measurement of energy deposition, the sensor, once calibrated, is suitable for dosimetric measurements of source activities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterodyne detection using microwave cavities is a promising method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves or ultralight axion dark matter. In this work, we report on studies conducted on a spherical 2-cell cavity developed by the MAGO collaboration for high-frequency gravitational waves detection. Although fabricated around 20 years ago, the cavity had not been used since. Due to deviations from the nominal geometry, we conducted a mechanical survey and performed room-temperature plastic tuning. Measurements and simulations of the mechanical resonances and electromagnetic properties were carried out, as these are critical for estimating the cavity's gravitational wave coupling potential. Based on these results, we plan further studies in a cryogenic environment. The cavity characterisation does not only provide valuable experience for a planned physics run but also informs the future development of improved cavity designs.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled Rydberg atomic polarimetry of radio-frequency fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of atomic angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the complementary absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic gases for quantum metrological electric field characterization. In particular, it calls into question prevailing interpretations of SI-traceable Rydberg atom electrometers.</description>

Abstract: Mining $^3{\rm He}$ from lunar regolith has attracted significant interest in recent years due to the scarcity of $^3{\rm He}$ on Earth and its diverse applications, from cryogenics and medical imaging, to nuclear physics and future nuclear fusion. Given the stringent technical and economic challenges of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$, precise prospecting is essential. Here we propose a prospecting methodology based on a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer, which can detect the dipolar magnetic field of thermally polarized $^3{\rm He}$ spins. With a 200 g regolith sample and an rf-magnetometer with sensitivity $1~{\rm fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ we can detect $^3{\rm He}$ with abundance 5 ppb within a measurement time of just 5 min. The associated apparatus is lightweight and significantly more cost-effective than alternative measurement techniques. The proposed prospecting method is readily deployable and could substantially improve the technical and economic feasibility of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$.</description>
