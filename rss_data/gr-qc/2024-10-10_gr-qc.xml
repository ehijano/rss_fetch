      <title>A novel approach to baryogenesis in $f(Q,L_{m})$ gravity and its cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an examination of the $f(Q,L_{m})$ gravity model, in which the functional form $f(Q,L_{m})=\alpha Q^{n}+\beta L_{m}$ is postulated and discuss its potential impact on cosmological dynamics and the phenomenon of gravitational baryogenesis. Combining observational insights from Hubble, BAO and phantom datasets, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to constrain the model's parameters and determine the baryon-to-entropy ratio $\frac{\eta_{B}}{s}$, providing valuable insights into the model's performance and cosmological implications. In the context of baryogenesis and generalized gravitational baryogenesis, we show that setting $n=\frac{1}{2}$ results in a zero baryon-to-entropy ratio, which is physically implausible. Through a detailed examination of the dependence of $\frac{\eta_{B}}{s}$ on $n$ and $\beta$, we demonstrate that our model predicts a baryon-to-entropy ratio that is both positive and consistent with the observational upper limit of $9.42\times10^{-11}$ for $1.32965&lt;n&lt;1.39252$ and appropriate of $\beta$ and $n$ with $\alpha\simeq-1.95084\times10^{86}$. The excellent agreement between our model's predictions and the phantom dataset demonstrates the model's capacity to accurately describe the physics of baryogenesis and its ability to reproduce the observed features of the cosmological data, showcasing its potential as a reliable tool for understanding the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Influence of GUP corrected Casimir energy on zero tidal force wormholes in modified teleparallel gravity with matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, the study of the Casimir effect in quantum field theory has garnered increasing attention because of its potential to be an ideal source of exotic matter needed for stabilizing traversable wormholes. It has been confirmed through experimental evidence that this phenomenon involves fluctuations in the vacuum field, leading to a negative energy density. Motivated by the above, we have investigated Casimir wormholes with corrections from the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) within the framework of matter-coupled teleparallel gravity. Our analysis includes three well-known GUP models: the Kempf, Mangano, and Mann (KMM) model, the Detournay, Gabriel, and Spindel (DGS) model, and a third model called Model II. For a broader analysis, we have considered two well-known model functions for the teleparallel theory: a linear $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha T+\beta\mathcal{T}$ and a quadratic model $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\eta T^2+\chi\mathcal{T}$. The shape function solutions corresponding to both models are examined in the absence of tidal forces in spacetime. We also demonstrate the crucial role played by the parameters of the $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ models in the violation of the energy conditions. With the increasing interest in detecting gravitational waves from astrophysical objects, we have thoroughly discussed the perturbation of the wormhole solutions in the scalar, electromagnetic, axial gravitational, and Dirac field backgrounds. We employ the $3^{rd}$ order WKB expansion to find the complex frequencies associated with the quasinormal modes of energy dissipation. Additionally, we also calculate the active mass and total gravitational energy for the wormhole geometry. The amount of exotic matter involved in sustaining these wormholes is also found in this paper. Furthermore, the physical stability of such Casimir wormholes is examined using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation.</description>

      <title>Direct current memory effects in effective-one-body waveform models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct current (DC) memory is a non-oscillatory, hereditary component of the gravitational wave (GW) signal that represents one of the most peculiar manifestations of the nonlinear nature of GW emission and propagation. In this work, by transforming the results provided in Ebersold et al. [Phys.Rev.D 100 (2019) 8, 084043] in harmonic coordinates and quasi-Keplerian parametrization, we provide the DC memory in terms of the effective-one-body (EOB) phase-space variables, with a relative accuracy of 2.5PN and in an expansion for small eccentricity up to order six. Our results are then implemented in TEOBResumS-Dal\'i, thus providing the first EOB model with DC memory contributions. This model is then used to assess the impact on the waveform and the main features of the DC memory, also addressing its dependence on the eccentricity of the binary system at its formation.</description>

      <title>Hypershadows of higher dimensional black objects: a case study of cohomogeneity-one d=5 Myers-Perry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What does a black hole look like? In 1+3 spacetime dimensions, the optical appearance of a black hole is a bidimensional region in the observer's sky often called the black hole shadow, as supported by the EHT observations. In higher dimensions this question is more subtle and observational setup dependent. Previous studies considered the shadows of higher dimensional black holes to remain bidimensional. We argue that the latter should be regarded as a tomography of a higher dimensional structure, the hypershadow, which would be the structure "seen" by higher dimensional observers. As a case study we consider the cohomogeneity-one Myers-Perry black hole in 1+4 dimensions, and compute its tridimensional hypershadow.</description>

      <title>Investigating Rotating Black Holes in Bumblebee Gravity: Insights from EHT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EHT observation revealed event horizon-scale images of the supermassive black holes Sgr A* and M87* and these results are consistent with the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. However, Kerr-like rotating black holes in modified gravity theories can not ruled out, as they provide a crucial testing ground for these theories through EHT observations. It motivates us to investigate the Bumblebee theory, a vector-tensor extension of the Einstein-Maxwell theory that permits spontaneous symmetry breaking, resulting in the field acquiring a vacuum expectation value and introducing Lorentz violation. We present rotating black holes within this bumblebee gravity model, which includes an additional parameter $\ell$ alongside the mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$ - namely RBHBG. Unlike the Kerr black hole, an extremal RBHBG, for $\ell&lt;0$, refers to a black hole with angular momentum $a&gt;M$. We derive an analytical formula necessary for the shadow of our rotating black holes, then visualize them with varying parameters $a$ and $\ell$, and also estimate the black hole parameters using shadow observables viz. shadow radius $R_s$, distortion $\delta_s$, shadow area $A$ and oblateness $D$ using two well-known techniques. We find that $\ell$ incrementally increases the shadow size and causes more significant deformation while decreasing the event horizon area. Remarkably, an increase in $\ell$ enlarges the shadow radius irrespective of spin or inclination angle $\theta_0$.</description>

      <title>Galaxy rotation curve in hyperconical universes: a natural relativistic MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and similar proposals can (at least partially) explain the excess rotation of galaxies or the equivalent mass-discrepancy acceleration, without (or by reducing) the requirement of dark matter halos. This paper develops a modified gravity model to obtain a local limit to general relativity (GR) compatible with a cosmological metric different from the standard Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker metric. Specifically, the paper uses a distorted stereographic projection of hyperconical universes, which are 4D hypersurfaces embedded into 5D Minkowski spacetime. This embedding is a key in the MOND effects found in galactic scales. To adequately describe the mass-discrepancy acceleration relation, the centrifugal force would present a small time-like contribution at large-scale dynamics due to the curvature of the Universe. Therefore, the Lagrangian density is very similar to GR but with subtracting the background curvature (or vacuum energy density) of the perturbed hyperconical metric. Results showed that the proposed model adjusts well to 123 galaxy rotation curves obtained from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves database, using only a free parameter.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity Reduction for Quasicircular Binary Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of quasicircular compact binaries is a major goal in numerical relativity, as they are expected to constitute most gravitational wave observations. However, given that orbital eccentricity is not well-defined in general relativity, providing initial data for such binaries is a challenge for numerical simulations. Most numerical relativity codes obtain initial conditions for low-eccentricity binary simulations by iterating over a sequence of short simulations -- measuring eccentricity mid-evolution and correcting the initial data parameters accordingly. Eccentricity measurement depends on a numerically challenging nonlinear fit to an estimator model, and the resulting eccentricity estimate is extremely sensitive to small changes in how the fit is performed. We have developed an improved algorithm that produces more consistent measurements of eccentricity relative to the time window chosen for fitting. The primary innovations are the use of the nonlinear optimization algorithm, variable projection, in place of more conventional routines, an initial fit parameter guess taken from the trajectory frequency spectrum, and additional frequency processing of the trajectory data prior to fitting.</description>

      <title>A novel stacked hybrid autoencoder for imputing LISA data gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will contain gaps with missing or unusable data due to antenna repointing, orbital corrections, instrument malfunctions, and unknown random processes. We introduce a new deep learning model to impute data gaps in the LISA data stream. The stacked hybrid autoencoder combines a denoising convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) with a bi-directional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). The DCAE is used to extract relevant features in the corrupted data, while the BiGRU captures the temporal dynamics of the gravitational-wave signals. We show for a massive black hole binary signal, corrupted by data gaps of various numbers and duration, that we yield an overlap of greater than 99.97% when the gaps do not occur in the merging phase and greater than 99% when the gaps do occur in the merging phase. However, if data gaps occur during merger time, we show that we get biased astrophysical parameter estimates, highlighting the need for "protected periods," where antenna repointing does not occur during the predicted merger time.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analyzing Stability of Hybrid Stars within $f(Q)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05616v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses the Krori-Barua type metric to represent hybrid stars within the $f(Q)$ theory of gravity. We postulate that the hybrid star also contains strange quark matter in addition to regular baryonic matter. To investigate the physical viability of the hybrid star model, we present the graphical behavior of the energy density, radial pressure, and tangential pressure, equation of state parameters, anisotropy, and stability analysis, respectively, by choosing the compact star EXO 1785-248 with a mass of $1.3_{-0.2}^{+0.2}~M_{\odot}$ and radius $8.849_{-0.4}^{+0.4}$ km with five different values of the coupling constants as $a=2$, $a=4$, $a=6$, $a=8$, and $a=10$. The maximum allowed masses and corresponding radii have been calculated using the $M-R$ curve for three different coupling parameter '$a$' values which match the observational data of three distinct compact stars, namely LMC X-4, SMC X-1, and 4U 1538-52. So, the $f(Q)$ theory of gravity can provide results that are plausible for describing the macroscopical characteristics of hybrid star candidates.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of black holes in five-dimensional gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the topological properties of five-dimensional rotating charged black holes in different ensembles.The topological numbers for the black holes are gotten in the grand canonical and canonical ensembles, which are 1. When the charge and cosmological constant disappear, their topological numbers are 0. When the pressure is lower than the critical pressure, the phase transition exists in the canonical ensemble. However, the phase transition also exists in the grand canonical ensemble when the pressure is higher than the critical pressure and two independent rotational parameters are $a=1$ and $b=-1$. This may be due to the fact that the values of the rotational parameters change the supersymmetry of the black hole and lead to the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Charged gravastar model in noncommutative geometry under $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the properties of charged gravastars in torsion-based $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity in the presence of noncommutative geometry. We have taken the interior from noncommutative motivated space-time, noting that why, from a physical point of view, such a choice is justified, then we have taken the thin shell as stiff matter and taken three different exterior metrics (Reissner-Nordstrom (R-N), Bardeen and Ayon-Beato-Garcia (ABG) metric) to construct the gravastar model. We have studied the physical properties like proper length, entropy, energy, and EoS for these models, and we have also used Israel junction conditions to study the effective pressure, energy density, and potential of the thin shell. Finally, we comment on the stability of such a thin shell and the deflection angle caused by such a thin shell, which could, in principle, be tested by future radio telescopes like the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05693v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we explore the $f(Q,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu})$ gravity theory, building upon the foundations laid by the $f(Q)$ and $f(Q,T)$ gravity theories. Here, $Q$ represents non-metricity and $T_{\mu\nu}$ stands for the energy-momentum tensor. The proposed action encompasses an arbitrary function of both non-metricity $Q$ and the square of the energy-momentum tensor, specifically $T^2=T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu}$. We find the analytical solution for the barotropic fluid case $p=\omega \rho$ for the model $f(Q, T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) = Q + \eta(T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) $. We constrain parameters of the solution $H(z)$ utilizing CC, BAO, and latest Pantheon+SH0ES samples with the help of Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling technique along with Bayesian statistical analysis. Further, from the Om diagnostic test, we find that the assumed cosmological model favors the quintessence regime.</description>

      <title>Spinning particles near Kerr black holes: Orbits and gravitational-wave fluxes through the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are among the key sources of gravitational waves for the LISA space-based gravitational wave detector. Achieving sufficient accuracy in the gravitational wave template for these binaries requires modeling the effects of the spin of the comparably light secondary compact object. In this work, we employ the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the motion of spinning bodies in Kerr space-time to obtain their generic orbits. Then, using the Teukolsky formalism we compute gravitational wave energy and angular momentum fluxes sourced by these orbits valid to linear order in secondary spin, and provide waveform snapshots corresponding to the motion. The solver we have developed substantially improves on previous studies in terms of speed and accuracy, and includes the case of a fully precessing secondary spin. As such, it provides a significant building block for the modelling of waveforms of precessing compact binaries at large mass ratios.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Multicomponent Dark Energy Model and the Possibility of EDE like behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamics and phase-space behavior of a multicomponent dark energy model, where the dark sector consists of a minimally coupled canonical scalar field and the cosmological constant, using a dynamical system analysis setup for various types of potentials for which a general parameterisation of the scalar field potentials has been considered. Several fixed points with different cosmological behaviours have been identified. A detailed stability analysis has been done and possible late-time attractors have been found. For this multi-component dark energy model, the late-time attractors are either fully dominated by the cosmological constant or represent a scenario where a combination of the scalar field and the cosmological constant dominates the universe. We have also shown that for this type of model, the scalar field can show early dark energy (EDE) like behaviour. However, our analysis indicates that this EDE like behaviour occurs naturally deep in the matter-dominated era, not before the recombination era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the massless scalar field perturbations, focusing on the quasinormal modes spectrum and the ringdown waveform of regular black hole spacetimes derived within the Asymptotic Safety program. In particular, we discuss the stability of a new class of AS black holes recently derived dynamically within a non-singular model of collapse and explore the possibility of detecting signatures of the horizon structure with high-order overtones.</description>

      <title>Dust collapse and horizon formation in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic Gravity supplements the Einstein-Hilbert action by terms quadratic in the spacetime curvature. This leads to a rich phase space of static, compact gravitating objects including the Schwarzschild black hole, wormholes, and naked singularities. For the first time, we study the collapse of a spherically symmetric star with uniform dust density in this setting. The symmetries of the problem make the interior solution insensitive to the Weyl-squared term, so that the interior dynamics is fully determined by $R$ and $R^2$. As our main result, we find that the collapse leads to the formation of a horizon, implying that the endpoint of a uniform dust collapse in Quadratic Gravity is not a horizonless spacetime. We also show that the curvature-squared contribution is responsible for making the collapse into a singularity faster than the standard Oppenheimer-Snyder scenario. Furthermore, the junction conditions connecting spacetime inside and outside the matter distribution are found to be significantly more constraining than their counterparts in General Relativity and we discuss key properties of any exterior solution matching to the spacetime inside the collapsing star.</description>

      <title>A Unified Spectral Approach for Quasinormal Modes of Morris-Thorne Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive examination of quasinormal modes (QNMs) linked to Morris-Thorne, also known as Bronnikov-Ellis wormholes, delving into scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations using the spectral method. Our research corrects inaccuracies previously reported in the literature and addresses areas where the Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB) approximation proves inadequate. Moreover, we introduce and evaluate a novel spectral technique designed to consolidate recent advancements in formulating QNM boundary conditions at both the wormhole throat and space-like infinity. This innovative approach bridges critical gaps in existing methodologies and enhances the accuracy and applicability of QNM analysis in the study of wormhole physics.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Stellar Models with Tolman IV Spacetime in Non-minimally Coupled Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to investigate various anisotropic stellar models in the background of $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{Q})$ gravity, where $\mathcal{Q}=\mathcal{R}_{\varphi\vartheta}\mathcal{T}^{\varphi\vartheta}$. In this regard, we adopt two standard models as $\mathcal{R}+\zeta\mathcal{Q}$ and $\mathcal{R}+\zeta\mathcal{R}\mathcal{Q}$, where $\zeta$ symbolizes an arbitrary coupling parameter. We take spherical interior geometry and find solution to the modified gravitational field equations corresponding to each model by employing the `Tolman IV' spacetime. We need an additional constraint to close the system of field equations, thus the $\mathbb{MIT}$ bag model equation of state is chosen. The effects of modified theory on physical properties of six compact stars like PSR J 1614 2230,~SMC X-1,~Cen X-3,~PSR J 1903+327,~SAX J 1808.4-3658 and 4U 1820-30 are analyzed by using their respective masses and radii. We also determine the values of three unknowns involving in Tolman IV solution as well as the bag constant for each star at the hypersurface. Furthermore, various characteristics of the resulting solutions are examined through graphical interpretation for $\zeta=\pm5$. Finally, we explore the stability of the compact objects through two different approaches. We conclude that our model-I produces physically acceptable structures corresponding to each star candidate for both values of $\zeta$ whereas model-II is stable only for $\zeta=5$.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the back-reaction debate, and~some unexplained characteristics of the CMB, we investigate the possibility of some anisotropy in the universe observed around us. To this aim, we build up a novel prediction for the Hubble law for the late universe from a Bianchi type I model, {taken as proof of concept,}
  transcribing the departure of such model from a $\Lambda$CDM model. We~dicussed the redshift measurement in this universe, and~finally formalized the Hubble diagram.</description>

      <title>Probing Interacting Dark Sector with the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have probed the capability of third-generation Gravitational Waves (GW) interferometers, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, to constrain a cosmological model with an interacting dark sector. We focused on GW events with a detected electromagnetic counterpart being the $\gamma$ or X emission of Gamma-Ray Burst, and a Kilonova emission. We assume the first one to be detected by the THESEUS satellite, while the second one to be detected by the Vera Rubin Observatory. We probed three different interaction kernels and found that the posterior estimation of the cosmological parameters is biased due to the existing degeneracies between the dark and matter sectors. We also found that introducing an external prior on the matter density parameter breaks the degeneracy, removes the bias results, and improves the accuracy on the dark sector parameters.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Modified Chaplygin Jacobi And Modified Chaplygin Abel Gas: Stability Analysis and Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the thermodynamic properties and stability of two newly introduced gas models, namely the Modified Chaplygin Jacobi gas and the Modified Chaplygin Abel gas. To achieve this, we examine the behavior of relevant physical parameters to gain in depth information about the evolution of the universe. The specific heat formalism is employed to verify the applicability of the third law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, the equation of state for the thermal system is obtained by applying thermodynamic variables. The stability of the gas models is investigated within the framework of classical thermodynamics, focusing on adiabatic processes, specific heat capacities, and isothermal conditions. It is inferred that the proposed fluid configurations exhibit thermodynamic stability and undergo adiabatic expansion for suitable parameter choices. We then perform observational analysis using CC+BAO and Pantheon+SH0ES datasets to impose constraints on our model parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process.</description>

      <title>A way of decoupling the gravitational bulk field equations of braneworld black holes to suppress the bulk singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a methodology for decoupling the bulk gravitational field equations of braneworld black holes to suppress the bulk singularities. To achieve this, we apply a linear Minimal Geometric Deformation (MGD) with respect to a coupling constant \( \alpha \) to the $4D$ Minkowski spacetime embedded in an extra dimension. This results in a gravitational decoupling into a system \( \mathcal{A} \) with equations of motion of order \( \alpha^0 \) and a system \( \mathcal{B} \), related to the so-called Quasi-Einstein equations of order \( \alpha \). This methodology allows for the construction of a regular geometry everywhere. We outline the necessary constraints for eliminating singularities and provide a recipe for solving the equations of motion. Both the warp factor, the scalar field, and the potential obtained are smooth and free from Dirac delta singularities. A control parameter is introduced such that, in the limit \( b \to 0 \), the Randall-Sundrum (RS) setup is recovered, resulting in a transition from a thick brane to a thin brane. The asymptotic behavior of the curvature invariant \( \displaystyle \lim_{y \to \pm \infty} R_{5D}(r,y) \) is positive near the de Sitter core (for small \( r \)), asymptotically negative for finite \( r &gt; r_* \), and asymptotically flat at the $4D$ boundary as \( r \to \infty \). Although this work aims to suppress bulk singularities, it is expected that our methodology may be useful for future investigations related to the embedding of gravitational objects within other braneworld contexts.</description>

      <title>DeepClean: Non-Linear Regression for Noise Reduction in the Virgo Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06220v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves (GW) in 2015, there have been significant efforts to enhance the sensitivity of the ground-based detectors within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Despite these efforts, many gravitational wave signals remain below the detection threshold due to non-linear noise from the physical environment of the detectors, coupled with the main GW signal.
  \texttt{DeepClean}'s capability to handle a variety of noise sources, including linear, non-linear, and \emph{non-stationary} coupling mechanisms, is particularly important in fields like astrophysics and gravitational wave astronomy, where accurate data analysis is crucial for the detection and study of gravitational waves from astronomical events.</description>

      <title>Constraints on polynomial inflation under power-law perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate perturbations in power-law monomial potentials within inflationary models driven by a single scalar field. By introducing a second term to the original potential, we study how this perturbation influences the slow-roll parameters and analyze the consequent changes in the spectral index, $n_s$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, treating the additional term as a correction to the monomial case. Comparing our numerical results with current cosmological data from the Planck satellite observations on $n_s$, $r$, and the clustering parameter, $\sigma_8$, we place significant constraints on the free parameter of our class of inflationary potentials. We found that the perturbative consistency method we analyze could be an interesting test to explore for more complex inflationary models, looking for features that better match the data that might highlight fundamental physics implications.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases in parametrized tests of general relativity due to waveform mismodeling: the impact of neglecting spin precession and higher modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the robustness of parametrized tests of General Relativity (GR) with gravitational waves due to waveform inaccuracy. In particular, we determine the properties of the signal (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and source parameters) such that we are led to falsely identify a GR deviation due to neglecting spin precession or higher models in the recovery model. To characterize the statistical significance of the biases, we compute the Bayes factor between the non-GR and GR models, and the fitting factor of the non-GR model. For highly-precessing, edge-on signals, we find that mismodeling the signal leads to a significant systematic bias in the recovery of the non-GR parameter, even at an SNR of 30. However, these biased inferences are characterized by a significant loss of SNR and a weak preference for the non-GR model (over the GR model). At a higher SNR, the biased inferences display a strong preference for the non-GR model (over the GR model) and a significant loss of SNR. For edge-on signals containing asymmetric masses, at an SNR of 30, we find that excluding higher modes does not impact the ppE tests as much as excluding spin precession. Our analysis, therefore, identifies the spin-precessing and mass-asymmetric systems for which parametrized tests of GR are robust. With a toy model and using the linear signal approximation, we illustrate these regimes of bias and characterize them by obtaining bounds on the ratio of systematic to statistical error and the effective cycles incurred due to mismodeling. As a by-product of our analysis, we explicitly connect different measures and techniques commonly used to estimate systematic errors -- linear-signal approximation, Laplace approximation, fitting factor, effective cycles, and Bayes factor -- that are generally applicable to all studies of systematic uncertainties in gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating Anisotropic Neutron Stars with a Parametrized Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of anisotropy on slowly rotating neutron stars by extending the Hartle-Thorne formalism in general relativity to include anisotropy in pressure up to second order in the angular velocity. We assess the presence of anisotropy within the star by employing a quasi-local relationship. Our results show that the ratio between the gravitational mass of the fastest anisotropic rotating configurations and the corresponding non-rotating ones ranges from $1.12$ to $1.25$, consistent with recent findings. We develop universal relations for the moment of inertia, binding energy, and quadrupole moment of the rotating stars. These relations are tested against various equations of state, which were modeled by a piecewise polytropic function with continuous sound speed.</description>

      <title>Improved Analytic Love-C Relations for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of neutron star observables (such as mass and radius) allow one to constrain the equations of state for supranuclear matter and develop a stronger understanding of nuclear physics. The Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) tracks X-ray hotspots on rotating NSs and is able to infer precise information about the compactness of the star. Gravitational waves carry information about the tidal deformability (related to the tidal Love number) of neutron stars, which has been measured by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration. These two observables enjoy an approximately universal property between each other that is insensitive to the equations of state (the "universal Love-C relation"). In this paper, we focus on deriving two analytic expressions for the Love-C relations that are ready-to-use and improve upon previous analytic expressions. The first model is inspired by a Newtonian polytrope, whose perturbation to the gravitational potential can be found analytically. We extend this Newtonian model to the relativistic regime by providing a quadratic fit to the gravitational potential perturbation against stellar compactness. The second model makes use of the Tolman VII model and adopts a spectral expansion with Chebyshev polynomials, which converges faster than the Taylor expansions used in previous work. We find that the first model provides a more accurate description of the Love-C relation for realistic neutron stars than the second model, and it provides the best expression among all other analytic relations studied here in terms of describing the averaged numerical Love-C relation. These new models are not only useful in practice, but they also show the power and importance of analytic modeling of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Self interacting scalar field theory in general curved spacetimes at zero and finite temperature revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), its restoration and phase transition for a self interacting quantum scalar field in a general curved background, at zero and finite temperature. To the best of our knowledge, most of the earlier computations in this context have been done in the linear order in curvature, which may not be very suitable for the Ricci flat spacetimes. One of our objectives is to see whether the higher order terms can bring in qualitatively new physical effects, and thereby attempting to fill in this gap in the literature. We use the Bunch-Parker local momentum space representation of the Feynman propagator. We compute the renormalised, background spacetime curvature (up to quadratic order) and temperature dependent one loop effective potential for $\phi^4$ plus $\phi^3$ self interaction. In particular for the de Sitter spacetime, we have shown for $\phi^4$-theory that we can have SSB for a scalar even with a positive rest mass squared and non-minimal coupling, at zero temperature. This cannot be achieved by the linear curvature term alone and the result remains valid for a very large range of renormalisation scale. For a phase transition, we have computed the leading curvature correction to the critical temperature. At finite temperature, symmetry restoration is also demonstrated. We also extend some of the above results to two loop level. The symmetry breaking in de Sitter at two loop remains present. We have further motivated the necessity of treating this problem non-perturbatively in some instances.</description>

Abstract: We study modified $f(R,(\nabla R)^2,\square R)$ gravity and show in detail how it can be reduced to Einstein gravity with a few scalar fields and then represented in the form of chiral self-gravitating model of the special type. In further investigation of the model we focus on cosmology and looking for solutions of the dynamic equations of chiral fields and the Einstein-Friedman equations in the Friedman-Robertson-Walker spacetime. Exact solutions of the considered model for zero and constant potential are found. Between them power law solution corresponded to equation of state for stiff matter, de Sitter solution, trigonometric and hyperbolic expansion solution. Various type of chiral fields evolution support listed above solutions.</description>

      <title>Oppenheimer-Snyder type collapse for a collisionless gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1939, Oppenheimer and Snyder showed that the continued gravitational collapse of a self-gravitating matter distribution can result in the formation of a black hole, cf.~ \cite{OS}. In this paper, which has greatly influenced the evolution of ideas around the concept of a black hole, matter was modeled as dust, a fluid with pressure equal to zero. We prove that when the corresponding initial data are suitably approximated by data for a collisionless gas as modeled by the Vlasov equation, then a trapped surface forms before the corresponding solution to the Einstein-Vlasov system can develop a singularity and again a black hole arises. As opposed to the dust case the pressure does not vanish for such solutions. As a necessary starting point for the analysis, which is carried out in Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand coordinates, we prove a local existence and uniqueness theorem for regular solutions together with a corresponding extension criterion. The latter result will also become useful when one perturbs dust solutions containing naked singularities in the Vlasov framework.</description>

      <title>Cold Collapse and Bounce of a FLRW Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collapse of spherical cold clouds beyond black hole (BH) formation to investigate the possibility of a bounce in the in-falling matter when a critical density or pressure is reached. As a first step, we analyze the pressureless collapse in general relativity (GR), where an analytic solution exists, and demonstrate that an equivalent Newtonian solution can be derived. Such equivalence also holds for spherically symmetric perfect fluids with uniform density and non-vanishing pressure. We numerically investigate the Newtonian collapse of such clouds with masses of $5$, $20$, and $1000$ M$_\odot$ obeying a polytropic equation of state (EoS). By choosing EoS parameters inspired by typical neutron star conditions, we observe bounces at and above nuclear saturation density. Assuming approximate uniformity, we explore the equivalent GR behaviour of the matter during the bounce. Our findings are: i) A GR bounce occurs around the ground state of the matter, characterized by $P = -\rho$. ii) The GR solution significantly differs from the Newtonian result due to the presence of curvature ($k \neq 0$). iii) Both the curvature and the ground state are crucial factors in allowing a GR bounce to occur.</description>

      <title>Inflation and Acceleration of the Universe from Nonminimal Coupling Gravity with Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a nonminimal coupling model between gravity and nonlinear electrodynamics with cosmological constant. This cosmological model is designed to account for both the inflationary epoch of the early universe and the current phase of accelerated cosmic expansion. The nonlinear electrodynamic fields provide a mechanism for a graceful exit from the inflationary period, preventing the universe from entering an eternal inflation state. The addition of nonminimal coupling plays a crucial role in determining whether the transition from inflation to the subsequent cosmic phases results in accelerated or decelerated expansion. We compare the theoretical predictions of our model with recent observational data and other leading cosmological models, showing that our approach provides a viable and competitive explanation for key aspects of the universe's evolution. Our results suggest that this model offers a consistent and compelling framework to explain both early-time inflation and the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe, in line with current observations.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing dark matter halos with Extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the static, spherically symmetric metric for a black hole (BH) immersed in dark matter (DM) halo characterized by Hernquist, Burkert, and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density distributions, we calculate the orbital periods and precessions, along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) surrounded by DM halos. For the Hernquist model, we find that the gravitational force exerted by the central BH is decreased by DM halos, while DM halos put additional gravitational force on the SCO. The presence of both Burkert-type and NFW-type DM halos enhances the gravitational force acting on the SCO, resulting in a decrease in the period $P$, with the decrease depending on $M/a_0^2$; additionally, we find that the reduction in orbital precession due to DM halos is influenced by $M/a_0^2$. The presence of DM halos leads to a slower evolution of EMRIs within Hernquist-type halos, while it accelerates evolution for EMRIs in Burkert-type and NFW-type halos; furthermore, it slows the decrease of eccentricity across all three types of DM halos. By calculating the number of orbital cycles and the gravitational waveform mismatches among these three types of DM halos, as well as between scenarios with and without DM halos, we find that DM halos can be detected when $M/a_0&gt;10^{-5}$, $M/a_0&gt;10^{-3}$, and $M/a_0&gt;10^{-3}$ for Hernquist-type, NFW-type, and Burkert-type DM halos, respectively. Additionally, we can distinguish between NFW-type and Burkert-type DM halos when $M/a_0&gt; 10^{-3}$; NFW-type and Hernquist-type DM halos, as well as Burkert-type and Hernquist-type DM halos, can be distinguished when $M/a_0&gt; 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and echoes of a double braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational quasinormal modes and the gravitational echoes of a double braneworld. The double braneworld is a kind of split thick brane, which is crucial for addressing the hierarchy problem in the thick brane scenarios. Using the Bernstein spectral method, direct integration method, and asymptotic iteration method, we calculate the quasinormal mode frequencies of the double brane. We find that the quasinormal spectrum is very different from that of the single brane model, especially the high overtone mode. We also perform numerical evolution to study the time-domain properties of the characteristic modes of the double brane. The results show that when the degree of brane splitting is large, gravitational echoes of oscillation attenuation between sub-branes will appear in the thick brane. Furthermore, different long-lived Kaluza-Klein modes interfere with each other, resulting in a beating effect. Compared to a single brane model, the phenomenon of the split double brane is richer, and the lifetime of the massive Kaluza-Klein graviton of the double brane is longer. These phenomena may have potential phenomenological interest. We hope to detect these extra-dimensional signals in future gravitational wave detectors or accelerators.</description>

      <title>$\mu$-GLANCE: A Novel Technique to Detect Chromatically and Achromatically Lensed Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing occurs when the Schwarzschild radius of the lensing object is smaller or nearly equal to the wavelength of the incoming waves and can produce a chromatic amplitude and phase modulation in the Gravitational Waves (GWs) signal. In contrast, strong gravitational lensing magnifies the incoming gravitational wave in an achromatic way, but can also lead to a constant phase shift. In reality, an observed GW signal can be lensed by both microlensing and strong lensing. To detect and characterize both microlensed and strong lensed GW events together, we have developed a novel method $\mu$-GLANCE (Micro-Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-modelled Cross-correlation Exploration). In this technique, we calculate the cross-correlation of the residual between different detectors with respect to the best fit and use a generalized template to search for both GW source and lensing parameters. We assign a false alarm rate to each candidate from a statistical viewpoint, depending on how many times the noise cross-correlation matches the strength of the residual cross-correlation of the candidate. We show that for an event with a matched-filtering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) close to thirty, a residual due to microlensing with an amplitude about $10\%$ of strong lensing magnification $\mu \approx 3.2$ will start to show deviation from noise distribution at more than $68\%$ C.I with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sensitivity for the fourth observation run. If the strong lensing or microlensing amplitude is higher (or lower), a lower (or higher) matched-filtering SNR will be required to identify any deviation. This method provides the first technique to detect both strong lensing and micro-lensing without assuming any specific lensing model, and its application on the current and future GW data can identify events with both chromatic and achromatic lensed scenarios.</description>

      <title>The (1+3)-dimensional 'quantum principle of relativity' is Einstein's principle of relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $(1+3)$-dimensional `superboost' operators, proposed in Dragan and Ekert's most recent work on superluminal reference frames [arXiv:2209.01836], are simply the canonical Lorentz boosts, expressed in nonstandard notation. Their $(1+3)$-dimensional `superflip', which is claimed to interchange time and space dimensions for a superluminal observer, travelling with infinite speed, is equivalent to applying the identity operator together with an arbitrary relabelling. Physically, it corresponds to staying put within the canonical rest frame, then renaming space as `time' and time as `space'. We conclude that their extension of the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed in earlier work on $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes [arXiv:1910.02780], to ordinary Minkowski space [arXiv:2209.01836], is simply the principle of relativity proposed by Einstein in 1905.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of canonical quantization of electromagnetic field in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is shown that a consistent procedure of canonical quantization of the field can be carried out without taking into account the internal region of the black hole. We prove that there exists a unitary gauge, which can be viewed as a combination of the Coulomb and Poincare gauges and is compatible with the field equations. The solutions corresponding to the stationary one-particle states of the electromagnetic field are studied, the canonical commutation relations and the Hamiltonian of the quantized electromagnetic field are obtained.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic safe nonassociative quantum gravity with star R-flux products, Goroff-Sagnotti counter-terms, and geometric flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonassociative modifications of general relativity, GR, defined by star products with R-flux deformations in string gravity consist of an important subclass of modified gravity theories, MGTs. A longstanding criticism for elaborating quantum gravity, QG, argue that the asymptotic safety does not survive once certain perturbative terms (in general, nonassociative and noncommutative) are included in the projection space. The goal of this work is to prove that a generalized asymptotic safety scenario allows us to formulate physically viable nonassociative QG theories using effective models defined by generic off-diagonal solutions and nonlinear symmetries in nonassociative geometric flow and gravity theories. We elaborate on a new nonholonomic functional renormalization techniques with parametric renormalization group, RG, flow equations for effective actions supplemented by certain canonical two-loop counter-terms. The geometric constructions and quantum deformations are performed for nonassociative phase spaces modelled as R-flux deformed cotangent Lorentz bundles. Our results prove that theories involving nonassociative modifications of GR can be well defined both as classical nonassociative MGTs and QG models. Such theories are characterized by generalized G. Perelman thermodynamic variables which are computed for certain examples of nonassociative geometric and RG flows.</description>

      <title>Swiftly chasing gravitational waves across the sky in real-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new capability of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, dubbed `continuous commanding,' achieving 10 seconds latency response time on-orbit to unscheduled Target of Opportunity requests. This allows Swift to respond to early warning gravitational-wave detections, rapidly slewing the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) across the sky to place the GW origin in the BAT field of view at merger time. This will dramatically increase the GW/GRB co-detection rate, and enable prompt arcminute localization of a neutron star merger. We simulate the full Swift response to a GW early warning alert, including input sky maps produced at different warning times, a complete model of Swift's attitude control system, and a full accounting of the latency between the GW detectors and the spacecraft. 60 s of early warning doubles the rate of prompt GRB detections with arcminute position, and 140 s guarantees observation anywhere on the unocculted sky, even with localization areas &gt;&gt; 1000 deg$^2$. While 140 s is beyond current gravitational wave detector sensitivities, 30-70 s is achievable today. We show that the detection yield is now limited by the latency of LIGO/Virgo cyber-infrastructure, and motivate focus on its reduction. Continuous commanding is now a general capability of Swift, significantly increasing its versatility in response to the growing demands of time-domain astrophysics. We demonstrate this potential on an externally triggered Fast Radio Burst, slewing 81 degrees across the sky, and collecting X-ray and UV photons from the source position &lt; 150 s after the trigger was received from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), thereby setting the earliest and deepest such constraints on high energy activity from non-repeating FRBs. The Swift Team invites proposals for novel scientific applications of ultra-low latency UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Supermassive primordial black holes for the GHZ9 and UHZ1 observed by the JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high redshift ($z&gt;10$) galaxies GHZ9 and UHZ1 observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are very massive and have exceptionally high black hole-to-star mass ratios with the central black hole masses $M\gtrsim 10^7\rm~M_\odot$. In this paper, we explore the possibility that they are seeded by the supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs), which came into being in the very early universe, with initial masses $\sim 10^7\rm~M_\odot$. We present the self-similar accretion solutions for SMPBHs, and find that the mass growth of SMPBHs during pregalactic era may be negligible. These SMPBHs, when the redshift $z\lesssim 20$, can accelerate seeding high-redshift galaxies and their baryonic content, and consequently explain the central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of high-redshift massive galaxies through sub-Eddington accretion. According to our results, SMPBHs actually could lead to the existence of more massive SMBHs at higher redshifts compared to other SMBH seed scenarios, specially SMBHs with masses $M\gtrsim 10^7~\rm M_\odot$ at $z&gt;20$ might only origin from SMPBHs, thus the corresponding observation can serve as a potential probe to PBHs.</description>

      <title>The stress at the ISCO of black-hole accretion discs is not a free parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation from the "plunging region" (the space between the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the black-hole (BH) surface) of an accretion flow onto a BH is supposed to add a small but significant contribution to the X-ray spectra of X-ray binary systems. The plunging region and its electromagnetic emission has been recently described by numerical and analytic calculations which lead to the conclusion that in the plunging region radiation is generated by the energy release through the action of a "leftover" stress in the vicinity of the ISCO and that the amount of this leftover can be chosen as a free parameter of the accretion-flow description. The present article aims to demonstrate that this is not true because the stress in the whole accretion flow onto a black hole is determined by its global transonic character enforced by the space-time structure of the accreting black hole. We use the slim-disc approximation (SDA) to illustrate this point. In our article we compare models obtained with the SDA with results of numerical simulations and of analytical models based on the assumption that accreting matter flows along geodesics. We show that the latter cannot describe adequately the physics of astrophysical accretion onto a BH because 1. particles on geodesics cannot emit electromagnetic radiation, 2. they ignore the global transonic character of the accretion flow imposed by the presence of a stationary horizon in the BH spacetime; a presence that fixes a unique value of the angular momentum at the BH surface for a solution to exist. Therefore the fact that geodesics-based models reproduce the trans-ISCO behaviour of GRRMHD simulations proves the physical reality of neither. We show also that the claimed detection of plunging-region emission in the spectrum of an X-ray binary is unsubstantiated.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from October 2022 through May 2024 as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

      <title>Systematic 2.5 D resistive MHD simulations with ambipolar diffusion and Hall effect for fast magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion as a mechanism for fast reconnection. The reconnected flux of our resistive and resistive+Hall simulations replicates the GEM results. Furthermore, we investigate, for the first time, the effect of ambipolar diffusion in the GEM. The reconnected flux of the resistive+ambipolar and resistive+Hall+ambipolar simulations showed increases of up to 75\% and 143\%, respectively, compared to the resistive and resistive+Hall simulations, showing that ambipolar diffusion contributes significantly to the reconnected flux. Our second scenario has a magnetic Harris field without perturbations but with an out-of-plane component, known as a guide field. We found that the reconnection rate increased faster with ambipolar diffusion, reaching values close to 0.1 for the resistive+Hall+ambipolar simulation followed by the resistive+Hall. These two simulations achieved the highest kinetic energy, implying more efficient energy conversion during reconnection.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we try to interpret the origin of dark energy in quantum field theory (QFT). The vacuum energy of a field in QFT is a quartic-divergence input, and its physical contribution to dark energy is calculated in the UV-free scheme. There is a mass-energy window that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos is preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is about 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <title>Spectral energy distribution of radiation from star-like sources in the expanding Universe and once more about Olbers' paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of the expansion of the Universe on the formation of total spectral energy density of radiation in the intergalactic medium. Assuming the same proper thermal spectrum of sources, we show how the expansion of the Universe changes the nature of the energy distribution of the thermal spectrum: a decrease of the energy density in the Wien range and an increase in the Rayleigh--Jeans range with increasing the redshift of the bulk filled by sources. This is due to the cosmological redshift and the growing contribution of large number of distant sources. The numerical estimations also illustrate the main factors that resolve the Olbers' paradox in the expanding Universe: i) the particle horizon, ii) the finiteness of the volume filled by luminous objects, and iii) the cosmological redshift. Applying the obtained expressions to the epoch of reionization made it possible to estimate the concentration of objects of various classes (stars, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies) necessary for complete reionization of hydrogen at $z=6$. It is shown that even a small part of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies with a thermal spectrum of moderate temperature, from those predicted by Press-Schechter formalism and its improvements, is able to completely reionize hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at $z=6$.</description>

      <title>Bridging inflation and reheating: chiral gravitational waves from aHz to GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate chiral gravitational wave (GW) signals generated from inflation to reheating, driven by a parity-violating (PV) term coupled to the inflaton. During inflation, the PV term reduces the sound horizon for right-handed circularly polarized GWs, and amplifies their power spectra relative to left-handed GWs. At CMB scales, these chiral GWs induce BB as well as non-vanishing EB and TB correlations in CMB, which are potentially detectable by LiteBIRD. During reheating, subhorizon modes undergo tachyonic instability, leading to fully circularly polarized GWs with enhanced amplitudes, detectable through the resonant cavity experiment. The absence of backreaction effect of enhanced chiral GWs imposes constraints on the energy scale of the PV term, the inflationary potential, and the reheating history. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-frequency GW experiments to offer a unique probe of the parity violation and early Universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory, Gravity and Second order Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that a consistent coupling of a quantum theory to gravity requires an extension of ordinary `first order' Riemannian geometry to second order Riemannian geometry, which incorporates both a line element and an area element. This extension results in a misalignment between the dimension of the manifold and the dimension of the tangent spaces. In particular, we find that for a 4-dimensional spacetime, tangent spaces become 18-dimensional. We then discuss the construction of physical theories within this framework, which involves the introduction of terms that are quadratic in derivatives in the action. On a flat spacetime, the quadratic sector is perpendicular to the first order sector and only affects the normalization of the path integral, whereas in a curved spacetime the quadratic sector couples to the first order sector. Moreover, we show that, despite the introduction of higher order derivatives, the Ostragradski instability can be avoided, due to an order mixing of the two sectors. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher order geometry and on relations with non-commutative and generalized geometry.</description>

      <title>Magnetic coupling through flux branching of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inner and outer cores of neutron stars are believed to contain type-I and -II proton superconductors, respectively. The type-I superconductor exists in an intermediate state, comprising macroscopic flux-free and flux-containing regions, while the type-II superconductor is flux-free, except for microscopic, quantized flux tubes. Here, we show that the inner and outer cores are coupled magnetically, when the macroscopic flux tubes subdivide dendritically into quantized flux tubes, a phenomenon called flux branching. An important implication is that up to $\sim 10^{12} (r_1/10^6 \, {\rm cm}) \, {\rm erg}$ of energy are required to separate a quantized flux tube from its progenitor macroscopic flux tube, where $r_1$ is the length of the macroscopic flux tube. Approximating the normal-superconducting boundary as sharp, we calculate the magnetic coupling energy between a quantized and macroscopic flux tube due to flux branching as a function of, $f_1$, the radius of the type-I inner core divided by the radius of the type-II outer core. Strong coupling delays magnetic field decay in the type-II superconductor. For an idealised inner core containing only a type-I proton superconductor and poloidal flux, and in the absence of ambipolar diffusion and diamagnetic screening, the low magnetic moments ($\lesssim 10^{27} \, {\rm G \, cm^3}$) of recycled pulsars imply $f_1 \lesssim 10^{-1.5}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that a sharply peaked curvature spectrum is often considered in the literature, we examine theoretical constraints on the sharpness of such a spectrum. In particular, we show that the sharply peaked curvature power spectrum, originating from the enhancement of subhorizon perturbations during inflation, is significantly constrained by energy conservation. While the constraints do not depend on the exact form of inflaton potential, we also study concrete inflaton potentials that realize a sharply peaked curvature spectrum and how theoretical limits are saturated in these cases.</description>

      <title>Estimating False Alarm Rates of Sub-Dominant Quasi-normal Modes in GW190521</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00640v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major aim of gravitational wave astronomy is to test observationally the Kerr nature of black holes. The strongest such test, with minimal additional assumptions, is provided by observations of multiple ringdown modes, also known as black hole spectroscopy. For the gravitational wave merger event GW190521, we have previously claimed the detection of two ringdown modes emitted by the remnant black hole. In this paper we provide further evidence for the detection of multiple ringdown modes from this event. We analyse the recovery of simulated gravitational wave signals designed to replicate the ringdown properties of GW190521. We quantify how often our detection statistic reports strong evidence for a sub-dominant $(\ell,m,n)=(3,3,0)$ ringdown mode, even when no such mode is present in the simulated signal. We find this only occurs with a probability $\sim 0.02$, which is consistent with a Bayes factor of $t_{\rm ref} + 6\,\mathrm{ms}$ (1$\sigma$ uncertainty) found for GW190521. We also quantify our agnostic analysis of GW190521, in which no relationship is assumed between ringdown modes, and find that only 1 in 250 simulated signals without a $(3,3,0)$ mode yields a result as significant as GW190521. Conversely, we verify that when simulated signals do have an observable $(3,3,0)$ mode they consistently yield a strong evidence and significant agnostic results. We also find that constraints on deviations from the $(3,3,0)$ mode on GW190521-like signals with a $(3,3,0)$ mode are consistent with what was obtained from our previous analysis of GW190521. Our results support our previous conclusion that the gravitational wave signal from GW190521 contains an observable sub-dominant $(\ell,m,n)=(3,3,0)$ mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the damping of gravitational waves (GW) in $f(R)$ gravity by matter. By applying the kinetic theory, we examine the first-order approximation of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. In the flat spacetime,we derive the evolution equations for waves in $f(R)$ gravity and demonstrate that Landau damping is absent while collision damping is present. In the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology, we also examine the dynamical equations for the two modes and find that both damping phenomena exist. Furthermore, in the model $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$, we investigate the effect of the mass term on wave amplitude decay within the neutrino system. We observe that the tensor mode with $m = 1$eV exhibits faster decay compared to other cases, while the scalar mode with $m = 1$eV appears to suppress decay.</description>

      <title>Octupolar test of general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binaries with unequal masses and whose orbits are not aligned with the observer's line of sight are excellent probes of gravitational radiation beyond the quadrupole approximation. Among the compact binaries observed so far, strong evidence of octupolar modes is seen in GW190412 and GW190814, two binary black holes observed during the first half of the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo observatories. These two events, therefore, provide a unique opportunity to test the consistency of the octupolar modes with the predictions of general relativity (GR). In the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation to GR, the gravitational-wave phasing has known dependencies on different radiative multipole moments, including the mass octupole. This permits the use of publicly released posteriors of the PN phase deformation parameters for placing constraints on the deformations to the different PN components of the radiative mass octupole denoted by $\delta \mu_{3n}$. Combining the posteriors on $\delta \mu_{3n}$ from these two events, we deduce a joint bound (at 90% credibility) on the first three PN order terms in the radiative octupoles to be $\delta \mu_{30}=-0.07^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$, $\delta \mu_{32}=0.48^{+0.93}_{-1.15}$, and $\delta \mu_{33}=-0.32^{+1.67}_{-0.62}$, consistent with GR predictions. Among these, the measurement of $\delta \mu_{33}$ for the first time confirms the well-known octupolar tail contribution, a novel nonlinear effect due to the scattering of the octupolar radiation by the background spacetime, is consistent with the predictions of GR. Detection of similar systems in the future observing runs should further tighten these constraints.</description>

Abstract: We revisit Duff, Okun, and Veneziano's divergent views on the number of fundamental constants and argue that the issue can be set to rest by having spacetime as the starting point. This procedure disentangles the resolution in what depends on the assumed spacetime (whether relativistic or not) from the theories built over it. By defining that the number of fundamental constants equals the minimal number of independent standards necessary to express all observables, as assumed by Duff, Okun, and Veneziano, it is shown that the same units fixed by the apparatuses used to construct the spacetimes are enough to express all observables of the physical laws defined over them. As a result, the number of fundamental constants equals two in Galilei spacetime and one in relativistic spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Low evidence for ringdown overtone in GW150914 when marginalizing over time and sky location uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tests of the no-hair theorem using astrophysical black holes involve the detection of at least two quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the gravitational wave emitted by a perturbed black hole. A detection of two modes -- the dominant, $(\ell, m, n) = (2,2,0)$, mode and its first overtone, the $(2,2,1)$ mode -- in the post-merger signal of the binary black hole merger GW150914 was claimed in Isi et al. [arXiv:1905.00869], with further evidence provided in Isi &amp; Farr [arXiv:2202.02941]. However, Cotesta et al. [arXiv:2201.00822] disputed this claim, finding that evidence for the overtone only appeared if the signal was analyzed before merger, when a QNM description of the signal is not valid. Due to technical challenges, both of these analyses fixed the merger time and sky location of GW150914 when estimating the evidence for the overtone. At least some of the contention can be attributed to fixing these parameters. Here, we surmount this difficulty and fully marginalize over merger time and sky-location uncertainty while doing a post-merger QNM analysis of GW150914. We find that marginalizing over all parameters yields low evidence for the presence of the overtone, with a Bayes factor of $1.10\pm 0.03$ in favor of a QNM model with the overtone versus one without. The arrival time uncertainty of GW150914 is too large to definitively claim detection of the $(2,2,1)$ mode.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the theoretical possibility that a Lagrangian fixed point, when applied to cosmological models, can drive dynamical evolution towards a bouncing universe. We analyze the physics of a Lagrangian fixed point within the context of a gravitational average effective action featuring scale-dependent couplings. To explore this concept, we develop a toy model set in a four-dimensional, spatially flat spacetime, anchored by a Lagrangian fixed point. Solving the cosmological equations of this model analytically, we identify several non-trivial solution branches. These branches are characterized by a modified scale factor and dynamic gravitational couplings, offering new insights into the behavior of cosmological models under these conditions.</description>

      <title>Stability of f(Q,B) gravity via Dynamical System Approach: a Comprehensive Bayesian Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10956v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the cosmological stability of $f(Q, B)$ gravity using a dynamical system approach, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar and $B$ represents the boundary term. We determine the model parameters of $f(Q, B)$ through Bayesian statistical analysis, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. This analysis incorporates numerical solutions and observational data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the extended Pantheon$^+$ dataset, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. Our findings reveal a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model, corresponding to the de Sitter phase, which is consistent with current observations of the Universe dominated by dark energy (DE) and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion. Additionally, we utilize Centre Manifold Theory to examine the stability of this critical point, providing deeper insights into the behavior of the model. The cosmological implications of $f(Q, B)$ gravity indicate a smooth transition in the deceleration parameters from deceleration to acceleration phase, underscoring the potential of the model to describe the evolution of the Universe. Our results suggest that the $f(Q, B)$ model presents a viable alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, effectively capturing the observed acceleration of the Universe and offering a robust framework for explaining the dynamics of cosmic expansion.</description>

      <title>A new semi-coherent targeted search for continuous gravitational waves from pulsars in binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel semi-coherent targeted search method for continuous gravitational waves~(CWs) emitted by pulsars in binary systems.~The method is based on a custom optimization of the coherence time according to the orbital parameters and their uncertainties, as provided by electromagnetic observations.~While rotating pulsars are expected to produce quasi-monochromatic CWs in their reference frame, their orbital motion introduces an additional modulation in the observer frame, alongside the one due to the Earth's motion.~As a result, the received signal is dispersed across a frequency range and demodulation techniques must be used to improve sensitivity. However, Doppler corrections can, in some cases, significantly vary within the uncertainties of orbital parameters, potentially lowering the detection chances of single-template fully-coherent searches.~In order to exploit the constraints drawn from electromagnetic observations we implement a semi-coherent search, more robust than these other methods, in which the coherence time is evaluated for each source taking into account uncertainties in its orbital parameters. This method was tested and applied to a set of twelve targets from the ATNF catalogue. The search identified one outlier whose astrophysical origin has been confidently excluded. For the first time to our knowledge, we then set upper limits on the signal strain from these 12 pulsars, the lowest being $h_{UL}\sim9.01\times 10^{-26}$ for PSR~J1326-4728B.</description>

      <title>Energetics of Buchdahl stars and the magnetic Penrose process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Buchdahl star is the most compact object without an event horizon and is an excellent candidate for a black hole mimicker. Unlike black holes, rotating Buchdahl star can be over-extremal with respect to the black hole, sustaining a larger spin. We show that it can also develop an ergosphere above the threshold spin $\beta &gt; 1/\sqrt{2}$, which allows extraction of its rotational energy. Electromagnetic field around Buchdahl star is also expected to differ from that of black hole in both strength and topology. In this paper, we explore the energetics of Buchdahl star focusing on the magnetic Penrose process in the two magnetic field configurations, i.e., uniform and dipole. Below the threshold spin, Buchdahl star is expected to be quiet, while above the threshold it can be much more efficient than the black hole if a dipolar magnetic field is developed on its surface.</description>

      <title>Tidal reconstruction of neutron star mergers from their late inspiral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16729v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the measurement correlation between the effective spin and the effective tidal deformability in gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star mergers. To efficiently measure the effective tidal deformability parameter, we exploit the fact that the tidal effects in a binary system are prominent when the components are closer during the late-inspiral. Thus, we indicate to a computationally efficient strategy of extracting the tidal information compressed within seconds before the merger. We report our observations for \texttt{GW170817} and explore the suitability of our approach in the upcoming observation scenarios of the current and the future ground-based observatories. Fast and accurate measurements of the tidal deformability parameters can be used to inform astronomers in prioritizing the electromagnetic follow-up efforts for such sources.</description>

      <title>Summing Gravitational Effects from Loops of Inflationary Scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a procedure for re-summing the large logarithms induced in gravity by loops of inflationary scalars. We first show how the scalar can be integrated out of the field equations in the presence of constant graviton field. We then extend this result to a fully conserved form which explains the need for a finite renormalization of the cosmological constant which was previously inferred from explicit computation. A variant of the renormalization group turns out to explain the large logarithmic corrections revealed by explicit computation in the electric field strength of gravitational radiation and in the potentials which characterize the response to a point mass. The implications for graviton loops are discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of AdS-Schwarzschild-like black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtained the metric of the Schwarzschild-like black hole with loop quantum gravity (LQG) corrections in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time, under the assumption that the cosmological constant is decoupled in LQG. We investigated its thermodynamics, including the equation of state, criticality, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy. The $P-v$ graph was plotted, and the critical behavior was calculated. It was found that, due to the LQG effect, the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole exhibits a critical point and a critical ratio of $7/18$, which differs from the Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\mathrm{o}}$m-AdS black hole's ratio of $3/8$ (the same as that of the Van der Waals system) slightly. However, there are still some similarities compared to the Van der Waals system, such as the same critical exponents and a similar $P-v$ graph. Moreover, it is concluded that the energy-momentum tensor related to the black hole's mass could violate the conventional first law of thermodynamics. This modified first law may violate the conservation of Gibbs free energy during the small black hole-large black hole phase transitions, potentially indicating the occurrence of the zeroth-order phase transition. The Joule-Thomson expansion was also studied. Interestingly, compared to the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, the LQG effect leads to inversion points. The inversion curve divides the $\left(P,T\right)$ coordinate system into two regions: a heating region and a cooling region, as shown in detail by the inversion curves and isenthalpic curves. The results indicated that there is a minimum inversion mass, below which any black hole will not possess an inversion point.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics close to the black hole horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the object's reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes when the object is partially reflecting or the compactness differs from the black hole case. We also find that in reflective ultracompact objects some of the modes tend towards instability as the spin increases. Finally, we show that the spin enhances the deviations from the black-hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. This implies that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>

      <title>Searching for asymmetric and heavily precessing Binary Black Holes in the gravitational wave data from the LIGO and Virgo third Observing Run</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging the features of the GstLAL pipeline, we present the results of a matched filtering search for asymmetric binary black hole systems with heavily misaligned spins in LIGO and Virgo data taken during the third observing run. Our target systems show strong imprints of precession whereas current searches have non-optimal sensitivity in detecting them. After measuring the sensitivity improvement brought by our search over standard spin-aligned searches, we report the detection of 30 gravitational wave events already discovered in the latest version of the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog. However, we do not find any additional significant gravitational wave candidates. Our results allow us to place an upper limit of $R_{90\%} = 0.28^{+0.33}_{-0.04}\;\; \mathrm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ on the merger rate of a hypothetical subpopulation of asymmetric, heavily precessing signals, not identified by other searches. Since our upper limit is consistent with the latest rate estimates from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, our findings rule out the existence of a yet-to-be-discovered population of precessing binaries.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, and its cosmological implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we extend the $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity by introducing an arbitrary coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and matter Lagrangian $L_m$ in the Lagrangian density $f$ of the theory, which thus leads to the $f\left(Q,L_m\right)$ theory. This generalisation encompasses Coincident General Relativity (CGR), and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR (STEGR). Using the metric formalism, we derive the field equation of the theory, which generalizes the field equations of $f(Q)$ gravity. From the study of the covariant divergence of the field equations, it follows that the presence of the geometry-matter coupling leads to the non-conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological implications of the theory are investigated in the case of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. As a first step in this direction, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for the $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity in a general form. Specific cosmological models are investigated for several choices of $f(Q,L_m)$, including $f(Q,L_m)=-\alpha Q + 2L_m + \beta$, and $f(Q,L_m)=- \alpha Q + (2L_m)^2 + \beta$, respectively. Comparative analyses with the standard $\Lambda$ CDM paradigm are carried out, and the observational implications of the models are investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>Gravitational orbital Hall effect of vortex light in Lense-Thirring metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex light, characterized by an intrinsic orbital angular momentum aligned with its propagation direction, is described through vortex electromagnetic waves. Similar to the gravitational spin Hall effect (SHE), vortex light is expected to exhibit intrinsic orbital angular momentum dependent trajectories and deviations from the null geodesic plane when propagating through a gravitational field, a phenomenon termed the gravitational orbital Hall effect (OHE). In this work, we model the vortex light as vortex Laguerre-Gaussian electromagnetic wave packets and analyze its motion by solving covariant Maxwell equations within the Lense-Thirring metric. Our findings reveal that the trajectory of vortex light with an intrinsic orbital angular momentum deviates from the null geodesic in two ways. It deviates both perpendicular to, and within, the null geodesic plane. This behavior contrasts with the gravitational SHE, where spin-polarized light primarily deviates perpendicular to the null geodesic plane. Moreover, the relationship between the deviation and intrinsic orbital angular momentum differs significantly from that between the deviation and spin. These results suggest a unique interaction between intrinsic orbital angular momentum and gravity, distinct from the spin-gravity coupling, indicating that the gravitational OHE of light might not be precisely predicted by merely substituting spin with intrinsic orbital angular momentum in the gravitational SHE of light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) detect gravitational waves (GWs) via the correlations they create in the arrival times of pulses from different pulsars. The mean correlation, a function of the angle between the directions to two pulsars, was predicted in 1983 by Hellings and Downs (HD). Observation of this angular pattern is crucial evidence that GWs are present, so PTAs ``reconstruct the HD curve'' by estimating the correlation using pulsar pairs separated by similar angles. Several studies have examined the amount by which this curve is expected to differ from the HD mean. The variance arises because (a) a finite set of pulsars at specific sky locations is used, (b) the GW sources interfere, and (c) the data are contaminated by noise. Here, for a Gaussian ensemble of sources, we predict that variance by constructing an optimal estimator of the HD correlation, taking into account the pulsar sky locations and the frequency distribution of the GWs and the pulsar noise. The variance is a ratio: the numerator depends upon the pulsar sky locations, and the denominator is the (effective) number of frequency bins for which the GW signal dominates the noise. In effect, after suitable combination, each such frequency bin gives an independent estimate of the HD correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research delves into the potential existence of traversable wormholes (WHs) within the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ gravity, a modification that includes the matter Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor with specific coupling strengths $\alpha$ and $\beta$. A thorough examination of WH solutions is undertaken using a constant redshift function in tandem with a linear $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ model. The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on non-commutative geometry, with a particular focus on Gaussian and Lorentzian matter distributions $\rho$. Constraints on the coupling parameters are developed so that the shape function satisfies both the flaring-out and asymptotic flatness conditions. Moreover, for positive coupling parameters, violating the null energy condition (NEC) at the WH throat $r_0$ demands the presence of exotic matter. For negative couplings, however, we find that exotic matter can be avoided by establishing the upper bound $\beta+\alpha/2&lt;-\frac{1}{\rho r_0^2}-8\pi$. Additionally, the effects of gravitational lensing are explored, revealing the repulsive force of our modified gravity for large negative couplings. Lastly, the stability of the derived WH solutions is verified using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) formalism.</description>

Abstract: Theories of non-linear electrodynamics inherently describe deviations from Maxwell theory in the strong field regime. Among these, ModMax electrodynamics stands out as a unique one-parameter generalization of Maxwell theory that preserves both conformal invariance and electromagnetic duality. In this paper, we investigate the extension of Wald's magnetization within the framework of Einstein-ModMax theory, concentrating on static charged and accelerating black holes. Additionally, we examine the influence of external magnetic fields on the motion of charged test particles in the vicinity of a charged black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merger of binary black holes produces a series of decaying oscillations, during which energy is radiated in gravitational waves. The characteristic signal in the ringdown phase can be described by complex oscillation frequencies called quasinormal modes (QNMs). In this paper, we investigate the ringdown spectrum resulting from scalar field perturbations of black holes surrounded by pseudo-isothermal dark matter halos. The complex frequencies of these quasinormal modes are numerically computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation. Additionally, the time evolution of the scalar perturbations is examined using the finite difference method, considering various multipole numbers and dark matter halo parameters. For a static, spherically symmetric black hole, the photon sphere--composed of circular null geodesics--plays a crucial role in analyzing the black hole shadow. Furthermore, the connection between the black hole shadow and QNMs is explored in the eikonal limit.</description>

Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field around a charged loop quantum black hole (BH). The BH is characterized by two key parameters: the quantum parameter $b_0$ and the charge parameter $Q$. We explore two scenarios: one where the multipole quantum number $l=0$, in which only the gravitational potential is relevant, and another where $l &gt; 0$, in which both $Q$ and $b_0$ jointly influence the quasinormal frequencies (QNFs). For $l=0$, quantum gravity effects lead to a pronounced overtone outburst in the QNFs, with the outburst and accompanying oscillatory patterns becoming more pronounced as the overtone number increases. For $l &gt; 0$, the overtone outburst disappears due to the centrifugal potential's suppressive the quantum gravity effect. However, a non-monotonic behavior in the first two overtones with respect to $b_0$ is observed, indicating that subtle quantum gravity effects persist. This behavior vanishes as $Q$ increases, further confirming the suppressive influence of the centrifugal potential on the quantum gravity effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two inhomogeneous cosmological models, namely, the flat McVittie spacetime and a simple specific LTB spacetime. Relative to the world line of a reference comoving observer that remains spatially at rest, we study the local deviations of the world lines of free test particles. These local peculiar motions can be invariantly characterized within the framework of a quasi-inertial Fermi normal coordinate system established along the world line of the reference comoving observer. Peculiar motions in the two cosmological models are briefly compared and contrasted.</description>

      <title>The precession of particle spin in spherical symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we will explore the precession of particle spins in spherical spacetimes. We first argue that the geometrical optics (WKB) approximation is insufficient, due to the absence of a glory spot in the backward scattering of massless particles, making an analysis of spin precession necessary. We then derive the precession equation assuming the spin is parallel transported, which is supported by the sub-leading order of the WKB approximation. The precession equation applies to both massless and massive particles. For particles with speed $v=1$, we show that spin is always reversed after backward scattering in any spherically symmetric spacetime, confirming the absence of a glory spot for massless particles. Finally, we solve the precession equation for Schwarzschild and \acrlong{rn} spacetimes and discuss the spin precession of massive particles, particularly in the non-relativistic limit. We find that, in Schwarzschild spacetime, the spin precession for particles with $v\approx0$ depends only on the deflection angle, while in \acrlong{rn} spacetime, it also depends on the black hole charge, as revealed by the expansion derived from the strong lensing approximation.</description>

      <title>Space-based optical lattice clocks as gravitational wave detectors in search for new physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity and performance of space-based Optical Lattice Clocks (OLCs) in detecting gravitational waves, in particular the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) at low frequencies $(10^{-4}, 1) \rm Hz$, which are inaccessible to ground-based detectors. We first analyze the response characteristics of a single OLC detector for SGWB detection and compare its sensitivity with that of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to longer arm lengths, space-based OLC detectors can exhibit unique frequency responses and enhance the capability to detect SGWB in the low-frequency range, but the sensitivity of a single OLC detector remains insufficient overall compared to LISA. Then, as a preliminary plan, we propose a novel method for space-based OLC detectors that can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by utilizing the cross-correlation between two of them. This method leverages the uncorrelated origins but statistically similar properties of noise in two detectors while the SGWB signal is correlated between them, thus achieving effective noise suppression and sensitivity enhancement. Our results indicate that the cross-correlation technique can improve the sensitivity by approximately an order of magnitude compared to a single OLC detector configuration, and even would surpass current detection systems such as LISA in the full-band detection capability of SGWB.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on quantum decoherence during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.09949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since inflationary perturbations must generically couple to all degrees of freedom present in the early Universe, it is more realistic to view these fluctuations as an open quantum system interacting with an environment. Then, on very general grounds, their evolution can be modelled with a Lindblad equation. This modified evolution leads to quantum decoherence of the system, as well as to corrections to observables such as the power spectrum of curvature fluctuations. On one hand, current cosmological observations constrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the interaction strengths. On the other hand, imposing that decoherence completes by the end of inflation implies lower bounds on the interaction strengths. Therefore, the question arises of whether successful decoherence can occur without altering the power spectrum. In this paper, we systematically identify all scenarios in which this is possible. As an illustration, we discuss the case in which the environment consists of a heavy test scalar field. We show that this realises the very peculiar configuration where the correction to the power spectrum is quasi scale invariant. In that case, the presence of the environment improves the fit to the data for some inflationary models but deteriorates it for others. This clearly demonstrates that decoherence is not only of theoretical importance but can also be crucial for astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum generalisation of Einstein's Equivalence Principle can be verified with entangled clocks as quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03303v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) is of crucial importance to test the foundations of general relativity. When the particles involved in the test exhibit quantum properties, it is unknown whether this principle still holds. A violation of the EEP would have drastic consequences for physics. A more conservative possibility is that the EEP holds in a generalised form for delocalised quantum particles. Here we formulate such a generalised EEP by extending one of its paradigmatic tests with clocks to quantum clocks that are in a quantum superposition of positions and velocities. We show that the validity of such a generalised version of the EEP is equivalent to the possibility of transforming to the perspective of an arbitrary Quantum Reference Frame (QRF), namely a reference frame associated to the quantum state of the clock. We further show that this generalised EEP can be verified by measuring the proper time of entangled clocks in a quantum superposition of positions in the Earth gravitational field. The violation of the generalised EEP corresponds to the impossibility of defining dynamical evolution in the frame of each clock, and results in a modification to the probabilities of measurements calculated in the laboratory frame. Hence, it can be verified experimentally, for instance in an atom interferometer.</description>

      <title>Effective action and black hole solutions in asymptotically safe quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantum effective action and the respective quantum equations of motion from multi-graviton correlation functions in asymptotically safe quantum gravity. The fully momentum-dependent couplings of three- and four-graviton scatterings are computed within the functional renormalisation group approach and the effective action is reconstructed from these vertices. The resulting quantum equations of motion are solved numerically for quantum black hole geometries. Importantly, the black hole solutions show signatures of quantum gravity outside the classical horizon, which manifest in the behaviour of the temporal and radial components of the metric. Three different types of solutions with distinct causal structures are identified and the phase structure of the solution space is investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We comment on the so-called negative-result experiments (also known as null measurements, interaction-free measurements, and so on) in quantum mechanics (QM), in the light of the new general understanding of the quantum-measurement processes, proposed recently. All experiments of this kind (null-measurements) can be understood as improper measurements with an intentionally biased detector set up, which introduces exclusion or selection of certain events. The prediction on the state of a microscopic system under study based on a null measurement, is sometimes dramatically described as ``wave-function collapse without any microsystem-detector interactions". Though certainly correct, such a prediction is just a consequence of the standard QM laws, not different from the situation in the so-called state-preparation procedure. Another closely related concept is the (first-class or) repeatable measurements. The verification of the prediction made by a null-measurement requires eventually a standard unbiased measurement involving the microsystem-macroscopic detector interactions, which are nonadiabatic, irreversible processes of signal amplification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that if two distant test masses, each in a spatially superposed quantum state, become entangled due to their mutual gravitational interaction, then this entanglement could serve as evidence of the quantum nature of gravity. We extend this treatment to a many-body system in a general setup and study the entanglement properties of the time-evolved state. We exactly compute the time-dependent I-concurrence for every bipartition and obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for the creation of genuine many-body entanglement. We further show that this entanglement is of generalised GHZ type when certain conditions are met. We also evaluate the amount of multipartite entanglement in the system using a set of generalised Meyer-Wallach measures.</description>

      <title>Induced gravitational waves: the effect of first order tensor perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar induced gravitational waves contribute to the cosmological gravitational wave background. They can be related to the primordial density power spectrum produced towards the end of inflation and therefore are a convenient new tool to constrain models of inflation. These waves are sourced by terms quadratic in perturbations and hence appear at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. While the focus of research so far was on purely scalar source terms we also study the effect of including first order tensor perturbations as an additional source. This gives rise to two additional source terms: a term quadratic in the tensor perturbations and a cross term involving mixed scalar and tensor perturbations. We present full analytical expressions for the spectral density of these new source terms and discuss their general behaviour. To illustrate the generation mechanism we study two toy models containing a peak on small scales. For these models we show that the scalar-tensor contribution becomes non-negligible compared to the scalar-scalar contribution on smaller scales. We also consider implications for future gravitational wave surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we present an algebraic and kinematical analysis of non-commutative $\kappa$-Minkowski spaces within Galilean (non-relativistic) and Carrollian (ultra-relativistic) regimes. Utilizing the theory of Wigner-In\"{o}nu contractions, we begin with a brief review of how one can apply these contractions to the well-known Poincar\'e algebra, yielding the corresponding Galilean (both massive and mass-less) and Carrollian algebras as $c \to \infty$ and $c\to 0$, respectively. Subsequently, we methodically apply these contractions to non-commutative $\kappa$-deformed spaces, revealing compelling insights into the interplay among the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$ (with $|a^\nu|$ being of the order of Planck length scale) and the speed of light $c$ as it approaches both infinity and zero. Our exploration predicts a sort of "branching" of the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$, leading to the emergence of a novel length scale and time scale in either limit. Furthermore, our investigation extends to the examination of curved momentum spaces and their geodesic distances in appropriate subspaces of the $\kappa$-deformed Newtonian and Carrollian space-times. We finally delve into the study of their deformed dispersion relations, arising from these deformed geodesic distances, providing a comprehensive understanding of the nature of these space-times.</description>

      <title>Relativity of the event: examples in JT gravity and linearized GR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observables in quantum gravity are famously defined asymptotically, at the boundary of AdS or Minkowski spaces. However, by gauge fixing a coordinate system or suitably dressing the field operators, an approximate, "quasi-local" approach is also possible, that can give account of the measurements performed by a set of observers living inside the spacetime. In particular, one can attach spatial coordinates to the worldlines of these observers and use their proper times as a time coordinate. Here we highlight that any such local formulation has to face the relativity of the event, in that changing frame (= set of observers) implies a reshuffling of the point-events and the way they are identified. As a consequence, coordinate transformations between different frames become probabilistic in quantum gravity. We give a concrete realization of this mechanism in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, where a point in the bulk can be defined operationally with geodesics anchored to the boundary. We describe different ways to do so, each corresponding to a different frame, and compute the variances of the transformations relating some of these frames. In particular, we compute the variance of the location of the black hole horizon, which appears smeared in most frames. We then suggest how to calculate this effect in Einstein gravity, assuming knowledge of the wavefunction of the metric. The idea is to expand the latter on a basis of semiclassical states. Each element of this basis enjoys standard/deterministic coordinate transformations and the result is thus obtained by superposition. As a divertissement, we sabotage the familiar Lorentz boosts by adding to Minkoswki spacetime a quantum superposition of gravitational waves and compute the probabilistic transformation to a boosted frame in linearized gravity. Finally, we attempt to translate the relativity of the event in the language of dressed operators.</description>

      <title>Firewalls at exponentially late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a version of the typical state firewall setup recently reintroduced by Stanford and Yang, who found that wormholes may create firewalls. We examine a late-time double scaling limit in JT gravity in which one can resum the expansion in the number of wormholes, and we use this to study the exact distribution of interior slices at times exponential in the entropy. We consider a thermofield double with and without early perturbations on a boundary. These perturbations can appear on interior slices as dangerous high energy shocks. For exponentially late times, wormholes tend to teleport the particles created by perturbations and render the interior more dangerous. In states with many perturbations separated by large times, the probability of a safe interior is exponentially small. Such states thus almost certainly have firewalls at the horizon, even though they would be safe without wormholes. With perturbation, even in the safest state we conceive, the odds of encountering a firewall are fifty-fifty. One interpretation of the phenomena found here is that wormholes can change time-ordered contours into effective out-of-time-ordered folds, making shockwaves appear in unexpected places.</description>

      <title>Enhanced primordial gravitational waves from a stiff post-inflationary era due to an oscillating inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of inflationary models, which lead to a stiff period after inflation that boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). In both families of models studied, we consider an oscillating scalar condensate, which when far away from the minimum it is overdamped by a warped kinetic term, a la $\alpha$-attractors. This leads to successful inflation. The oscillating condensate is in danger of becoming fragmented by resonant effects when non-linearities take over. Consequently, the stiff phase cannot be prolonged enough to enhance primordial GWs at frequencies observable in the near future for low orders of the envisaged scalar potential. However, this is not the case for a higher-order scalar potential. Indeed, we show that this case results in a boosted GW spectrum that overlaps with future observations without generating too much GW radiation to de-stabilise Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. For example, taking $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$, we find that the GW signal can be safely enhanced up to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\sim 10^{-11}$ at frequency $f\sim 10^2\,$Hz, which will be observable by the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our mechanism ends up with a characteristic GW spectrum, which if observed, can lead to the determination of the inflation energy scale, the reheating temperature and the shape (steepness) of the scalar potential around the minimum.</description>

      <title>Robustness of inflation to kinetic inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large inhomogeneities in both the inflaton field and its momentum. We find that in general, large kinetic perturbations reduce the number of e-folds of inflation. In particular, we observe that inflationary models with sub-Planckian characteristic scales are not robust even to kinetic energy densities that are sub-dominant to the potential energy density, unless the initial field configuration is sufficiently far from the minimum. This strengthens the results of our previous work. In inflationary models with super-Planckian characteristic scales, despite a reduction in the number of e-folds, inflation is robust even when the potential energy density is initially sub-dominant. For the cases we study, the robustness of inflation strongly depends on whether the inflaton field is driven into the reheating phase by the inhomogeneous scalar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the nonprojectable Horava theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the proof of renormalization of the Horava theory, in the nonprojectable version. We obtain a form of the quantum action that exhibits a manifest BRST-symmetry structure. Previous analysis has shown that the divergences produced by irregular loops cancel completely between them. The remaining divergences are local. The renormalization is achieved by using the approach developed by Barvinsky et al. with the background-field formalism.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Black Bounce to Transversable Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a way for embedding a 4-dimensional geometry corresponding to the Simpson Visser (SV) spacetime which is capable of representing a traversable wormhole, a one-way wormhole, or a regular black hole into a Randall-Sundrum setup. To achieve this, we linearly deform the bulk geometry and the bulk matter distribution concerning a coupling constant. These deformations induce a transition from a $5D$ vacuum AdS state to an anisotropic matter distribution. The latter results in the induced geometry on the brane transitioning from a singular Schwarzschild spacetime to a regularized SV spacetime. Since there are no sources or matter fields on the brane, we can assert that the induced SV geometry on the brane arises from the influence of geometrical and matter deformations in the bulk. Thus, the central singularity is suppressed. We determine the cases where the energy conditions are either satisfied or violated. Our spacetime is asymptotically radial AdS, which is intriguing given the absence of a global AdS box that would prevent instability under larger wavelength perturbations. Therefore, it is no longer appropriate to claim that instability exists for very small perturbations near the AdS horizon. Thus, we propose that the stability of the solution can be analyzed by examining the speed of sound due to the presence of matter fields in the energy momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Emergent Time in Hamiltonian General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a definition of time that emerges in terms of the geometry of the configuration space of a dynamical system. We illustrate this, using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, in various examples: particle mechanics on a fixed energy surface; non-Abelian gauge theories for compact semi-simple Lie groups where the Gauss law presents new features; and General Relativity in $d+1$ dimensions with $d$ the dimension of space. The discussion in General Relativity is like the non-abelian gauge theory case except for the indefiniteness of the de Witt metric in the Einstein-Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which we discuss in some detail. We illustrate the general formula for the emergent time in various examples including de Sitter spacetime and asymptotically AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the binary viewing angle bias for standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inconsistency between experiments in the measurements of the local Universe expansion rate, the Hubble constant, suggests unknown systematics in the existing experiments or new physics. Gravitational-wave standard sirens, a method to independently provide direct measurements of the Hubble constant, have the potential to address this tension. Before that, it is critical to ensure there is no substantial systematics in the standard siren method. A significant systematic has been identified when the viewing angle of the gravitational-wave sources, the compact binary coalescences, is inferred inaccurately from electromagnetic observations of the sources. Such systematic has led to more than 10% discrepancy in the standard siren Hubble constant measurements with the observations of binary neutron star merger, GW170817. In this Letter, we develop a new formalism to infer and mitigate this systematic. We demonstrate that the systematic uncertainty of the Hubble constant measurements can be reduced to smaller than their statistical uncertainty with 5, 10, and 20 binary neutron star merger observations. We show that our formalism successfully reduces the systematics even if the shape of the biased viewing angle distribution does not follow precisely the model we choose. Our formalism ensures unbiased standard siren Hubble constant measurements when the binary viewing angles are inferred from electromagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic equilibrium of X-ray gas in X-COP clusters with HMG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) was originally proposed to model galaxy rotation curves without dark matter. However, MOND presents difficulties in explaining the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) observed in galaxy clusters, and moreover, it does not completely eliminate the need for dark matter, since it requires using non-luminous particles (e.g. cold molecular gas or durst, or neutrinos) to explain the observed hydrostatic equilibrium of the hot gas. Hyperconical Modified Gravity (HMG) offers a relativistic framework that recovers the success of MOND in galaxy rotation curves as a natural particular case, and it could potentially reconcile the above discrepancies without invoking any type of dark matter. This Letter analyses the performance of the HMG model for hydrostatic equilibrium in 12 X-COP galaxy clusters, with a special focus on five objects with available complete stellar mass information: A1795, A2029, A2142, A2319 and A644. Specifically, we used high-resolution X-ray data with which gas density and mass profiles were previously derived to constrain modified gravity models. Our results show that the hydrostatic equilibrium of analysed cluster gas is more naturally adjusted to the HMG model beyond 500 kpc without the need to fit parameters, but further research is required to expand to more spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Explicit Construction of Hermitian Yang-Mills Instantons on Coset Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In four dimensions, 't Hooft symbols offer a compact and powerful framework for describing the self-dual structures fundamental to instanton physics. Extending this to six dimensions, the six-dimensional 't Hooft symbols can be constructed using the isomorphism between the Lorentz group $Spin(6)$ and the unitary group $SU(4)$. We demonstrate that the six-dimensional self-dual structures governed by the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations can be elegantly organized using these generalized 't Hooft symbols. We also present a systematic method for constructing Hermitian Yang-Mills instantons from spin connections on six-dimensional manifolds using the generalized 't Hooft symbols. We provide a thorough analysis of the topological invariants such as instanton and Euler numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of Einstein gravity with vanishing cosmological constant subjected to conformal boundary conditions. Our focus is on comparing the series of subextensive terms to predictions from thermal effective field theory, with which we find agreement for the boundary theory on a spatial sphere, hyperbolic space, and flat space. We calculate the leading Wilson coefficients and observe that the first subextensive correction to the free energy is negative. This violates a conjectured bound on this coefficient in quantum field theory, which we interpret as a signal that gravity does not fully decouple in the putative boundary dual.</description>

      <title>Geometric realization from irrelevant deformations induced by the stress-energy tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal O$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, the deformations of Lagrangians for scalar field theories are performed.</description>

      <title>Dirac Operators on Configuration Spaces and Yang-Mills Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a connection between Dirac operators on configuration spaces and Yang-Mills quantum field theory. We first show that the Hamilton operators of the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory emerge from unitary transformations of a Dirac equation formulated on a configuration space of gauge connections. Secondly, we formulate a Bott-Dirac operator on the configuration space and demonstrate how the Hamilton operator of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory coupled to a fermionic sector emerges from its square. Finally, we discuss a spectral invariant that emerges in this framework.</description>
