      <title>The Origin of Sound Damping in Amorphous Solids: Defects and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehending sound damping is integral to understanding the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses. After decades of theoretical and experimental studies, Rayleigh scattering scaling of the sound attenuation coefficient with frequency, $\Gamma \sim \omega^{d+1}$, became generally accepted when quantum and finite temperature effects can be neglected. Rayleigh scaling invokes a picture of scattering from defects. However, it is unclear how to define glass defects, or even if defects are necessary for Rayleigh scaling. Here we determine a particle level contribution to sound damping in the Rayleigh scaling regime. We find that there are areas in the glass that contribute more to sound damping than other areas over a range of frequencies, which allows us to define defects. We show that over a range of glass stability, sound damping scales linearly with the fraction of particles in the defects. However, sound is still attenuated in ultra-stable glasses where no defects are identified. We show that sound damping in these glasses is due to nearly uniformly distributed non-affine, microscopic forces that arise after macroscopic deformations of non-centrosymetric structures. To fully understand sound attenuation in glasses one has to consider contributions from defects and a defect-free background, which represents a new paradigm of sound damping in glasses.</description>

      <title>The localized phase of the Anderson model on the Bethe lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Anderson model on the Bethe lattice, focusing on the localized regime. Employing the cavity approach, we derive compact expressions for the inverse participation ratios (IPRs) that are equivalent to those obtained using the supersymmetric formalism and naturally facilitate a highly efficient computational scheme. This method yields numerical results with unprecedented accuracy, even very close to the localization threshold. Our approach allows for high-precision validation of all theoretical predictions from the analytical solution, including the finite jump of the IPRs at the transition. Additionally, we reveal a singular behavior of the IPRs near the critical point that has not been previously reported in the literature. This singular behavior is further confirmed by the numerical solution of the non-linear $\sigma$ model on the Bethe lattice, which provides an effective description of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Random Neural Networks: a Special Renewal Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an open anomalous semi-Markovian random neural networks model with negative and positive signals with arbitrary random waiting times. We investigate the signal flow process in the anomalous random neural networks based on renewal process, and obtain the corresponding master equation for time evolution of the probability of the potential of the neurons. As examples, we discuss the special cases of exponential waiting times and power law ones, and find the fractional memory effect of the probability of the system state on its history evolution. Besides, the closed random neural networks model is introduced and the corresponding rate equation is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the groundbreaking work of Erd$\ddot{o}$s-R$\acute{e}$nyi random graph, the random networks has made great progress in recent years. One of the eye-catching modeling is time-varying random network model capable of encoding the instantaneous time description of the network dynamics. To further describe the random duration time for the nodes to be inactive, we herein propose a dinner party anomalous random networks model, and derive the analytical solution of the probability density function for the node being active at a given time. Moreover, we investigate the gift delivery and viral transmission in dinner party random networks. This work provides new quantitative insights in describing random networks, and could help model other uncertainty phenomena in real networks.</description>

      <title>Networks with many structural scales: a Renormalization Group perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance profoundly influences the dynamics and structure of complex systems, spanning from critical phenomena to network architecture. Here, we propose a precise definition of scale-invariant networks by leveraging the concept of a constant entropy loss rate across scales in a renormalization-group coarse-graining setting. This framework enables us to differentiate between scale-free and scale-invariant networks, revealing distinct characteristics within each class. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive inventory of genuinely scale-invariant networks, both natural and artificially constructed, demonstrating, e.g., that the human connectome exhibits notable features of scale invariance. Our findings open new avenues for exploring the scale-invariant structural properties crucial in biological and socio-technological systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Hilbert space fragmentation in group-valued loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of single particle excitations across the many-body localization transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of the transition from the delocalized to the many-body localized (MBL) phase is an important unresolved issue. To probe the nature of the MBL transition, we investigate the universal properties of single-particle excitations produced in highly excited many-body eigenstates of a disordered interacting quantum many-body system. In a class of one-dimensional spinless fermionic models with random disorder, we study the finite size scaling of the ratio of typical to average values of the single-particle local density of states and the scattering rates across the MBL transition. Our results indicate that the MBL transition in this class of one-dimensional models of spinless fermions is continuous in nature. For various ranges of interactions in the system, the critical exponent $\nu$ with which the correlation length $\xi$ diverges at the transition point $W_c$, $\xi \sim |W-W_c|^{-\nu}$, satisfies the Chayes-Chayes-Fisher-Spencer(CCFS) bound $\nu \ge 2/d$ where $d$ is the physical dimension of the system. We also discuss why the critical exponent obtained from finite-size scaling of the conventional diagnostic of many-body localization, the level-spacing ratio, strongly violates the CCFS bound while the single-particle density of states and scattering rates are consistent with the CCFS criterion.</description>

      <title>Level spacing distribution of localized phases induced by quasiperiodic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Level statistics is a crucial tool in the exploration of localization physics. The level spacing distribution of the disordered localized phase follows Poisson statistics, and many studies naturally apply it to the quasiperiodic localized phase. Here we analytically obtain the level spacing distribution of the quasiperiodic localized phase, and find that it deviates from Poisson statistics. Moreover, based on this level statistics, we derive the ratio of adjacent gaps and find that for a single sample, it is a $\delta$ function, which is in excellent agreement with numerical studies. Additionally, unlike disordered systems, in quasiperiodic systems, there are variations in the level spacing distribution across different regions of the spectrum, and increasing the size and increasing the sample are non-equivalent. Our findings carry significant implications for the reevaluation of level statistics in quasiperiodic systems and a profound understanding of the distinct effects of quasiperiodic potentials and disorder induced localization.</description>

      <title>Odd Dipole Screening in Radial Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of "Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations using an annealing-based approach is based on solving generalized eigenvalue problems. When a partial differential equation is discretized, it leads to a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be expressed as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be converted into an optimization problem with the objective function being a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm allows the computation of eigenvectors at arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables using an Ising machine. Simple examples solved using this method and theoretical analysis provide a guideline for appropriate parameter settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy corner modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.</description>
