      <title>PPAAS: PVT and Pareto Aware Analog Sizing via Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device sizing is a critical yet challenging step in analog and mixed-signal circuit design, requiring careful optimization to meet diverse performance specifications. This challenge is further amplified under process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, which cause circuit behavior to shift across different corners. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in automating sizing for fixed targets, training a generalized policy that can adapt to a wide range of design specifications under PVT variations requires much more training samples and resources. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{Goal-conditioned RL framework} that enables efficient policy training for analog device sizing across PVT corners, with strong generalization capability. To improve sample efficiency, we introduce Pareto-front Dominance Goal Sampling, which constructs an automatic curriculum by sampling goals from the Pareto frontier of previously achieved goals. This strategy is further enhanced by integrating Conservative Hindsight Experience Replay, which assigns relabeled goals with conservative virtual rewards to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. To reduce simulation overhead, our framework incorporates a Skip-on-Fail simulation strategy, which skips full-corner simulations when nominal-corner simulation fails to meet target specifications. Experiments on benchmark circuits demonstrate $\sim$1.6$\times$ improvement in sample efficiency and $\sim$4.1$\times$ improvement in simulation efficiency compared to existing sizing methods.

      <title>Efficient and Distortion-less Spectrum Multiplexer via Neural Network-based Filter Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum multiplexer enables simultaneous transmission of multiple narrow-band IoT signals through gateway devices, thereby enhancing overall spectrum utilization. We propose a novel solution based on filter banks that offer increased efficiency and minimal distortion compared with conventional methods. We follow a model-driven approach to integrate the neural networks into the filter bank design by interpreting the neural network models as filter banks. The proposed NN-based filter banks can leverage advanced learning capabilities to achieve distortionless multiplexing and harness hardware acceleration for high efficiency. Then, we evaluate the performance of the spectrum multiplexer implemented by NN-based filter banks for various types of signals and environmental conditions. The results show that it can achieve a low distortion level down to $-39$dB normalized mean squared error. Furthermore, it achieves up to $35$ times execution efficiency gain and $10$dB SNR gain compared with the conventional methods. The field applications show that it can handle both the heterogeneous and homogeneous IoT networks, resulting in high packet reception ratio at the standard receivers up to $98\%$.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurface Assisted Multiuser Communications: From a Rate Fairness Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) extends the concept of single-layer reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) by incorporating a multi-layered structure, thereby providing enhanced control over electromagnetic wave propagation and improved signal processing capabilities. This study investigates the potential of SIM in enhancing the rate fairness in multiuser downlink systems by addressing two key optimization problems: maximizing the minimum rate (MR) and maximizing the geometric mean of rates (GMR). {The former strives to enhance the minimum user rate, thereby ensuring fairness among users, while the latter relaxes fairness requirements to strike a better trade-off between user fairness and system sum-rate (SR).} For the MR maximization, we adopt a consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based approach, which decomposes the approximated problem into sub-problems with closed-form solutions. {For GMR maximization, we develop an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that also yields closed-form solutions and can be seamlessly adapted for SR maximization. Numerical results validate the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithms.} Comparative evaluations show that MR maximization ensures near-perfect fairness, while GMR maximization balances fairness and system SR. Furthermore, the two proposed algorithms respectively outperform existing related works in terms of MR and SR performance. Lastly, SIM with lower power consumption achieves performance comparable to that of multi-antenna digital beamforming.</description>

      <title>Design of a Noval Wearable ECG Monitoring Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this project is to develop a new wireless powered wearable ECG monitoring device. The main goal of the project is to provide a wireless, small-sized ECG monitoring device that can be worn for a long period of time by the monitored person. Electrocardiogram ECG reflects physiological and pathological information about heart activity and is commonly used to diagnose heart disease. Existing wearable smart ECG solutions suffer from high power consumption in both ECG diagnosis and transmission for high accuracy. Monitoring of ECG devices is mainly done by data extraction and acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, processing and analysis, visualisation and auxiliary procedures. During the pre-processing of the information, different kinds of noise generated during the signal collection need to be taken into account. The quality of the signal-to-noise ratio can usually be improved by optimising algorithms and reducing the noise power. The choice of electrodes usually has a direct impact on the signal-to-noise ratio and the user experience, and conventional Ag/AgCl gel electrodes are not suitable for long-term and dynamic monitoring as they are prone to skin irritation, inflammation and allergic reactions. Therefore, a completely new way of combining electrodes and wires will be used in the report. The electrodes and wires are cut in one piece from a silver-plated fabric. The wire portion is cut into a curved structure close to an S shape to ensure that it has good ductility for comfort and signal integrity during daily movement of the garment.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Semantic-Complementary Transmission for High-Fidelity Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in semantic communication (SC) have introduced neural network (NN)-based transceivers that convey semantic representation (SR) of signals such as images. However, these NNs are trained over diverse image distributions and thus often fail to reconstruct fine-grained image-specific details. To overcome this limited reconstruction fidelity, we propose an extended SC framework, hybrid semantic communication (HSC), which supplements SR with complementary representation (CR) capturing residual image-specific information. The CR is constructed at the transmitter, and is combined with the actual SC outcome at the receiver to yield a high-fidelity recomposed image. While the transmission load of SR is fixed due to its NN-based structure, the load of CR can be flexibly adjusted to achieve a desirable fidelity. This controllability directly influences the final reconstruction error, for which we derive a closed-form expression and the corresponding optimal CR. Simulation results demonstrate that HSC substantially reduces MSE compared to the baseline SC without CR transmission across various channels and NN architectures.</description>

      <title>HuiduRep: A Robust Self-Supervised Framework for Learning Neural Representations from Extracellular Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracellular recordings are brief voltage fluctuations recorded near neurons, widely used in neuroscience as the basis for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, which assigns each spike to its source neuron, is a critical step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular spike waveforms. By combining contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations that are robust to noise and drift. Built on HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without supervision. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness and the pipeline matches or outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.</description>

      <title>Joint Resource Optimization Over Licensed and Unlicensed Spectrum in Spectrum Sharing UAV Networks Against Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is of crucial importance in realizing heterogeneous practical wireless application scenarios. However, the densely populated users and diverse services with high data rate demands has triggered an increasing scarcity of UAV spectrum utilization. To tackle this problem, it is promising to incorporate the underutilized unlicensed spectrum with the licensed spectrum to boost network capacity. However, the openness of unlicensed spectrum makes UAVs susceptible to security threats from potential jammers. Therefore, a spectrum sharing UAV network coexisting with licensed cellular network and unlicensed Wi-Fi network is considered with the anti-jamming technique in this paper. The sum rate maximization of the secondary network is studied by jointly optimizing the transmit power, subchannel allocation, and UAV trajectory. We first decompose the challenging non-convex problem into two subproblems, 1) the joint power and subchannel allocation and 2) UAV trajectory design subproblems. A low-complexity iterative algorithm is proposed in a alternating optimization manner over these two subproblems to solve the formulated problem. Specifically, the Lagrange dual decomposition is exploited to jointly optimize the transmit power and subchannel allocation iteratively. Then, an efficient iterative algorithm capitalizing on successive convex approximation is designed to get a suboptimal solution for UAV trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly improve the sum transmission rate compared with the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>State Estimation with 1-Bit Observations and Imperfect Models: Bussgang Meets Kalman in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation from noisy observations is a fundamental problem in many applications of signal processing. Traditional methods, such as the extended Kalman filter, work well under fully-known Gaussian models, while recent hybrid deep learning frameworks, combining model-based and data-driven approaches, can also handle partially known models and non-Gaussian noise. However, existing studies commonly assume the absence of quantization distortion, which is inevitable, especially with non-ideal analog-to-digital converters. In this work, we consider a state estimation problem with 1-bit quantization. 1-bit quantization causes significant quantization distortion and severe information loss, rendering conventional state estimation strategies unsuitable. To address this, inspired by the Bussgang decomposition technique, we first develop the Bussgang-aided Kalman filter by assuming perfectly known models. The proposed method suitably captures quantization distortion into the state estimation process. In addition, we propose a computationally efficient variant, referred to as the reduced Bussgang-aided Kalman filter and, building upon it, introduce a deep learning-based approach for handling partially known models, termed the Bussgang-aided KalmanNet. In particular, the Bussgang-aided KalmanNet jointly uses a dithering technique and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture to effectively mitigate the effects of 1-bit quantization and model mismatch. Through simulations on the Lorenz-Attractor model and the Michigan NCLT dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve accurate state estimation performance even under highly nonlinear, mismatched models and 1-bit observations.</description>

      <title>Non-Orthogonal AFDM: A Promising Spectrum-Efficient Waveform for 6G High-Mobility Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a spectrum-efficient nonorthogonal affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform for reliable high-mobility communications in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) mobile systems. Our core idea is to introduce a compression factor to enable controllable subcarrier overlapping in chirp-based AFDM modulation. To mitigate intercarrier interference (ICI), we introduce linear precoding at the transmitter and an iterative detection scheme at the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate that these techniques can effectively reduce interference and maintain robust bit error rate (BER) performance even under aggressive compression factors and high-mobility channel conditions. The proposed non-orthogonal AFDM waveform offers a promising solution for next-generation wireless networks, balancing spectrum efficiency and Doppler resilience in highly dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>LightCom: A Generative AI-Augmented Framework for QoE-Oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-intensive and immersive applications, such as virtual reality, impose stringent quality of experience (QoE) requirements that challenge traditional quality of service (QoS)-driven communication systems. This paper presents LightCom, a lightweight encoding and generative AI (GenAI)-augmented decoding framework, designed for QoE-oriented communications under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. LightCom simplifies transmitter design by applying basic low-pass filtering for source coding and minimal channel coding, significantly reducing processing complexity and energy consumption. At the receiver, GenAI models reconstruct high-fidelity content from highly compressed and degraded signals by leveraging generative priors to infer semantic and structural information beyond traditional decoding capabilities. The key design principles are analyzed, along with the sufficiency and error-resilience of the source representation. We also develop importance-aware power allocation strategies to enhance QoE and extend perceived coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that LightCom achieves up to a $14$ dB improvement in robustness and a $9$ dB gain in perceived coverage, outperforming traditional QoS-driven systems relying on sophisticated source and channel coding. This paradigm shift moves communication systems towards human-centric QoE metrics rather than bit-level fidelity, paving the way for more efficient and resilient wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a slotted patch antenna integrated with a partially reflected surface (PRS) to operate in the TeraHertz (THz) frequency range for 6G. The antenna is based on graphene material, on a Rogers RT Duroid 6010 substrate. The proposed antenna achieves a bandwidth of 70 GHz (750 GHz to 820 GHz). The PRS sheet consists of 5x4 unit cells, which are optimised to enhance the overall realized gain of the antenna. The overall realized gain has increased by 1.07 dBi. Also, the PRS enhanced the antenna radiation pattern, showing stable properties over the operating bandwidth. The improved antenna performance is validated via simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning from Scratch: Structurally-masked Transformer for Next Generation Lib-free Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a neural framework for power and timing prediction of multi-stage data path, distinguishing itself from traditional lib-based analytical methods dependent on driver characterization and load simplifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard cells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without requiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction, we implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from each stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across the logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level encoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality constraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary delay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate SPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse industrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally adaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines, demonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes power allocation and the number of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) elements optimisation in a RIS-assisted rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) system. The optimised RIS-RSMA (ORIS-RSMA) method determines the optimal number of RIS elements and the power allocation factors for both common and private parts of a message. Additionally, it maximises the sum rate while ensuring that a target common rate is satisfied. The performance of the proposed ORIS-RSMA is compared to that of the conventional RIS-RSMA and RSMA. Simulation results show that ORIS-RSMA achieves a higher sum rate.</description>

      <title>Detecting Multiple Targets with Distributed Sensing and Communication in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates multi-target detection in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) framework. We adopt a user-centric approach for communication user equipments (UEs) and a distributed sensing approach for multi-target detection. A heuristic access point (AP) mode selection algorithm and a channel-aware distributed sensing scheme are proposed, where local measurements at receive APs (RX-APs) are weighted based on the received signals signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). A maximum a posteriori ratio test (MAPRT) detector is applied under two awareness levels at RX-APs. To balance the communication-sensing trade-off, we develop a power allocation algorithm to jointly maximize the minimum detection probability and communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while satisfying power constraints. The proposed scheme outperforms non-weighted methods. Adding test statistics from more RX-APs can degrade sensing performance due to weaker channels, but this effect can be mitigated by optimizing the weighting exponent. Additionally, assigning more sensing RX-APs to a sensing area results in approximately 10 dB loss in minimum communication SINR due to limited communication resources.</description>

Abstract: We investigate whether equipping fluid-antenna (FA) receivers with multiple ($L&gt;1$) radiofrequency (RF) chains can improve the performance of the slow fluid-antenna multiple access (FAMA) technique, which enables open-loop connectivity with channel state information (CSI) available only at the receiver side. We analyze the case of slow-FAMA users equipped with multiport receivers, so that $L$ ports of the FA are selected and combined to reduce interference. We show that a joint design of the port selection matrix and the combining vector at each receiver yields significant performance gains over reference schemes, demonstrating the potential of multiport reception in FA systems with a limited number of RF chains.</description>

      <title>Joint Multi-Target Detection-Tracking in Cognitive Massive MIMO Radar via POMCP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This correspondence presents a power-aware cognitive radar framework for joint detection and tracking of multiple targets in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar environment. Building on a previous single-target algorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend it to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree, enabling scalable and efficient planning.
  Departing from uniform power allocation-which is often suboptimal with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)-our approach predicts each target's future angular position and expected received power, based on its estimated range and radar cross-section (RCS). These predictions guide adaptive waveform design via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to enhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring sufficient power for high-SNR targets. The reward function in the underlying partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is also modified to prioritize accurate spatial and power estimation.
  Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the effectiveness of our method. The proposed framework for the cognitive radar improves detection probability for low-SNR targets and achieves more accurate tracking compared to approaches using uniform or orthogonal waveforms. These results demonstrate the potential of the POMCP-based framework for adaptive, efficient multi-target radar systems.</description>

      <title>SA-WiSense: A Blind-Spot-Free Respiration Sensing Framework for Single-Antenna Wi-Fi Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing offers a promising technique for contactless human respiration monitoring. A key challenge, however, is the blind spot problem caused by random phase offsets that corrupt the complementarity of respiratory signals. To address the challenge, we propose a single-antenna-Wi-Fi-sensing (SA-WiSense) framework to improve accuracy of human respiration monitoring, robust against random phase offsets. The proposed SA-WiSense framework is cost-efficient, as only a single antenna is used rather than multiple antennas as in the previous works. Therefore, the proposed framework is applicable to Internet of Thing (IoT), where most of sensors are equipped with a single antenna. On one hand, we propose a cross-subcarrier channel state information (CSI) ratio (CSCR) based blind spot mitigation approach for IoT, where the ratios of two values of CSI between subcarriers are leveraged to mitigate random phase offsets. We prove that the random phase offsets can be cancelled by the proposed CSCR approach, thereby restoring the inherent complementarity of signals for blind-spot-free sensing. On the other hand, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) based subcarrier selection (GASS) approach by formulating an optimization problem in terms of the sensing-signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) of CSCR between subcarriers. GA is utilized to solve the formulated optimization problem. We use commodity ESP32 microcontrollers to build an experiment test. The proposed works are validated to achieve an detection rate of 91.2% for respiration monitoring at distances up to 8.0 meters, substantially more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods with a single antenna.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-Domain Super MDS for Robust 3D Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel low-complexity three-dimensional (3D) localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks, termed quanternion-domain super multi-dimensional scaling (QD-SMDS). The algorithm is based on a reformulation of the SMDS, originally developed in the real domain, using quaternion algebra. By representing 3D coordinates as quaternions, the method constructs a rank-1 Gram edge kernel (GEK) matrix that integrates both relative distance and angular information between nodes, which enhances the noise reduction effect achieved through low-rank truncation employing singular value decomposition (SVD), thereby improving robustness against information loss. To further reduce computational complexity, we also propose a variant of QD-SMDS that eliminates the need for the computationally expensive SVD by leveraging the inherent structure of the quaternion-domain GEK matrix. This alternative directly estimates node coordinates using only matrix multiplications within the quaternion domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves localization accuracy compared to the original SMDS algorithm, especially in scenarios with substantial measurement errors. The proposed method also achieves comparable localization accuracy without requiring SVD.</description>

      <title>Sensor Drift Compensation in Electronic-Nose-Based Gas Recognition Using Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to environmental changes and sensor aging, sensor drift challenges the performance of electronic nose systems in gas classification during real-world deployment. Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset reported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical experimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing class-related variance.To address these limitations and improve sensor drift compensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation tasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to predict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and predicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous training data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three methods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark method Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method KD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset. We showed that KD consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA, achieving up to an 18% improvement in accuracy and 15% in F1-score, demonstrating KD's superior effectiveness in drift compensation. This is the first application of KD for electronic nose drift mitigation, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art DRCA method and enhancing the reliability of sensor drift compensation in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>High-Density EEG Enables the Fastest Visual Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology establishes a direct communication pathway between the brain and external devices. Current visual BCI systems suffer from insufficient information transfer rates (ITRs) for practical use. Spatial information, a critical component of visual perception, remains underexploited in existing systems because the limited spatial resolution of recording methods hinders the capture of the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of brain signals. This study proposed a frequency-phase-space fusion encoding method, integrated with 256-channel high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, to develop high-speed BCI systems. In the classical frequency-phase encoding 40-target BCI paradigm, the 256-66, 128-32, and 64-21 electrode configurations brought theoretical ITR increases of 83.66%, 79.99%, and 55.50% over the traditional 64-9 setup. In the proposed frequency-phase-space encoding 200-target BCI paradigm, these increases climbed to 195.56%, 153.08%, and 103.07%. The online BCI system achieved an average actual ITR of 472.7 bpm. This study demonstrates the essential role and immense potential of high-density EEG in decoding the spatiotemporal information of visual stimuli.</description>

      <title>To Trust or Not to Trust: On Calibration in ML-based Resource Allocation for Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast, when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system. Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver mobility.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Private Information Retrieval (SPIR) on Graph-Based Replicated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) on replicated databases modeled by a simple graph. In this model, each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers if and only if there is an edge between them. We consider the setting where the server-side common randomness necessary to accomplish SPIR is also replicated at the servers according to the graph, and we call this as message-specific common randomness. In this setting, we establish a lower bound on the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum download rate, for general graphs, by proposing an achievable SPIR scheme. Next, we prove that, for any SPIR scheme to be feasible, the minimum size of message-specific randomness should be equal to the size of a message. Finally, by providing matching upper bounds, we derive the exact SPIR capacity for the class of path and regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Blind Source Separation of Single-Channel Mixtures via Multi-Encoder Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of blind source separation (BSS) involves separating sources from a mixture without prior knowledge of the sources or the mixing system. Single-channel mixtures and non-linear mixtures are a particularly challenging problem in BSS. In this paper, we propose a novel method for addressing BSS with single-channel non-linear mixtures by leveraging the natural feature subspace specialization ability of multi-encoder autoencoders. During the training phase, our method unmixes the input into the separate encoding spaces of the multi-encoder network and then remixes these representations within the decoder for a reconstruction of the input. Then to perform source inference, we introduce a novel encoding masking technique whereby masking out all but one of the encodings enables the decoder to estimate a source signal. To this end, we also introduce a sparse mixing loss that encourages sparse remixing of source encodings throughout the decoder and a so-called zero reconstruction loss on the decoder for coherent source estimations. To analyze and evaluate our method, we conduct experiments on a toy dataset, designed to demonstrate this property of feature subspace specialization, and with real-world biosignal recordings from a polysomnography sleep study for extracting respiration from electrocardiogram and photoplethysmography signals.</description>

      <title>AI and Deep Learning for Terahertz Ultra-Massive MIMO: From Model-Driven Approaches to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explored the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing the challenges posed by terahertz ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems. It begins by outlining the characteristics of terahertz UM-MIMO systems and identifies three primary challenges for transceiver design: computational complexity, modeling difficulty, and measurement limitations. The study posits that AI provides a promising solution to these challenges. Three systematic research roadmaps are proposed for developing AI algorithms tailored to terahertz UM-MIMO systems. The first roadmap, model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes the importance of leveraging available domain knowledge and advocates the adoption of AI only to enhance bottleneck modules within an established signal processing or optimization framework. Four essential steps are discussed: algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss-function design, and neural architecture design. The second roadmap presents channel state information (CSI) foundation models, aimed at unifying the design of different transceiver modules by focusing on their shared foundation, that is, the wireless channel. The training of a single compact foundation model is proposed to estimate the score function of wireless channels, which serve as a versatile prior for designing a wide variety of transceiver modules. Four essential steps are outlined: general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, joint design of CSI foundation models, and model-driven DL. The third roadmap aims to explore potential directions for applying pretrained large language models (LLMs) to terahertz UM-MIMO systems. Several application scenarios are envisioned, including LLM-based estimation, optimization, search, network management, and protocol understanding. Finally, the study highlights open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexible-antenna systems have recently attracted significant research attention due to their potential to intelligently reconfigure wireless channels. However, the current flexible-antenna systems still suffer from fundamental limitations, such as free-space path loss and line-of-sight blockage. This article introduces a novel flexible-antenna system, termed the Pinching-Antenna SyStem (PASS). PASS adopts the dielectric waveguides as the primary transmission medium and radiates signals into free space by flexibly pinching discrete dielectric particles, referred to as pinching antennas, along the waveguide. By combining the strengths of both wireless and wired communication, PASS effectively mitigates inherent wireless limitations while offering high antenna reconfigurability. This article reviews the key features of PASS in comparison with conventional wireless systems, analyzes its main advantages, and discusses potential designs, transmission architectures, and application scenarios. Finally, it outlines promising research directions and open challenges associated with PASS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Source enumeration typically relies on subspace-based techniques that require accurate separation of signal and noise subspaces. However, prior works do not address coherent sources in small uniform linear arrays, where ambiguities arise in the spatial spectrum. We address this by decomposing the forward-backward smoothed covariance matrix into a sum of a rank-constrained Toeplitz matrix and a diagonal matrix with non-negative entries representing the signal and noise subspaces, respectively. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved by proposing Toeplitz approach for rank-based target estimation (TARgEt) that employs the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TARgEt over the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications. However, the performance of RIS-assisted systems critically depends on accurate channel state information (CSI). To address this challenge, this letter proposes a novel channel estimation method for RIS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems based on diffusion models (DMs). Specifically, the forward diffusion process of the original signal is formulated to model the received signal as a noisy observation within the framework of DMs. Subsequently, the channel estimation task is formulated as the reverse diffusion process, and a sampling algorithm based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) is developed to enable effective inference. Furthermore, a lightweight neural network, termed BRCNet, is introduced to replace the conventional U-Net, significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity. Extensive experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel and interpretable framework for electrocardiogram (ECG)-based disease detection that combines hyperdimensional computing (HDC) with learnable neural encoding. Unlike conventional HDC approaches that rely on static, random projections, our method introduces a rhythm-aware and trainable encoding pipeline based on RR intervals, a physiological signal segmentation strategy that aligns with cardiac cycles. The core of our design is a neural-distilled HDC architecture, featuring a learnable RR-block encoder and a BinaryLinear hyperdimensional projection layer, optimized jointly with cross-entropy and proxy-based metric loss. This hybrid framework preserves the symbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving 73.09\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable robustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable and personalized health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-based Speed of Sound Recovery for Aberration-Corrected Photoacoustic Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality, similar to ultrasound, with wide-ranging medical applications. Conventional PACT images are degraded by wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue. Accounting for these effects can improve image quality and provide medically useful information, but measuring the SOS directly is burdensome and the existing joint reconstruction method is computationally expensive. Traditional supervised learning techniques are currently inaccessible in this data-starved domain. In this work, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised joint reconstruction method that recovers SOS and high-quality images for ring array PACT systems. To solve this semi-blind inverse problem, we parametrize the SOS using either a pixel grid or a neural field (NF) and update it directly by backpropagating the gradients through a differentiable imaging forward model. Our method removes SOS aberrations more accurately and 35x faster than the current SOTA. We demonstrate the success of our method quantitatively in simulation and qualitatively on experimentally-collected and in vivo data. Our code and synthetic numerical phantoms are available on our project page: https://lukeli0425.github.io/Coord-SoS-PACT/.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Seasickness through Brain-Computer Interface-based Attention Shift</title>

Abstract: Seasickness poses a widespread problem that adversely impacts both passenger comfort and the operational efficiency of maritime crews. Although attention shift has been proposed as a potential method to alleviate symptoms of motion sickness, its efficacy remains to be rigorously validated, especially in maritime environments. In this study, we develop an AI-driven brain-computer interface (BCI) to realize sustained and practical attention shift by incorporating tasks such as breath counting. Forty-three participants completed a real-world nautical experiment consisting of a real-feedback session, a resting session, and a pseudo-feedback session. Notably, 81.39\% of the participants reported that the BCI intervention was effective. EEG analysis revealed that the proposed system can effectively regulate motion sickness EEG signatures, such as an decrease in total band power, along with an increase in theta relative power and a decrease in beta relative power. Furthermore, an indicator of attentional focus, the theta/beta ratio, exhibited a significant reduction during the real-feedback session, providing further evidence to support the effectiveness of the BCI in shifting attention. Collectively, this study presents a novel nonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, which has the potential to open up a brand-new application domain for BCIs.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Ray Tracing-Based Wireless Channels Generation for Real-Time Network Digital Twins</title>

Abstract: Ray tracing (RT) simulation is a widely used approach to enable modeling wireless channels in applications such as network digital twins. However, the computational cost to execute ray tracing (RT) is proportional to factors such as the level of detail used in the adopted 3D scenario. This work proposes RT pre-processing algorithms that aim at simplifying the 3D scene without distorting the channel, by reducing the scenario area and/or simplifying object shapes in the scenario. It also proposes a post-processing method that augments a set of RT results to achieve an improved time resolution. These methods enable using RT in applications that use a detailed and photorealistic 3D scenario while generating consistent wireless channels over time. Our simulation results with different urban scenarios scales, in terms of area and object details, demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the simulation time by more than 50% without compromising the accuracy of the multipath RT parameters, such as angles of arrival and departure, delay, phase, and path gain.</description>

      <title>Correct Estimation of Higher-Order Spectra: From Theoretical Challenges to Practical Multi-Channel Implementation in SignalSnap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01231</link>

Abstract: Higher-order spectra (Brillinger's polyspectra) offer powerful methods for solving critical problems in signal processing and data analysis. Despite their significant potential, their practical use has remained limited due to unresolved mathematical issues in spectral estimation, including the absence of unbiased and consistent estimators and the high computational cost associated with evaluating multidimensional spectra. Consequently, existing tools frequently produce artifacts, no existing software library correctly implements Brillinger's cumulant-based trispectrum, or fail to scale effectively to real-world data volumes, leaving crucial applications like multi-detector spectral analysis largely unexplored. In this paper, we revisit higher-order spectra from a modern perspective, addressing the root causes of their historical underuse. We reformulate higher-order spectral estimation using recently derived multivariate k-statistics, yielding unbiased and consistent estimators that eliminate spurious artifacts and precisely align with Brillinger's theoretical definitions. Our methodology covers single- and multi-channel spectral analysis up to the bispectrum (third order) and trispectrum (fourth order), enabling robust investigations of inter-frequency coupling, non-Gaussian behavior, and time-reversal symmetry breaking. Additionally, we introduce quasi-polyspectra to uncover non-stationary, time-dependent higher-order features. We implement these new estimators in SignalSnap, an open-source GPU-accelerated library capable of efficiently analyzing datasets exceeding hundreds of gigabytes within minutes. In applications such as continuous quantum measurements, SignalSnap's rigorous estimators enable precise quantitative matching between experimental data and theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Channel: Multichannel Signal Imaging for PPG-to-ECG Reconstruction with Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21767</link>

Abstract: Reconstructing ECG from PPG is a promising yet challenging task. While recent advancements in generative models have significantly improved ECG reconstruction, accurately capturing fine-grained waveform features remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose a novel PPG-to-ECG reconstruction method that leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the core network. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on single-channel PPG, our method employs a four-channel signal image representation, incorporating the original PPG, its first-order difference, second-order difference, and area under the curve. This multi-channel design enriches feature extraction by preserving both temporal and physiological variations within the PPG. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism in ViT, our approach effectively captures both inter-beat and intra-beat dependencies, leading to more robust and accurate ECG reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing 1D convolution-based approaches, achieving up to 29% reduction in PRD and 15% reduction in RMSE. The proposed approach also produces improvements in other evaluation metrics, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in reconstructing ECG signals. Furthermore, to ensure a clinically relevant evaluation, we introduce new performance metrics, including QRS area error, PR interval error, RT interval error, and RT amplitude difference error. Our findings suggest that integrating a four-channel signal image representation with the self-attention mechanism of ViT enables more effective extraction of informative PPG features and improved modeling of beat-to-beat variations for PPG-to-ECG mapping. Beyond demonstrating the potential of PPG as a viable alternative for heart activity monitoring, our approach opens new avenues for cyclic signal analysis and prediction.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided Latent Space Alignment for Semantic Channel Equalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.</description>
