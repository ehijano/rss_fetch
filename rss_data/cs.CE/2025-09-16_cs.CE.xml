      <title>Mechanics-Informed Machine Learning for Geospatial Modeling of Soil Liquefaction: Global and National Surrogate Models for Simulation and Near-Real-Time Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using machine learning (ML), high performance computing, and a large body of geospatial information, we develop surrogate models to predict soil liquefaction across regional scales. Two sets of models - one global and one specific to New Zealand - are trained by learning to mimic geotechnical models at the sites of in-situ tests. Our geospatial approach has conceptual advantages in that predictions: (i) are anchored to mechanics, which encourages more sensible response and scaling across the domains of soil, site, and loading characteristics; (ii) are driven by ML, which allows more predictive information to be used, with greater potential for it to be exploited; (iii) are geostatistically updated by subsurface data, which anchors the predictions to known conditions; and (iv) are precomputed everywhere on earth for all conceivable earthquakes, which allows the models to be executed very easily, thus encouraging user adoption and evaluation. Test applications suggest that: (i) the proposed models outperform others to a statistically significant degree; (ii) the geostatistical updating further improves performance; and (iii) the anticipated advantages of region-specific models may largely be negated by the benefits of learning from larger global datasets. These models are best suited for regional-scale liquefaction hazard simulation and near-real-time response and are accompanied by variance products that convey where, and to what degree, the ML-predicted liquefaction response is influenced by local geotechnical data.</description>

      <title>Geospatial AI for Liquefaction Hazard and Impact Forecasting: A Demonstrative Study in the U.S. Pacific Northwest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large-magnitude earthquakes have demonstrated the damaging consequences of soil liquefaction and reinforced the need to understand and plan for liquefaction hazards at a regional scale. In the United States, the Pacific Northwest is uniquely vulnerable to such consequences given the potential for crustal, intraslab, and subduction zone earthquakes. In this study, the liquefaction hazard is predicted geospatially at high resolution and across regional scales for 85 scenario earthquakes in the states of Washington and Oregon. This is accomplished using an emergent geospatial model that is driven by machine learning, and which predicts the probability of damaging ground deformation by surrogating state-of-practice geotechnical models. The adopted model shows improved performance and has conceptual advantages over prior regional-scale modeling approaches in that predictions (i) are informed by mechanics, (ii) employ more geospatial information using machine learning, and (iii) are geostatistically anchored to known subsurface conditions. The utility of the resulting predictions for the 85 scenarios is then demonstrated via asset and network infrastructure vulnerability assessments. The liquefaction hazard forecasts are published in a GIS-ready, public repository and are suitable for disaster simulations, evacuation route planning, network vulnerability analysis, land-use planning, insurance loss modeling, hazard communication, public investment prioritization, and other regional-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Why "AI" Models for Predicting Soil Liquefaction have been Ignored, Plus Some that Shouldn't Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil liquefaction remains an important and interesting problem that has attracted the development of enumerable prediction models. Increasingly, these models are utilizing algorithmic learning, or "artificial intelligence" (AI). The rapid growth of AI in the liquefaction literature is unsurprising, given its ease of implementation and potential advantages over traditional statistical methods. However, AI liquefaction models have been widely ignored by practitioners and researchers alike; the objective of this paper is to investigate "why?" Through a sample review of 75 publications, we identify several good reasons. Namely, these models frequently: (i) are not compared to state-of-practice models, making it unclear why they should be adopted; (ii) depart from best practices in model development; (iii) use AI in ways that may not be useful; (iv) are presented in ways that overstate their complexity and make them unapproachable; and (v) are discussed but not actually provided, meaning that no one can use the models even if they wanted to. These prevailing problems must be understood, identified, and remedied, but this does not mean that AI itself is problematic, or that all prior efforts have been without merit or utility. Instead, understanding these recurrent shortcomings can help improve the direction and perceptions of this growing body of work. Towards this end, we highlight papers that are generally free from these shortcomings, and which demonstrate applications where AI is more likely to provide value in the near term: permitting new modeling approaches and potentially improving predictions of liquefaction phenomena.</description>

      <title>Large language model-empowered next-generation computer-aided engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software development has entered a new era where large language models (LLMs) now serve as general-purpose reasoning engines, enabling natural language interaction and transformative applications across diverse domains. This paradigm is now extending into computer-aided engineering (CAE). Recent applications of LLMs in CAE have successfully automated routine tasks, including CAD model generation and FEM simulations. Nevertheless, these contributions, which primarily serve to reduce manual labor, are often insufficient for addressing the significant computational challenges posed by large-scale, high-dimensional systems. To this aim, we first introduce the concept of LLM-empowered CAE agent, where LLMs act as autonomous collaborators that plan, execute, and adapt CAE workflows. Then, we propose an LLM-empowered CAE agent for data-free model order reduction (MOR), a powerful yet underused approach for ultra-fast large-scale parametric analysis due to the intrusive nature and labor-intensive redevelopment of solvers. LLMs can alleviate this barrier by automating derivations, code restructuring, and implementation, making intrusive MOR both practical and broadly accessible. To demonstrate feasibility, we present an LLM-empowered CAE agent for solving ultra-large-scale space-parameter-time (S-P-T) physical problems using Tensor-decomposition-based A Priori Surrogates (TAPS). Our results show that natural language prompts describing parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) can be translated into efficient solver implementations, substantially reducing human effort while producing high-fidelity reduced-order models. Moreover, LLMs can synthesize novel MOR solvers for unseen cases such as nonlinear and high-dimensional parametric problems based on their internal knowledge base. This highlights the potential of LLMs to establish the foundation for next-generation CAE systems.</description>

      <title>Toward lean industry 5.0: a human-centered model for integrating lean and industry 4.0 in an automotive supplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a human-centered conceptual model integrating lean and Industry 4.0 based on the literature review and validated it through a case study in the context of an advanced automotive first-tier supplier. Addressing a significant gap in existing research on lean Industry 4.0 implementations, the study provides both theoretical insights and practical findings. It emphasizes the importance of a human-centered approach, identifies key enablers and barriers. In the implementation process of the case study, it is considered at group level and model site level through operational, social and technological perspectives in a five-phase multi-method approach. It shows what effective human-centered lean Industry 4.0 implementation look like and how advanced lean tools can be digitized. It highlights 26 positive and 10 negative aspects of the case and their causal relation. With the appropriate internal and external technological knowhow and people skills, it shows how successful implementation can benefit the organization and employees based on the conceptual model that serves as a first step toward lean Industry 5.0.</description>

      <title>Very-low-field MRI scanners: from the ideal to the real permanent magnet array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very-low-field MRIs are becoming increasingly popular due to their portability and adaptability to different environments. They are being successfully used for various clinical applications, leading to a paradigm shift in the way imaging care is typically performed. The development of low-cost MRI scanner prototypes began a few years ago, with some interesting and promising open-source projects emerging in both hardware and software design. Using permanent magnets (PMs) to generate the static magnetic field B0 can substantially reduce the manufacturing cost of low-field scanners while achieving satisfactory homogeneity. This article focuses on characterizing magnet performance in terms of B0 spatial homogeneity. Specifically, it investigates its sensitivity to various factors and explores the reasons for discrepancies between numerical expectations and actual measurements on fabricated magnets. The analysis also examines the consequences of using different numerical model approximations, revisiting concepts most frequently used in other design contexts. While these assumptions simplify the numerical model and may improve its performance in terms of computational time, this paper demonstrates that they also impact the reliability of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Hetero-EUCLID: Interpretable model discovery for heterogeneous hyperelastic materials using stress-unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a computational framework, Hetero-EUCLID, for segmentation and parameter identification to characterize the full hyperelastic behavior of all constituents of a heterogeneous material. In this work, we leverage the Bayesian-EUCLID (Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery) framework to efficiently solve the heterogenized formulation through parsimonious model selection using sparsity-promoting priors and Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling. We utilize experimentally observable 3D surface displacement and boundary-averaged force data generated from Finite Element simulations of non-equi-biaxial tension tests on heterogeneous specimens. The framework broadly consists of two steps -- residual force-based segmentation, and constitutive parameter identification. We validate and demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to segment the domain, and characterize the constituent materials on various types of thin square heterogeneous domains. We validate of the framework's ability to segment and characterize materials with various levels of displacement noises and non-native mesh discretizations, i.e, using different meshes for the forward FE simulations and the inverse EUCLID problem. This demonstrates Hetero-EUCLID framework's applicability in Digital Image/Volume Correlation-based experimental scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed framework performs successful segmentation and material characterizations based on data from a single experiment, thereby making it viable for rapid, interpretable model discovery in domains such as aerospace and defense composites and for characterization of selective tissue stiffening in medical conditions such as fibroatheroma, atherosclerosis, or cancer.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of fluid estimation for source terms in neutral particles simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In plasma edge simulations, kinetic Monte Carlo (MC) is often used to simulate neutral particles and estimate source terms. For large-sized reactors, like ITER and DEMO, high particle collision rates lead to a substantial computational cost for such schemes. To address this challenge, an asymptotic-preserving kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) simulation method and a corresponding fluid estimation technique have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we perform numerical analysis on the convergence of KDMC with the fluid estimation. To do so, we compare the accuracy of the analyzed algorithm with the accuracy of an approximate fluid method using the kinetic MC method as a reference. In a one-dimensional test case, KDMC with the fluid estimation achieves at least one order of magnitude lower errors than the fluid method for both high- and low-collisional regimes. Moreover, KDMC with the fluid estimation outperforms the kinetic MC method with a clear speed-up. Overall, our analysis confirms the effectiveness of the discussed algorithm.</description>

      <title>FinGEAR: Financial Mapping-Guided Enhanced Answer Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial disclosures such as 10-K filings present challenging retrieval problems due to their length, regulatory section hierarchy, and domain-specific language, which standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models underuse. We introduce FinGEAR (Financial Mapping-Guided Enhanced Answer Retrieval), a retrieval framework tailored to financial documents. FinGEAR combines a finance lexicon for Item-level guidance (FLAM), dual hierarchical indices for within-Item search (Summary Tree and Question Tree), and a two-stage cross-encoder reranker. This design aligns retrieval with disclosure structure and terminology, enabling fine-grained, query-aware context selection. Evaluated on full 10-Ks with queries aligned to the FinQA dataset, FinGEAR delivers consistent gains in precision, recall, F1, and relevancy, improving F1 by up to 56.7% over flat RAG, 12.5% over graph-based RAGs, and 217.6% over prior tree-based systems, while also increasing downstream answer accuracy with a fixed reader. By jointly modeling section hierarchy and domain lexicon signals, FinGEAR improves retrieval fidelity and provides a practical foundation for high-stakes financial analysis.</description>

      <title>Designing MacPherson Suspension Architectures using Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering design is traditionally performed by hand: an expert makes design proposals based on past experience, and these proposals are then tested for compliance with certain target specifications. Testing for compliance is performed first by computer simulation using what is called a discipline model. Such a model can be implemented by a finite element analysis, multibody systems approach, etc. Designs passing this simulation are then considered for physical prototyping. The overall process may take months, and is a significant cost in practice. We have developed a Bayesian optimization system for partially automating this process by directly optimizing compliance with the target specification with respect to the design parameters. The proposed method is a general framework for computing a generalized inverse of a high-dimensional non-linear function that does not require e.g. gradient information, which is often unavailable from discipline models. We furthermore develop a two-tier convergence criterion based on (i) convergence to a solution optimally satisfying all specified design criteria, or (ii) convergence to a minimum-norm solution. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a vehicle chassis design problem motivated by an industry setting using a state-of-the-art commercial discipline model. We show that the proposed approach is general, scalable, and efficient, and that the novel convergence criteria can be implemented straightforwardly based on existing concepts and subroutines in popular Bayesian optimization software packages.</description>

      <title>Retrosynthesis Planning via Worst-path Policy Optimisation in Tree-structured MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available building blocks, forming a synthesis tree where each internal node represents an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this formulation admits a unique optimal solution and offers monotonic improvement guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated advantage. Empirically, InterRetro achieves state-of-the-art results, solving 100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by 4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data - representing a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning.</description>

      <title>AttnBoost: Retail Supply Chain Sales Insights via Gradient Boosting Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting product demand in retail supply chains presents a complex challenge due to noisy, heterogeneous features and rapidly shifting consumer behavior. While traditional gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) offer strong predictive performance on structured data, they often lack adaptive mechanisms to identify and emphasize the most relevant features under changing conditions. In this work, we propose AttnBoost, an interpretable learning framework that integrates feature-level attention into the boosting process to enhance both predictive accuracy and explainability. Specifically, the model dynamically adjusts feature importance during each boosting round via a lightweight attention mechanism, allowing it to focus on high-impact variables such as promotions, pricing, and seasonal trends. We evaluate AttnBoost on a large-scale retail sales dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms standard machine learning and deep tabular models, while also providing actionable insights for supply chain managers. An ablation study confirms the utility of the attention module in mitigating overfitting and improving interpretability. Our results suggest that attention-guided boosting represents a promising direction for interpretable and scalable AI in real-world forecasting applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Temporal Fusion Transformers for Cryptocurrency Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise short-term price prediction in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market is critical for informed trading strategies. Although Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) have shown potential, their direct use often struggles in the face of the market's non-stationary nature and extreme volatility. This paper introduces an adaptive TFT modeling approach leveraging dynamic subseries lengths and pattern-based categorization to enhance short-term forecasting. We propose a novel segmentation method where subseries end at relative maxima, identified when the price increase from the preceding minimum surpasses a threshold, thus capturing significant upward movements, which act as key markers for the end of a growth phase, while potentially filtering the noise. Crucially, the fixed-length pattern ending each subseries determines the category assigned to the subsequent variable-length subseries, grouping typical market responses that follow similar preceding conditions. A distinct TFT model trained for each category is specialized in predicting the evolution of these subsequent subseries based on their initial steps after the preceding peak. Experimental results on ETH-USDT 10-minute data over a two-month test period demonstrate that our adaptive approach significantly outperforms baseline fixed-length TFT and LSTM models in prediction accuracy and simulated trading profitability. Our combination of adaptive segmentation and pattern-conditioned forecasting enables more robust and responsive cryptocurrency price prediction.</description>

      <title>COVID-BLUeS -- A Prospective Study on the Value of AI in Lung Ultrasound Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a lightweight and non-invasive imaging technique, lung ultrasound (LUS) has gained importance for assessing lung pathologies. The use of Artificial intelligence (AI) in medical decision support systems is promising due to the time- and expertise-intensive interpretation, however, due to the poor quality of existing data used for training AI models, their usability for real-world applications remains unclear. In a prospective study, we analyze data from 63 COVID-19 suspects (33 positive) collected at Maastricht University Medical Centre. Ultrasound recordings at six body locations were acquired following the BLUE protocol and manually labeled for severity of lung involvement. Several AI models were applied and trained for detection and severity of pulmonary infection. The severity of the lung infection, as assigned by human annotators based on the LUS videos, is not significantly different between COVID-19 positive and negative patients (p = 0.89). Nevertheless, the predictions of image-based AI models identify a COVID-19 infection with 65% accuracy when applied zero-shot (i.e., trained on other datasets), and up to 79% with targeted training, whereas the accuracy based on human annotations is at most 65%. Multi-modal models combining images and CBC improve significantly over image-only models. Although our analysis generally supports the value of AI in LUS assessment, the evaluated models fall short of the performance expected from previous work. We find this is due to 1) the heterogeneity of LUS datasets, limiting the generalization ability to new data, 2) the frame-based processing of AI models ignoring video-level information, and 3) lack of work on multi-modal models that can extract the most relevant information from video-, image- and variable-based inputs. To aid future research, we publish the dataset at: https://github.com/NinaWie/COVID-BLUES.</description>

      <title>M4GN: Mesh-based Multi-segment Hierarchical Graph Network for Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective surrogates for PDE simulations, yet their deep message passing incurs high cost and over-smoothing on large, long-range meshes; hierarchical GNNs shorten propagation paths but still face two key obstacles: (i) building coarse graphs that respect mesh topology, geometry, and physical discontinuities, and (ii) maintaining fine-scale accuracy without sacrificing the speed gained from coarsening. We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric hierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that pairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by modal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically consistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant aggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation approaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level GNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons efficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency. Evaluated on multiple representative benchmark datasets, M4GN improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster inference than state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>An Advanced Convolutional Neural Network for Bearing Fault Diagnosis under Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the area of bearing fault diagnosis, deep learning (DL) methods have been widely used recently. However, due to the high cost or privacy concerns, high-quality labeled data are scarce in real world scenarios. While few-shot learning has shown promise in addressing data scarcity, existing methods still face significant limitations in this domain. Traditional data augmentation techniques often suffer from mode collapse and generate low-quality samples that fail to capture the diversity of bearing fault patterns. Moreover, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields makes them inadequate for extracting global features from complex vibration signals. Additionally, existing methods fail to model the intricate relationships between limited training samples. To solve these problems, we propose an advanced data augmentation and contrastive fourier convolution framework (DAC-FCF) for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data. Firstly, a novel conditional consistent latent representation and reconstruction generative adversarial network (CCLR-GAN) is proposed to generate more diverse data. Secondly, a contrastive learning based joint optimization mechanism is utilized to better model the relations between the available training data. Finally, we propose a 1D fourier convolution neural network (1D-FCNN) to achieve a global-aware of the input data. Experiments demonstrate that DAC-FCF achieves significant improvements, outperforming baselines by up to 32\% on case western reserve university (CWRU) dataset and 10\% on a self-collected test bench. Extensive ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed components. Thus, the proposed DAC-FCF offers a promising solution for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reservoir Decision Support: An Integrated Framework Combining Large Language Models, Advanced Prompt Engineering, and Multimodal Data Fusion for Real-Time Petroleum Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The petroleum industry faces unprecedented challenges in reservoir management, requiring rapid integration of complex multimodal datasets for real-time decision support. This study presents a novel integrated framework combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4% well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions (mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period. Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and reduced environmental incidents by 45%. We provide detailed experimental protocols, baseline comparisons, ablation studies, and statistical significance testing to ensure reproducibility. This research demonstrates practical integration of cutting-edge AI technologies with petroleum domain expertise for enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and economic performance.</description>

      <title>Trading-R1: Financial Trading with LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing professional, structured reasoning on par with human financial analysts and traders remains a central challenge in AI for finance, where markets demand interpretability and trust. Traditional time-series models lack explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support disciplined and interpretable trading decisions. Trading-R1 Terminal will be released at https://github.com/TauricResearch/Trading-R1.</description>

      <title>Requirements for Early Quantum Advantage and Quantum Utility in the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a transparent, encoding-agnostic framework for determining when the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) can achieve early quantum advantage. Our analysis shows this is unlikely on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware even in best case scenarios that use the most qubit-efficient direct encodings. Closed-form resource counts, combined with recent device benchmarks, yield three decisive go/no-go figures of merit: the quantum feasibility point and the qubit- and gate-feasibility lines, which place any CVRP instance on a single decision diagram. Contrasting a direct QUBO mapping with a space-efficient higher-order (HOBO) encoding reveals a large gap. Applied to early-advantage benchmarks such as Golden-5, our diagram shows that HOBO circuits require only 7,685 qubits, whereas comparable QUBO encodings still exceed 200,000 qubits. In addition to identifying candidate instances for early quantum advantage in CVRP, the framework provides a unifying go/no-go metric that ingests any CVRP encoding together with any hardware profile and highlights when quantum devices could challenge classical heuristics. Quantum advantage in CVRP would likely require innovative problem decomposition techniques.</description>

      <title>AMLNet: A Knowledge-Based Multi-Agent Framework to Generate and Detect Realistic Money Laundering Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) research is constrained by the lack of publicly shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets. We present AMLNet, a knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\% laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering, integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage (Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset, indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal, network, behavioral) and release the dataset (Version 1.0, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736515), to advance reproducible and regulation-conscious AML experimentation.</description>

      <title>ProLLaMA: A Protein Large Language Model for Multi-Task Protein Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Protein Language Models (PLMs) have transformed protein engineering, yet unlike their counterparts in Natural Language Processing (NLP), current PLMs exhibit a fundamental limitation: they excel in either Protein Language Understanding (PLU) or Protein Language Generation (PLG), but rarely both. This fragmentation hinders progress in protein engineering. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProLLaMA, a multitask protein language model enhanced by the Evolutionary Protein Generation Framework (EPGF). We construct a comprehensive instruction dataset containing approximately 13 million samples with over 11,000 superfamily annotations to facilitate better modeling of sequence-function landscapes. We leverage a two-stage training approach to develop ProLLaMA, a multitask LLM with protein domain expertise. Our EPGF addresses the mismatch between statistic language modeling and biological constraints through three innovations: a multi-dimensional interpretable scorer, hierarchical efficient decoding, and a probabilistic-biophysical joint selection mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProLLaMA excels in both unconditional and controllable protein generation tasks, achieving superior structural quality metrics compared to existing PLMs. Additionally, ProLLaMA demonstrates strong understanding capabilities with a 67.1% exact match rate in superfamily prediction. EPGF significantly enhances the biological viability of generated sequences, as evidenced by improved biophysical scores (+4.3%) and structural metrics (+14.5%). The project is available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ProLLaMA.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Predicting the Next Targets of Activist Funds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research presents a predictive model to identify potential targets of activist investment funds--entities that acquire significant corporate stakes to influence strategic and operational decisions, ultimately enhancing shareholder value. Predicting such targets is crucial for companies aiming to mitigate intervention risks, activist funds seeking optimal investments, and investors looking to leverage potential stock price gains. Using data from the Russell 3000 index from 2016 to 2022, we evaluated 123 model configurations incorporating diverse imputation, oversampling, and machine learning techniques. Our best model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.782, demonstrating its capability to effectively predict activist fund targets. To enhance interpretability, we employed the Shapley value method to identify key factors influencing a company's likelihood of being targeted, highlighting the dynamic mechanisms underlying activist fund target selection. These insights offer a powerful tool for proactive corporate governance and informed investment strategies, advancing understanding of the mechanisms driving activist investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Plastic Arbor: a modern simulation framework for synaptic plasticity -- from single synapses to networks of morphological neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems. In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
  To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to support simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the extended framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that Arbor is highly efficient in terms of runtime and memory use as compared to other simulators. Using the extended framework, as an example, we investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, finding a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information. By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.</description>

      <title>Select2Drive: Pragmatic Communications for Real-Time Collaborative Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything communications-assisted autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with pragmatic communications (PragComm) emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time collaboration among vehicles and other agents. Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computation cost-efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the ``less is more" principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communications of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a $2.60$\% and $1.99$\% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most $8.35$\% and $2.65$\% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.</description>

      <title>An Agentic AI Workflow to Simplify Parameter Estimation of Complex Differential Equation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter identification for mechanistic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models underpins prediction and control in several applications, yet remains a manual and labor-intensive process: datasets are noisy and partial, models can be stiff and complex, and differentiable implementations demand framework expertise. An agentic AI workflow is presented that converts a lightweight, human-readable specification into a compiled, parallel, and differentiable model calibration pipeline. Users supply an XML description of the problem and fill in a Python code skeleton; the agent automatically validates consistency between problem definition and code, and auto-corrects pathologies in the input deck. It transforms Python callables into pure JAX functions for efficient just-in-time compilation and parallelization. The system then orchestrates a two-stage search comprising global exploration of the parameter space followed by gradient-based refinement. The result is an AD-native, reproducible workflow that lowers the barrier to advanced calibration while preserving expert control. An open-source implementation with a documented API and examples is released, enabling rapid movement from problem statement to interpretable ODE models with minimal effort.</description>

      <title>Quantifying model prediction sensitivity to model-form uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-form uncertainty (MFU) in assumptions made during physics-based model development is widely considered a significant source of uncertainty; however, there are limited approaches that can quantify MFU in predictions extrapolating beyond available data. As a result, it is challenging to know how important MFU is in practice, especially relative to other sources of uncertainty in a model, making it difficult to prioritize resources and efforts to drive down error in model predictions. To address these challenges, we present a novel method to quantify the importance of uncertainties associated with model assumptions. We combine parameterized modifications to assumptions (called MFU representations) with grouped variance-based sensitivity analysis to measure the importance of assumptions. We demonstrate how, in contrast to existing methods addressing MFU, our approach can be applied without access to calibration data. However, if calibration data is available, we demonstrate how it can be used to inform the MFU representation, and how variance-based sensitivity analysis can be meaningfully applied even in the presence of dependence between parameters (a common byproduct of calibration).</description>

      <title>QuantAgent: Price-Driven Multi-Agent LLMs for High-Frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in financial reasoning and market understanding. Multi-agent LLM frameworks such as TradingAgent and FINMEM augment these models to long-horizon investment tasks, leveraging fundamental and sentiment-based inputs for strategic decision-making. However, such systems are ill-suited for the high-speed, precision-critical demands of High-Frequency Trading (HFT). HFT requires rapid, risk-aware decisions based on structured, short-horizon signals, including technical indicators, chart patterns, and trend-based features, distinct from the long-term semantic reasoning typical of traditional financial LLM applications. To this end, we introduce QuantAgent, the first multi-agent LLM framework explicitly designed for high-frequency algorithmic trading. The system decomposes trading into four specialized agents, Indicator, Pattern, Trend, and Risk, each equipped with domain-specific tools and structured reasoning capabilities to capture distinct aspects of market dynamics over short temporal windows. In zero-shot evaluations across ten financial instruments, including Bitcoin and Nasdaq futures, QuantAgent demonstrates superior performance in both predictive accuracy and cumulative return over 4-hour trading intervals, outperforming random prediction baselines. Our findings suggest that combining structured financial priors with language-native reasoning unlocks new potential for traceable, real-time decision systems in high-frequency financial markets.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Democratize Access to Costly Datasets for Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unequal access to costly datasets essential for empirical research has long hindered researchers from disadvantaged institutions, limiting their ability to contribute to their fields and advance their careers. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under US $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.</description>

      <title>Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16974v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&amp;As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</description>

      <title>QUEST: QUantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.</description>

      <title>Accurate identification of communication between multiple interacting neural populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations, leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS), a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information processing.</description>
