      <title>Remarks on $q$-difference opers arising from quantum toroidal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a conjectural correspondence between the spectra of the Bethe algebra for the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra on relaxed Verma modules, and $q$-hypergeometric opers with apparent singularities. We introduce alongside the notion of apparent singularities for linear $q$-difference operators and discuss some of their properties. We also touch on a generalization to $\mathfrak{gl}_n$.</description>

      <title>Higher structures on homology groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We dualise the classical fact that an operad with multiplication leads to cohomology groups which form a Gerstenhaber algebra to the context of cooperads: as a result, a cooperad with comultiplication induces a homology theory that is endowed with the structure of a Gerstenhaber coalgebra, that is, it comes with a graded cocommutative coproduct which is compatible with a coantisymmetric cobracket in a dual Leibniz sense. As an application, one obtains Gerstenhaber coalgebra structures on Tor groups over bialgebras or Hopf algebras, as well as on Hochschild homology for Frobenius algebras.</description>

      <title>A survey on the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki invariant for closed 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the original approach to the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki (LMO) invariant of closed 3-manifolds (as opposed to the later approach based on the Aarhus integral). Following the ideas of surgery presentation, we introduce a class of combinatorial structures, called Kirby structures, which we prove to yield multiplicative 3-manifold invariants. We illustrate this with the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. We then introduce a class of combinatorial structures, called pre-LMO structures, and prove that they give rise to Kirby structures. We show how the Kontsevich integral can be used to construct a pre-LMO structure. This yields two families of multiplicative 3-manifolds invariants $\{\Omega_n^{\mathfrak{c}}\}_{n\geq 1}$ and $\{\Omega_n^{\mathfrak{d}}\}_{n\geq 1}$. We review the elimination of redundant information in the latter family, leading to the construction of the LMO invariant. We also provide uniqueness results of some aspects of the LMO construction. The family of invariants $\{\Omega_n^{\mathfrak{c}}\}_{n\geq 1}$ is not discussed explicitly in the literature; whereas $\Omega_n^{\mathfrak{c}}$ enables one to recover $\Omega_n^{\mathfrak{d}}$ for any $n \geq 1$, we show that these invariants coincide for $n = 1$.</description>

      <title>Reality determining subgraphs and strongly real modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of pseudo q-factorization graphs was recently introduced by the last two authors as a combinatorial language which is suited for capturing certain properties of Drinfeld polynomials. Using certain known representation theoretic facts about tensor products of Kirillov Reshetikhin modules and qcharacters, combined with special topological/combinatorial properties of the underlying q-factorization graphs, the last two authors showed that, for algebras of type A, modules associated to totally ordered graphs are prime, while those associated to trees are real. In this paper, we extend the latter result. We introduce the notions of strongly real modules and that of trees of modules satisfying certain properties. In particular, we can consider snake trees, i.e., trees formed from snake modules. Among other results, we show that a certain class of such generalized trees, which properly contains the snake trees, give rise to strongly real modules.</description>

      <title>Categories of Line Defects and Cohomological Hall Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any four-dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory with eight supercharges can be associated to a monoidal category of BPS line defects. Any Coulomb vacuum of such a theory can be conjecturally associated to an "algebra of BPS particles'', exemplified by certain Cohomological Hall Algebras. We conjecture the existence of a monoidal functor from the category of line defects to a certain category of bimodules for the BPS Algebra in any Coulomb vacuum. We describe images of simple objects under the conjectural functor and study their monoidal structure in examples. As we vary the choice of vacuum, we expect the collection of functors associated to any given theory to capture the full information of the original monoidal category of lines.</description>

      <title>Heat operators and isometry groups of Cuntz-Krieger algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces heat semigroups of topological Markov chains and Cuntz-Krieger algebras by means of spectral noncommutative geometry. Using recent advances on the logarithmic Dirichlet Laplacian on Ahlfors regular metric-measure spaces, we construct spectral triples on Cuntz-Krieger algebras from singular integral operators. These spectral triples exhaust K-homology and for Cuntz algebras we can compute their heat operators explicitly as Riesz potential operators. We also describe their isometry group in terms of the automorphism group of the underlying directed graph and prove that the Voiculescu noncommutative topological entropy vanishes on isometries.</description>

      <title>RE-algebras, quasi-determinants and the full Toda system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1991, Gelfand and Retakh embodied the idea of a noncommutative Dieudonne determinant in the case of RTT algebra, namely, they found a representation of the quantum determinant of RTT algebra in the form of a product of principal quasi-determinants. In this note we construct an analogue of the above statement for the RE-algebra corresponding to the Drinfeld R-matrix for the order $n=2,3$. Namely, we have found a family of quasi-determinants that are principal with respect to the antidiagonal, commuting among themselves, whose product turns out to be the quantum determinant of this algebra. This family generalizes the construction of integrals of the full Toda system due to Deift et al. for the quantum case of RE-algebras. In our opinion, this result also clarifies the role of RE-algebras as a quantum homogeneous spaces and can be used to construct effective quantum field theories with a boundary.</description>

      <title>Hodge structures on conformal blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of complex Hodge structures on modular functors, under the assumptions that their conformal blocks are semisimple as representations of mapping class groups and that the associated categories are ribbon. These $2$ assumptions are satisfied by modular functors coming from Lie algebras, and it is an open conjecture that they are always satisfied. The proof is based on the non-abelian Hodge correspondence and Ocneanu rigidity. Given a modular functor, we explain how its Hodge numbers fit into a Frobenius algebra and the Chern characters of its Hodge decompositions into a new cohomological field theory (CohFT). In the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ modular functors of level $2$ times an odd number, we give explicit formulas for all Hodge numbers, in any genus $g$.</description>

      <title>Quiver algebras and their representations for arbitrary quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quiver Yangians were originally defined for the quiver and superpotential from string theory on general toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and serve as BPS algebras of these systems. Their characters reproduce the unrefined BPS indices, which correspond to classical Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants. We generalize this construction in two directions. First, we show that this definition extends to arbitrary quivers with potentials. Second, we explain how to define the characters to incorporate the refined BPS indices, which correspond to motivic DT invariants. We focus on two main classes of quivers: the BPS quivers of 4D $N=2$ theories and the quivers from the knot-quiver correspondence. The entire construction allows for straightforward generalizations to trigonometric, elliptic, and generalized cohomologies.</description>

      <title>On the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for spin chains with simple $\mathfrak{g}$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for a closed, rational spin chain with $\mathfrak{g}$-symmetry for any simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Starting the nesting process by removing a single simple root from $\mathfrak{g}$, we use the residual $U(1)$ charge and the block Gauss decomposition of the $R$-matrix to derive many standard results in the Bethe ansatz, such as the nesting of Yangian algebras, and the AB commutation relation.</description>

      <title>Minimal W-algebras with non-admissible levels and intermediate Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Kawasetsu:2018irs}, Kawasetsu proved that the simple W-algebra associated with a minimal nilpotent element $W_{k}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite for $\mathfrak{g}=D_4,E_6,E_7,E_8$ with non-admissible level $k=-h^\vee/6$. In this paper, we study ${W}_{k}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ algebra for $\mathfrak{g}=E_6,E_7,E_8$ with non-admissible level $k=-h^\vee/6+1$. We determine all irreducible (Ramond twisted) modules, compute their characters and find coset constructions and Hecke operator interpretations. These W-algebras are closely related to intermediate Lie algebras and intermediate vertex subalgebras.</description>
