      <title>Simultaneous universal circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let phi be a pseudo-Anosov flow on a closed oriented atoroidal 3-manifold M. We show that if F is any taut foliation almost transverse to phi, then the action of pi_1(M) on the boundary of the flow space, together with a natural collection of explicitly described monotone maps, defines a universal circle for F in the sense of Thurston and Calegari-Dunfield.</description>

      <title>Alternating links on nonorientable surfaces and Klein-bottly alternating links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known for several decades that classical alternating links in the 3-sphere have nice hyperbolic geometric properties. Recent work generalises such results to give hyperbolic geometry of links with alternating projections onto any surface in very general 3-manifolds. However, the most general results require an orientable projection surface. In this paper, we extend to alternating links on nonorientable projection surfaces. As an application, we study Klein bottly alternating links in prism manifolds, which are a natural generalisation of Adams' toroidally alternating links in lens spaces.</description>

      <title>Liftable mapping class groups of regular abelian covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_g$ be the closed oriented surface of genus $g \geq 0$, and let $\mathrm{Mod}(S_g)$ be the mapping class group of $S_g$. For $g\geq 2$, we develop an algorithm to obtain a finite generating set for the liftable mapping class group $\mathrm{LMod}_p(S_g)$ of a regular abelian cover $p$ of $S_g$. A key ingredient of our method is a result that provides a generating set of a group $G$ acting on a connected graph $X$ such that the quotient graph $X/G$ is finite. As an application of our algorithm, when $k$ is prime, we provide a finite generating set for $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_2)$ for cyclic cover $p_k:S_{k+1}\to S_2$. Using the Birman-Hilden theory, when $k=2,3$ and $g=2$, we also obtain a finite generating set for the normalizer of the Deck transformation group of $p_k$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(S_{k+1})$. We conclude the paper with an application of our algorithm that gives a finite generating set for $\mathrm{LMod}_p(S_2)$, where $p:S_5\to S_2$ is a cover with deck transformation group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus \mathbb{Z}_2$.</description>

      <title>Grasper families of spheres in $S^2 \times D^2$ and barbell diffeomorphisms of $S^1\times S^2 \times I$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the fundamental group of framed circles in $S^1 \times D^3$ injects into the fundamental group of framed spheres in $S^2\times D^2$, so that the cokernel is the fundamental group of framed neat disks in $D^4$. In particular, grasper families of circles give rise to countably many nontrivial families of spheres. Ambient extensions of either of these two types of families induce the same barbell diffeomorphisms of $S^1\times S^2\times I$. We give two proofs that these diffeomorphisms are nontrivial and pairwise distinct. This implies infinite generation of the abelian group of isotopy classes of diffeomorphisms of $S^1\times S^2\times I$ that are pseudo-isotopic to the identity, recovering a result of Singh.</description>

      <title>Intersection norms on surfaces and Birkhoff cross sections</title>

      <description>arXiv:1604.06688v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every finite collection of curves on a surface, we define an associated (semi-)norm on the first homology group of the surface. The unit ball of the dual norm is the convex hull of its integer points. We give an interpretation of these points in terms of certain coorientations of the original collection of curves. Our main result is a classification statement: when the surface has constant curvature and the curves are geodesics, integer points in the interior of the dual unit ball classify isotopy classes of Birkhoff cross sections for the geodesic flow (on the unit tangent bundle to the surface) whose boundary is the symmetric lift of the collection of geodesics. Birkhoff cross sections in particular yield open-book decompositions of the unit tangent bundle.</description>

      <title>From curves to currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.01550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many natural real-valued functions of closed curves are known to extend continuously to the larger space of geodesic currents. For instance, the extension of length with respect to a fixed hyperbolic metric was a motivating example for the development of geodesic currents. We give a simple criterion on a curve function that guarantees a continuous extension to geodesic currents. The main condition of our criterion is the smoothing property, which has played a role in the study of systoles of translation lengths for Anosov representations. It is easy to see that our criterion is satisfied for almost all the known examples of continuous functions on geodesic currents, such as non-positively curved lengths or stable lengths for surface groups, while also applying to new examples like extremal length. We use this extension to obtain a new curve counting result for extremal length.</description>

      <title>Crushing Surfaces of Positive Genus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of crushing a normal surface has proven to be a powerful tool in computational $3$-manifold topology, with applications both to triangulation complexity and to algorithms. The main difficulty with crushing is that it can drastically change the topology of a triangulation, so applications to date have been limited to relatively simple surfaces: $2$-spheres, discs, annuli, and closed boundary-parallel surfaces. We give the first detailed analysis of the topological effects of crushing closed essential surfaces of positive genus. To showcase the utility of this new analysis, we use it to prove some results about how triangulation complexity interacts with JSJ decompositions and satellite knots; although similar applications can also be obtained using techniques of Matveev, our approach has the advantage that it avoids the machinery of almost simple spines and handle decompositions.</description>

      <title>Randomized Geodesic Flow on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Gromov's geodesic flow problem on hyperbolic groups $G$, we develop in this paper an analog using random walks. This leads to a notion of a harmonic analog $\Theta$ of the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\partial^2 G$. We provide three different but related constructions of $\Theta$: 1) by moving the base-point along a quasigeodesic ray 2) by moving the base-point along random walk trajectories 3) directly as a push-forward under the boundary map to $\partial^2 G$ of a measure inherited from studying all bi-infinite random walk trajectories (with no restriction on base-point) on $G^{\mathbb{Z}}$.
  Of these, the third construction is the most involved and needs new techniques. It relies on developing a framework where we can treat bi-infinite random walk trajectories as analogs of bi-infinite geodesics on complete simply connected negatively curved manifolds. Geodesic flow on a hyperbolic group is typically not well-defined due to non-uniqueness of geodesics. We circumvent this problem in the random walk setup by considering \emph{all} trajectories. We thus get a well-defined \emph{discrete flow} given by the $\mathbb{Z}-$shift on bi-infinite random walk trajectories. The $\mathbb{Z}-$shift is the random analog of the time one map of the geodesic flow. As an analog of ergodicity of the geodesic flow on a closed negatively curved manifold, we establish ergodicity of the $G$-action on $(\partial^2G, \Theta)$.</description>
