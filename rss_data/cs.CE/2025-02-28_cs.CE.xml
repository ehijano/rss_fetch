      <title>A hybrid framework integrating classical computers and quantum annealers for optimisation of truss structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid framework combining classical computers with quantum annealers for structural optimisation. At each optimisation iteration of an iterative process, two minimisation problems are formulated one for the underlying mechanical boundary value problem through the minimisation potential energy principle and one for the minimisation problem to update the design variables. Our hybrid approach leverages the strength of quantum computing to solve these two minimisation problems at each step, thanks to the developed quantum annealing-assisted sequential programming strategy introduced in [Nguyen, Wu, Remacle, and Noels. A quantum annealing-sequential quadratic programming assisted finite element simulation for non-linear and history-dependent mechanical problems. European Journal of Mechanics-A/Solids 105 (2024): 105254]. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated through several case studies of truss optimisation, highlighting its capability to perform optimisation with quantum computers. The proposed framework offers a promising direction for future structural optimisation applications, particularly in scenarios where the quantum computer could resolve the size limitations of the classical computers due to problem complexities.</description>

      <title>ChatMol: A Versatile Molecule Designer Based on the Numerically Enhanced Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal-oriented de novo molecule design, namely generating molecules with specific property or substructure constraints, is a crucial yet challenging task in drug discovery. Existing methods, such as Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning, often require training multiple property predictors and struggle to incorporate substructure constraints. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose ChatMol, a novel approach that leverages LLMs for molecule design across diverse constraint settings. Initially, we crafted a molecule representation compatible with LLMs and validated its efficacy across multiple online LLMs. Afterwards, we developed specific prompts geared towards diverse constrained molecule generation tasks to further fine-tune current LLMs while integrating feedback learning derived from property prediction. Finally, to address the limitations of LLMs in numerical recognition, we referred to the position encoding method and incorporated additional encoding for numerical values within the prompt. Experimental results across single-property, substructure-property, and multi-property constrained tasks demonstrate that ChatMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including VAE and RL-based methods. Notably, in multi-objective binding affinity maximization task, ChatMol achieves a significantly lower KD value of 0.25 for the protein target ESR1, while maintaining the highest overall performance, surpassing previous methods by 4.76%. Meanwhile, with numerical enhancement, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the instructed property values and those of the generated molecules increased by up to 0.49. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a versatile framework for molecule generation, offering a promising alternative to traditional latent space and RL-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Topology Optimization for Multi-Axis Additive Manufacturing Considering Overhang and Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology optimization produces designs with intricate geometries and complex topologies that require advanced manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing (AM). However, insufficient consideration of manufacturability during the optimization process often results in design modifications that compromise the optimality of the design. While multi-axis AM enhances manufacturability by enabling flexible material deposition in multiple orientations, challenges remain in addressing overhang structures, potential collisions, and material anisotropy caused by varying build orientations. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel space-time topology optimization framework for multi-axis AM. The framework employs a pseudo-time field as a design variable to represent the fabrication sequence, simultaneously optimizing the density distribution and build orientations. This approach ensures that the overhang angles remain within manufacturable limits while also mitigating collisions. Moreover, by incorporating material anisotropy induced by diverse build orientations into the design process, the framework can take the scan path-dependent structural behaviors into account during the design optimization. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively derives feasible and optimal designs that account for the manufacturing characteristics of multi-axis AM.</description>

      <title>How Much is Enough? The Diminishing Returns of Tokenization Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenization, a crucial initial step in natural language processing, is often assumed to benefit from larger training datasets. This paper investigates the impact of tokenizer training data sizes ranging from 1GB to 900GB. Our findings reveal diminishing returns as the data size increases, highlighting a practical limit on how much further scaling the training data can improve tokenization quality. We analyze this phenomenon and attribute the saturation effect to the constraints imposed by the pre-tokenization stage of tokenization. These results offer valuable insights for optimizing the tokenization process and highlight potential avenues for future research in tokenization algorithms.</description>

      <title>PhyMPGN: Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network for spatiotemporal PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) serves as a cornerstone for modeling complex dynamical systems. Recent progresses have demonstrated grand benefits of data-driven neural-based models for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics (e.g., tremendous speedup gain compared with classical numerical methods). However, most existing neural models rely on rich training data, have limited extrapolation and generalization abilities, and suffer to produce precise or reliable physical prediction under intricate conditions (e.g., irregular mesh or geometry, complex boundary conditions, diverse PDE parameters, etc.). To this end, we propose a new graph learning approach, namely, Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network (PhyMPGN), to model spatiotemporal PDE systems on irregular meshes given small training datasets. Specifically, we incorporate a GNN into a numerical integrator to approximate the temporal marching of spatiotemporal dynamics for a given PDE system. Considering that many physical phenomena are governed by diffusion processes, we further design a learnable Laplace block, which encodes the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator, to aid and guide the GNN learning in a physically feasible solution space. A boundary condition padding strategy is also designed to improve the model convergence and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhyMPGN is capable of accurately predicting various types of spatiotemporal dynamics on coarse unstructured meshes, consistently achieves the state-of-the-art results, and outperforms other baselines with considerable gains.</description>
