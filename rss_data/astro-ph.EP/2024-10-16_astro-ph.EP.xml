      <title>Water depletion and 15NH3 in the atmosphere of the coldest brown dwarf observed with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a temperature of $\sim 285$ K WISE0855 is the coldest brown dwarf observed so far. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we obtained observations that allow us to characterize WISE0855s atmosphere focusing on vertical variation in the water steam abundance, measuring trace gas abundances and receiving bulk parameters for this cold object. We observed the ultra cool dwarf WISE0855 using the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS) onboard JWST at a spectral resolution of up to 3750. We combined the observation with published data from the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) G395M and PRISM modes yielding a spectrum ranging from 0.8 to 22 um. We apply atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS to measure atmospheric abundances, the pressure-temperature structure, radius and gravity of the brown dwarf. We also employ publicly available clear and cloudy self-consistent grid models to estimate bulk properties of the atmosphere such as the effective temperature, radius, gravity and metallicity. Atmospheric retrievals constrain a variable water abundance profile in the atmosphere, as predicted by equilibrium chemistry. We detect the 15NH3 isotopologue and infer a ratio of mass fraction of 14NH3/15NH3 = 332+63-43 for the clear retrieval. We measure the bolometric luminosity by integrating the presented spectrum and obtain a value of log(L/L$_{\odot}$) = -7.291+/-0.008. The detected water depletion indicates that water condenses out in the upper atmosphere due to the very low effective temperature of WISE0855. The height in the atmosphere where this occurs is covered by the MIRI/MRS data, and thus demonstrates the potential of MIRI to characterize cold gas giants atmospheres. Comparing the data to retrievals and self-consistent grid models, we do not detect signs for water ice clouds, although their spectral features have been predicted in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Disequilibrium Chemistry, Diabatic Thermal Structure, and Clouds in the Atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Located 10.888 pc from Earth, COCONUTS-2b is a planetary-mass companion to a young (150--800 Myr) M3 star, with a wide orbital separation (6471 au) and a low companion-to-host mass ratio ($0.021\pm0.005$). We have studied the atmospheric properties of COCONUTS-2b using newly acquired 1.0--2.5~$\mu$m spectroscopy from Gemini/Flamingos-2. The spectral type of COCONUTS-2b is refined to T$9.5 \pm 0.5$ based on comparisons with T/Y dwarf spectral templates. We have conducted an extensive forward-modeling analysis, comparing the near-infrared spectrum and mid-infrared broadband photometry with sixteen state-of-the-art atmospheric model grids developed for brown dwarfs and self-luminous exoplanets near the T/Y transition. The \texttt{PH$_{3}$-free ATMO2020++}, \texttt{ATMO2020++}, and \texttt{Exo-REM} models best match the specific observations of COCONUTS-2b, regardless of variations in the input spectrophotometry. This analysis suggests the presence of disequilibrium chemistry, along with a diabatic thermal structure and/or clouds, in the atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b. All models predict fainter $Y$-band fluxes than observed, highlighting uncertainties in the alkali chemistry models and opacities. We determine a bolometric luminosity of $\log{(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot})}=-6.18$ dex, with a 0.5 dex-wide range of $[-6.43,-5.93]$ dex that accounts for various assumptions of models. Using thermal evolution models, we derive an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=483^{+44}_{-53}$ K, a surface gravity of $\log{(g)}=4.19^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ dex, a radius of $R=1.11^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, and a mass of $M=8 \pm 2$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. Various atmospheric model grids consistently indicate that COCONUTS-2b's atmosphere has sub- or near-solar metallicity and C/O. These findings provide valuable insights into COCONUTS-2b's formation history and the potential outward migration to its current wide orbit.</description>

      <title>Spin and Obliquity Evolution of Hot Jupiter Hosts from Resonance Locks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a hot Jupiter orbits a star whose effective temperature exceeds $\sim$6100 K, its orbit normal tends to be misaligned with the stellar spin axis. Cooler stars have smaller obliquities. The latter may have been damped by hot Jupiters in resonance lock with axisymmetric stellar gravity modes (azimuthal number $m=0$), as has been recently recognized. Here we allow for resonance locks with non-axisymmetric modes, which affect both stellar obliquity and spin frequency. Obliquities damp for all modes ($-2 \leq m \leq 2$). Stars spin up for $m &gt; 0$, and spin down for $m &lt; 0$. We carry out a population synthesis that assumes hot Jupiters form misaligned around both cool and hot stars, and subsequently lock onto modes whose $m$-values yield the highest mode energies for given starting obliquities. Core hydrogen burning enables hot Jupiters to torque low-mass stars, but not high-mass stars, into spin-orbit alignment. Resonance locking plus stellar spin-down from magnetic braking largely reproduces observed obliquities and stellar rotation rates and how they trend with stellar effective temperature and orbital separation.</description>

      <title>Streaming instabilities in accreting protoplanetary disks: A parameter study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The streaming instability (SI) is currently the leading candidate for triggering planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. Recently, a novel variation, the `azimuthal-drift' streaming instability (AdSI), was discovered in disks exhibiting laminar gas accretion. Unlike the classical SI, the AdSI does not require pressure gradients and can concentrate dust even at low abundances. We extend previous simulations of the AdSI to explore the impact of dust abundance, accretion flow strength, pressure gradients, and grain size. For a dimensionless accretion flow strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{M}}=0.1$ and particle Stokes number $\operatorname{St}=0.1$, we find the AdSI produces dust filaments for initial dust-to-gas ratios as low as $\epsilon=0.01$. For $\epsilon\gtrsim 1$, maximum dust-to-gas ratios of order 100 are attained, which can be expected to undergo gravitational collapse. Furthermore, even in systems dominated by the classical SI, an accretion flow drives filament formation, without which the disk remains in a state of small-scale turbulence. Our results suggest that an underlying accretion flow facilitates dust concentration and may thus promote planetesimal formation.</description>

      <title>Hic Sunt Dracones: Uncovering Dynamical Perturbers Within the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuing exploration of neighboring planetary systems is providing deeper insights into the relative prevalence of various system architectures, particularly with respect to the solar system. However, a full assessment of the dynamical feasibility of possible terrestrial planets within the Habitable Zones (HZ) of nearby stars requires detailed knowledge of the masses and orbital solutions of any known planets within these systems. Moreover, the presence of as yet undetected planets in or near the HZ will be crucial for providing a robust target list for future direct imaging surveys. In this work, we quantify the distribution of uncertainties on planetary masses and semi-major axes for 1062 confirmed planets, finding median uncertainties of 11.1% and 2.2%, respectively. We show the dependence of these uncertainties on stellar mass and orbital period, and discuss the effects of these uncertainties on dynamical analyses and the locations of mean motion resonance. We also calculate the expected radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude for a Neptune-mass planet in the middle of the HZ for each of the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory target stars. We find that for more than half of these stars, the RV semi-amplitude is less than 1.5 m/s, rendering them unlikely to be detected in archival RV data sets and highlighting the need for further observations to understand the dynamical viability of the HZ for these systems. We provide specific recommendations regarding stellar characterization and RV survey strategies that work toward the detection of presently unseen perturbers within the HZ.</description>

      <title>The Thermal Emission Spectrum of the Nearby Rocky Exoplanet LTT 1445A b from JWST MIRI/LRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby transiting rocky exoplanet LTT 1445A b presents an ideal target for studying atmospheric retention in terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs. It is cooler than many rocky exoplanets yet tested for atmospheres, receiving a bolometric instellation similar to Mercury's. Previous transmission spectroscopy ruled out a light H/He-dominated atmosphere but could not distinguish between a bare-rock, a high-MMW, or a cloudy atmosphere. We present new secondary eclipse observations using JWST's MIRI/LRS, covering the 5-12 $\mu$m range. From these observations, we detect a broadband secondary eclipse depth of 41 $\pm$ 9 ppm and measure a mid-eclipse timing consistent with a circular orbit (at 1.7$\sigma$). From its emission spectrum, the planet's dayside brightness temperature is constrained to 525 $\pm$ 15 K, yielding a temperature ratio relative to the maximum average dayside temperature from instant thermal reradiation by a rocky surface $R$ = $T_{\rm day,obs}/T_{\rm max}$ = 0.952 $\pm$ 0.057, consistent with emission from a dark rocky surface. From an energy balance perspective, such a warm dayside temperature disfavors thick atmospheres, excluding $\sim$100 bar atmospheres with Bond albedo $&gt;$ 0.08 at the 3$\sigma$ level. Furthermore, forward modeling of atmospheric emission spectra disfavor simple 100\% CO$_2$ atmospheres with surface pressures of 1, 10, and 100 bar at 4.2$\sigma$, 6.6$\sigma$, and 6.8$\sigma$ confidence, respectively. These results suggest that LTT 1445A b lacks a very thick CO$_2$ atmosphere, possibly due to atmospheric erosion driven by stellar activity. However, the presence of a moderately thin atmosphere (similar to those on Mars, Titan, or Earth) remains uncertain.</description>

      <title>TESS Giants Transiting Giants. VII. A Hot Saturn Orbiting an Oscillating Red Giant Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of TOI-7041 b (TIC 201175570 b), a hot Saturn transiting a red giant star with measurable stellar oscillations. We observe solar-like oscillations in TOI-7041 with a frequency of maximum power of $\nu_{\rm max} = 218.50\pm2.23$ $\mu$Hz and a large frequency separation of $\Delta\nu = 16.5282\pm0.0186$ $\mu$Hz. Our asteroseismic analysis indicates that TOI-7041 has a radius of $4.10 \pm 0.06$(stat) $\pm$ 0.05(sys) $R_\odot$, making it one of the largest stars around which a transiting planet has been discovered with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the mission's first oscillating red giant with a transiting planet. TOI-7041 b has an orbital period of $9.691 \pm 0.006$ days and a low eccentricity of $e = 0.04 \pm 0.04$. We measure a planet radius of $1.02 \pm 0.03$ $R_J$ with photometry from TESS, and a planet mass of $0.36 \pm 0.16$ $M_J$ ($114 \pm 51$ $M_\oplus$) with ground-based radial velocity measurements. TOI-7041 b appears less inflated than similar systems receiving equivalent incident flux, and its circular orbit indicates that it is not undergoing tidal heating due to circularization. The asteroseismic analysis of the host star provides some of the tightest constraints on stellar properties for a TESS planet host and enables precise characterization of the hot Saturn. This system joins a small number of TESS-discovered exoplanets orbiting stars that exhibit clear stellar oscillations and indicates that extended TESS observations of evolved stars will similarly provide a path to improved exoplanet characterization.</description>

      <title>Hot Rocks Survey I : A shallow eclipse for LHS 1478 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarf systems offer a unique opportunity to study terrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres due to their smaller size and cooler temperatures. However, due to the extreme conditions these host stars impose, it is unclear whether their small, close-in rocky planets are able to retain any atmosphere at all. The Hot Rocks Survey aims to answer this question by targeting nine different M dwarf rocky planets spanning a range of planetary and stellar properties. LHS 1478 b orbits an M3-type star, has an equilibrium temperature of Teq = 585 K and experiences an instellation 21 times greater than that of Earth. We observe two secondary eclipses using photometric imaging at 15 um using the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST MIRI) to measure thermal emission from the dayside of the planet. We then compare these values to different atmospheric scenarios to evaluate potential heat transport and CO2 absorption signatures. We find a secondary eclipse depth of 146 +/- 56 ppm based on the first observation, while the second observation results in a non-detection due to significantly larger unexplained systematics. Based on the first observation alone, we can reject the null hypothesis of the dark (zero Bond albedo) no atmosphere bare rock model with a confidence level of 3.4 sigma. For an airless body with a Bond albedo of A=0.2, the significance decreases to 2.9 sigma. The secondary eclipse depth is consistent with the majority of atmospheric scenarios we considered, which all involve atmospheres which include different concentrations of CO2, and surface pressures from 0.1 to 10 bar. However, we stress that the two observations from our program do not yield consistent results, and more observations are needed to verify our findings. The Hot Rocks Survey serves as a relevant primer for future endeavors such as the Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) Rocky Worlds program.</description>

      <title>An HST Transmission Spectrum of the Closest M-Dwarf Transiting Rocky Planet LTT 1445Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Which rocky exoplanets have atmospheres, and which do not? This presumably simply question is the first that must be answered in the pathway toward understanding the prevalence of nearby habitable planets. A mere 6.9 pc from Earth, the LTT 1445A system is the closest transiting M-dwarf system, and its largest known planet, at $\rm 1.31\; R_{\oplus}$ and 424 K, is one of the best rocky targets in which to search for an atmosphere. We use HST/WFC3 transmission spectroscopy with the G280 and G141 grisms to study the spectrum of LTT 1445Ab between $\rm 0.2-1.65\;\mu m$. In doing so, we uncover a flare on the neighboring star LTT 1445C, and report one of the first simultaneous near-UV/optical spectra of an M dwarf flare. The planet spectrum is consistent with a flat line, though the infrared portion displays potential features that could be explained by known opacity sources such as HCN. Some atmospheric retrievals weakly favor ($\sim2\sigma$) an atmosphere over a flat line, but it remains challenging to discern between stellar contamination, an atmosphere, and a featureless spectrum at this time. We do, however, confidently rule out $\leq100\times$ solar metallicity atmospheres. Although stellar contamination retrievals cannot fit the infrared features well, the overall spectrum is consistent with stellar contamination from hot spots, cold spots, or both. Based on the UV/optical data, we place limits on the extent of stellar variability expected in the near-infrared ($30-40$ ppm), which will be critical for upcoming JWST observations of this highly optimal target.</description>

      <title>Out of the Darkness: High-resolution Detection of CO Absorption on the Nightside of WASP-33b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed the ultra hot Jupiter WASP-33b with the Spectro-Polarim\`etre Infra-Rouge on the Canada Fance Hawaii Telescope. Previous observations of the dayside of WASP-33b show evidence of CO and Fe emission indicative of a thermal inversion. We observed its nightside over five Earth-nights to search for spectral signatures of CO in the planet's thermal emission. Our three pre-transit observations and two post-transit observations are sensitive to regions near the morning or evening terminators, respectively. From spectral retrievals, we detect CO molecular absorption in the planet's emission spectrum after transit at $\sim$6.6$\sigma$. This is the strongest ground-based detection of nightside thermal emission from an exoplanet, and only the third ever. CO appearing in absorption suggests that the nightside near the evening terminator does not have a temperature inversion; this makes sense if the dayside inversion is driven by absorption of stellar radiation. On the contrary, we do not detect CO from the morning terminator. This may be consistent with heat advection by an eastward jet. Phase-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy offers an economical alternative to space-based full-orbit spectroscopic phase curves for studying the vertical and horizontal atmospheric temperature profiles of short-period exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Sulfur in the Giant Planets, their Moons, and Extrasolar Gas Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review sulfur chemistry of the gas giant planets and their moons where sulfur compounds are observed. The major S-bearing gas in the upper atmospheres of the giant planets is H2S and is removed from their observable atmospheres by condensation into cloud layers (NH4SH on all four planets and additionally H2S ice on Uranus and Neptune). Any remaining H2S at higher altitudes is destroyed photochemically. Among the moons Io is the world dominated by sulfur. We summarize the sulfur cycle on Io and how pyrovolcanism is spreading sulfur across the Jovian system. Implantation of sulfur into icy surfaces of the other Galilean moons via magnetospheric transfer and radiolysis are major processes affecting the sulfur chemistry on their icy surfaces. On the icy worlds, we are literally looking at the top of the icebergs. Subsurface liquid salty bodies reveal themselves through cryovolcanism on Europa, Ganymede, and Enceladus, where salt deposits are indicated. Subsurface oceans are suspected on several other moons. We summarize the sulfur cycle for the icy Galilean moons. The occurrence of sulfates can be explained by salt exchange reactions of radiolytically produced H2SO4 with brine salts (carbonates and halides), or from a subsurface ocean that has become acidified by uptake of H2SO4 leaked from ice. In the primordial oceans of the moons that accreted with high ice rock ratios, sulfur is expected as sulfide and bisulfide anions and H2S in aqueous solution. Cosmochemical constraints suggest that pyrrhotite, tochilinite and green rusts could be important sulfide bearing compounds found with hydrous silicates such as serpentine, and magnetite on the sea floors. In N-C-rich worlds such as Titan, sulfides such as NH4SH and possibly thiazyl compounds could be important, and sulfates are unstable. Nothing is known about the sulfur chemistry on the Uranian and Neptunian moons.</description>

      <title>Planetary Mass Determinations from a Simplified Photodynamical Model -- Application To The Complete Kepler Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use PyDynamicaLC, a model using the least number of, and the least correlated, degrees of freedom needed to derive a photodynamical model, to describe some of the smallest -- and lowest TTV (transit timing variations) amplitude -- of the Kepler planets. We successfully analyze 64 systems containing 218 planets, for 88 of which we were able to determine significant masses (to better than $3\sigma$). We demonstrate consistency with literature results over two orders of magnitude in mass, and for the planets that already had literature mass estimations, we were able to reduce the relative mass error by $\sim22\%$ (median value). Of the planets with determined masses 23 are new mass determinations with no previous significant literature value, including a planet smaller and lighter than Earth (KOI-1977.02 / Kepler-345 b). These results demonstrate the power of photodynamical modeling with the appropriately chosen degrees of freedom. This will become increasingly more important as smaller planets are detected, especially as the TESS mission gathers ever longer-baseline light curves and for the analysis of the future PLATO mission data</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise Doppler method for measuring stellar radial velocities (RV) is a fundamental technique in modern astronomy. This method records a star's spectrum and detects periodic Doppler shifts in its spectral features, which indicate the gravitational influences induced by orbiting companions. The Doppler technique has yielded remarkable successes in exoplanet detection, uncovering a diverse array of planetary systems ranging from hot Jupiters to Neptune-mass planets and super-Earths. Having led to the discovery of over 1100 exoplanets, the RV method is the most effective approach for measuring orbital geometries and minimum masses, which are of fundamental importance when accessing planet formation and evolution scenarios. However, exoplanet detection via precise RV measurements poses significant challenges, including managing various sources of interference, such as instrumental errors, and mitigating spurious Doppler shifts induced by phenomena like stellar activity. Key to this technique's advancement is instrumental calibration methods, notably precise calibration methods and ultra-stable spectrographs. This technique holds promise in systematically exploring the domain of Jovian analogs, rocky and icy planets within the habitable zones of their parent stars, and providing crucial follow-up observations for transiting candidates detected by space missions. The synergy between transit and Doppler measurements of exoplanets, when feasible, has provided a comprehensive set of orbital and physical parameters for exoplanets, such as the dynamical mass and mean planet density, which is enhancing our understanding of their internal composition. Additionally, ongoing efforts aim to improve the RV technique further by developing more stable calibration techniques aimed at detecting Earth-like analogs around Solar-type stars that require cm/s RV precision.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric retrieval of Subaru/IRD high-resolution spectrum of the archetype T-type brown dwarf Gl 229 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs provide a unique opportunity to study atmospheres and their physical and chemical processes with high precision, especially in temperature ranges relevant to exoplanets. In this study, we performed high-resolution ($R \sim 70,000$) spectroscopy using Subaru/IRD of Gl 229 B, the first discovered T-type (T7.0p) brown dwarf, which orbits an M1V host star at a separation of 33 au. We conducted atmospheric retrieval on the reduced $H$-band spectrum using the high-resolution spectrum model compatible with automatic differentiation and GPU, ExoJAX. In contrast to previous retrieval studies on medium-resolution spectra, we obtained a C/O ratio consistent with that of the host star, aligning with the expected formation process for such a massive brown dwarf. Additionally, based on the strong constraint on temperature from the high-resolution spectrum and previously measured photometric magnitude, our analysis indicates that Gl 229 B is a binary, which was also proposed by Brandt et al. (2021). Finally, we validated current molecular line lists by leveraging the obtained high-precision, high-resolution spectrum of this warm ($\sim 900$ K) atmosphere. This study highlights the importance of observing companion brown dwarfs as benchmark objects for establishing characterization techniques for low-mass objects and enhancing our understanding of their atmospheres, given the wealth of available information and the relative ease of observation.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopically resolved partial phase curve of the rapid heating and cooling of the highly-eccentric Hot Jupiter HAT-P-2b with WFC3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme environments of transiting close-in exoplanets in highly-eccentric orbits are ideal for testing exo-climate physics. Spectroscopically resolved phase curves not only allow for the characterization of their thermal response to irradiation changes but also unveil phase-dependent atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. We observed a partial phase curve of the highly-eccentric close-in giant planet HAT-P-2b ($e=0.51,M=9M_{\rm{Jup}}$) with the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Using these data, we updated the planet's orbital parameters and radius, and retrieved high-frequency pulsations consistent with the planet-induced pulsations reported in Spitzer data. We found that the peak in planetary flux occurred at $6.7\pm0.6$ hr after periastron, with a heating and cooling timescales of $9.0^{+3.5}_{-2.1}$ hr, and $3.6^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ hr, respectively. We compare the light-curve to various 1-dimensional and 3-dimensional forward models, varying the planet's chemical composition. The strong contrast in flux increase and decrease timescales before and after periapse indicates an opacity term that emerges during the planet's heating phase, potentially due to more H$^{-}$ than expected from chemical equilibrium models. The phase-resolved spectra are largely featureless, that we interpret as indicative an inhomogeneous dayside. However, we identified an anomalously high flux in the spectroscopic bin coinciding with the hydrogen Paschen $\beta$ line and that is likely connected to the planet's orbit. We interpret this as due to shock heating of the upper atmosphere given the short timescale involved, or evidence for other star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of Proper Motions of the Dust Clumps in the Protoplanetary Disk MWC 758</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the dust dynamics in the dust trapping vortices in the protoplanetary disk around MWC~758, we analyzed the 1.3 mm continuum images of the MWC~758 disk obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in 2017 and 2021. We detect proper motions of 22 mas and 24 mas in the two dust clumps at radii of 0\farcs32 and 0\farcs54 in the disk on the plane of the sky, respectively. On the assumption that the dust clumps are located in the disk midplane, the velocities of the observed proper motions along the azimuthal direction of the inner and outer dust clumps are sub- and super-Keplerian, respectively, and both have angular velocities corresponding to the Keplerian angular velocity at a radius of $0\farcs46\pm0\farcs04$. This deviation from the Keplerian motion is not expected in the conventional theory of vortices formed by the Rossby wave instability. The observed non-Keplerian proper motions of the dust clumps are unlikely due to the disk warp and eccentricity, nor be associated with any predicted planets. The two dust clumps are likely spatially coincident with the infrared spirals. In addition, we detect the changes in the intensity profiles of the dust clumps over the four-year span. Therefore, we suggest that the observed proper motions are possibly due to changes in the density distributions in the dust clumps caused by their interaction with the spirals in the disk.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG: TBD. Studies of atmospheric FeII winds in ultra-hot Jupiters KELT-9b and KELT-20b using HARPS-N spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are gas giant planets orbiting close to their host star, with equilibrium temperatures exceeding 2000 K, and among the most studied planets in terms of their atmospheric composition. Thanks to a new generation of ultra-stable high-resolution spectrographs, it is possible to detect the signal from the individual lines of the species in the exoplanetary atmospheres. We employed two techniques in this study. First, we used transmission spectroscopy, which involved examining the spectra around single lines of FeII. Then we carried out a set of cross-correlation studies for two UHJs: KELT-9b and KELT-20b. Both planets orbit fast-rotating stars, which resulted in the detection of the strong Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and center-to-limb variations in the transmission spectrum. These effects had to be corrected to ensure a precise analysis. Using the transmission spectroscopy method, we detected 21 single lines of FeII in the atmosphere of KELT-9b. All of the detected lines are blue-shifted, suggesting strong day-to-night side atmospheric winds. The cross-correlation method leads to the detection of the blue-shifted signal with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 13.46. Our results are in agreement with models based on non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE) effects, with a mean micro-turbulence of nu_mic = 2.73 +/- 1.5 km/s and macro-turbulence of nu_mac = 8.22 +/- 3.85 km/s. In the atmosphere of KELT-20b, we detected 17 single lines of FeII. Considering different measurements of the systemic velocity of the system, we conclude that the existence of winds in the atmosphere of KELT-20b cannot be determined conclusively. The detected signal with the cross-correlation method presents a S/N of 11.51. The results are consistent with NLTE effects, including means of nu_mic = 3.04 +/- 0.35 km/s and nu_mac = 6.76 +/- 1.17 km/s.</description>

      <title>Forcing Planets to Evolve: The Relationship Between Uranus and Neptune at Late Stages of Dynamical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical properties of the bodies in the outer Solar System hold information regarding the planets' orbital histories. In early Solar System numerical simulations, where chaos is a primary driver, it is difficult to explore parameter space in a systematic way. In such simulations, stable configurations are hard to come by, and often require special fine-tuning. In addition, it is infeasible to run suites of well-resolved, realistic simulations with massive particles to drive planetary evolution where enough particles remain to represent the transneptunian populations to robustly statistically compare with observations. To complement state of the art full N-body simulations, we develop a method to artificially control each planet's orbital elements independently from each other, which when carefully applied, can be used to test a wider suite of models. We modify two widely used publicly available N-body integrators: (1) the C code, REBOUND and (2) the FORTRAN code, Mercury. We show how the application of specific fictitious forces within numerical integrators can be used to tightly control planetary evolution to more easily explore migration and orbital excitation and damping. This tool allows us to replicate the impact a massive planetesimal disk would have on the planets, without actually including the massive planetesimals, thus decreasing the chaos and simulation runtime. We highlight an appropriate application that shows the impact of Neptune's eccentricity damping and radial outward migration on Uranus' eccentricity</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Chemical Composition of WD 1145+017: Impact of Circumstellar Disks Contamination on Photospheric Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed a chemical analysis of the asteroid-bearing white dwarf WD 1145+017 using optical and ultraviolet spectroscopic data from 25 epochs between 2015 and 2023. We present an updated gas disk model with improved opacity calculations and temperature profiles to properly account for all circumstellar absorption features. Incorporating these changes into our models, we identified at least 10 elements in the disk, including a detection of circumstellar Na. We detected 16 elements in the photosphere, including new detections of P, Co and Cu. At 16 elements, WD 1145+017 ties GD 362 as one of the most polluted white dwarfs in terms of the number of elements detected. We find that both the disk and photosphere compositions align, to first order, with CI Chondrite. Our study underscores the importance of accounting for circumstellar absorption, as neglecting them leads to significant abundance errors. Additionally, the analysis of the disk's opacity highlighted a ultraviolet flux reduction due to a pseudo-continuum due to a optically thick component. This result may affect previous analyses of other polluted white dwarfs, suggesting a need for revisiting some studies.</description>

      <title>Advection-nonlinear-diffusion model of flare accelerated electron transport in Type III solar radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons accelerated by solar flares and observed as type III solar radio bursts are not only a crucial diagnostic tool for understanding electron transport in the inner heliosphere but also a possible early indication of potentially hazardous space weather events. The electron beams travelling in the solar corona and heliosphere along magnetic field lines generate Langmuir waves and quasilinearly relax towards a plateau in velocity space. The relaxation of the electron beam over the short distance in contrast to large beam-travel distances observed is often referred to as Sturrok's dilemma. Here, we develop a new electron transport model with quasilinear distance/time self-consistently changing in space and time. The model results in a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation for the electron beam density with nonlinear diffusion term that inversely proportional to the beam density. The solution predicts slow super-diffusive (ballistic) spatial expansion of a fast propagating electron beam. The model also provides the evolution of the spectral energy density of Langmuir waves, which determines brightness temperature of plasma radiation in solar bursts. The model solution is consistent with the results of numerical simulation using kinetic equations and can explain some characteristics of type III solar radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Predicting photospheric UV emission from stellar evolutionary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar ultraviolet (UV) emission serves as a crucial indicator for estimating magnetic activity and evaluating the habitability of exoplanets orbiting stars. In this paper, we present a straightforward method to derive stellar photospheric UV emission for F to M main-sequence stars. By using PARSEC models, we establish relations between near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) magnitudes from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), NUV magnitudes from the China Space Station Telescope, and stellar effective temperatures and Gaia BP$-$RP color for different metallicities. Together with the observed sample, we find that for NUV emission, the photospheric contribution to the observed flux is less than 20% for M stars, around 10% to 70% for G stars, and ranges from 30% to 85% for G and F stars. For FUV emission, the photospheric contribution is less than $10^{-6}$ for M stars, below $10^{-4}$ for K stars, around $10^{-4}$ to 10% for G stars, and between 6% and 50% for F stars. Our work enables the simple and effective determination of stellar excess UV emission and the exploration of magnetic activity.</description>

      <title>An analytical theory for the resolution attainable using eclipse mapping of exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic theory for the resolution attainable via eclipse mapping of exoplanets, based on the Fourier components of the brightness distribution on the planetary disk. We find that the impact parameter determines which features can and cannot be seen, via the angle of the stellar edge relative to the axis of the orbit during the eclipse. We estimate the signal-to-noise ratio as a function of mapping resolution, and use this to determine the attainable resolution for a given star-planet system. We test this theory against numerical simulations and find good agreement; in particular, our predictions for the resolution as a function of stellar edge angle are accurate to the simulated data to within 10% over a wide range of angles. Our prediction for the number of spatial modes that can be constrained given a light curve error is similarly accurate. Finally, we give a list of exoplanets with the best expected resolution for observations with the NIRISS SOSS, NIRSpec G395H, and MIRI LRS instruments on JWST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Streaming Instability (SI) in dust has long been thought to be a promising process in triggering planetesimal formation in the protoplanetary disks (PPDs). In this study, we present the first numerical investigation that models the SI in the vertically stratified disk together with the dust coagulation process. Our simulations reveal that, even with the initial small dust sizes, because dust coagulation promotes dust size growth, SI can eventually still be triggered. As such, the dust coagulation process broadens the parameter boundaries obtained from the previous SI studies using single dust species. We describe the various stages of dust dynamics along with their size evolution, and explore the impact of different dust fragmentation velocities. Implications of these results for realistic PPDs are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several hundreds of thousands of eclipsing binaries (EBs) are expected to be detected in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full frame images (FFIs). This represents a significant increase in the number of EBs available for eclipse timing variation studies. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of performing precise eclipse timing of TESS EBs using the FFIs. To this end, we developed a fast, automated method and applied it to a sample of $\sim$100 EBs selected from the Villanova TESS EB catalog. Our timing analysis resulted in the detection of ten new triple candidates with outer periods shorter than $\sim$1300$\,$d. For five of them, we were able to constrain the outer orbit by analyzing independently the short-cadence (SC) and FFI data and to derive the minimum mass of the third body with a precision better than 4 per cent for SC and 11 per cent for FFI data. We then compared the results obtained from the two datasets and found that using the FFI data leads to (1) a degradation of both the accuracy and precision of the tertiary mass determination for the tightest EBs and (2) an overall underestimation of the third component's mass. However, we stress that our main conclusions on the nature of the detected signals do not depend on which dataset is used. This confirms the great potential of TESS FFIs, which will allow us to search for rare objects such as substellar circumbinary companions and compact triple stellar systems.</description>
