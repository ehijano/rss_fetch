      <title>CROP: Integrating Topological and Spatial Structures via Cross-View Prefixes for Molecular LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in molecular science have been propelled significantly by large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is limited when relying solely on molecular sequences, which fail to capture the complex structures of molecules. Beyond sequence representation, molecules exhibit two complementary structural views: the first focuses on the topological relationships between atoms, as exemplified by the graph view; and the second emphasizes the spatial configuration of molecules, as represented by the image view. The two types of views provide unique insights into molecular structures. To leverage these views collaboratively, we propose the CROss-view Prefixes (CROP) to enhance LLMs' molecular understanding through efficient multi-view integration. CROP possesses two advantages: (i) efficiency: by jointly resampling multiple structural views into fixed-length prefixes, it avoids excessive consumption of the LLM's limited context length and allows easy expansion to more views; (ii) effectiveness: by utilizing the LLM's self-encoded molecular sequences to guide the resampling process, it boosts the quality of the generated prefixes. Specifically, our framework features a carefully designed SMILES Guided Resampler for view resampling, and a Structural Embedding Gate for converting the resulting embeddings into LLM's prefixes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CROP in tasks including molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction and molecule property prediction.</description>

      <title>Fractal Language Modelling by Universal Sequence Maps (USM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: With the advent of Language Models using Transformers, popularized by ChatGPT, there is a renewed interest in exploring encoding procedures that numerically represent symbolic sequences at multiple scales and embedding dimensions. The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for mechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of individual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as neural networks.
  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively encode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of two Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that can be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM coordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer frequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and, paradoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.
  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal Sequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process. The resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing outcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity; and 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging towards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results for genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation defined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless, the application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be straightforward.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees with non-identical leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees summarize evolutionary relationships. The Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) space for comparing phylogenetic trees has many elegant mathematical properties, but it does not encompass trees with differing leaf sets. To overcome this, we introduce Towering space: a complete metric space that extends BHV space to trees with non-identical leaf sets. Towering space is a structured collection of BHV spaces connected via pruning and regrafting operations. We study the geometry of paths in Towering space and present an algorithm for computing metric distances. By addressing a major limitation of BHV space, Towering space facilitates the analysis of modern phylogenetic datasets such as multi-domain gene trees.</description>

      <title>A Stage-Aware Mixture of Experts Framework for Neurodegenerative Disease Progression Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-term progression of neurodegenerative diseases is commonly conceptualized as a spatiotemporal diffusion process that consists of a graph diffusion process across the structural brain connectome and a localized reaction process within brain regions. However, modeling this progression remains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained through irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of pathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where traditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms dominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert weighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to properly estimate the temporal position of individual observations, constructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots. Model-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural diffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and time, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also introduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond standard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these components across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how stage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The stage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature, suggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages, while other unknown physical processes become dominant later on.</description>

      <title>K-Dense Analyst: Towards Fully Automated Scientific Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model (GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only 18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery across the life sciences.</description>

      <title>RNA-KG v2.0: An RNA-centered Knowledge Graph with Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA-KG is a recently developed knowledge graph that integrates the interactions involving coding and non-coding RNA molecules extracted from public data sources. It can be used to support the classification of new molecules, identify new interactions through the use of link prediction methods, and reveal hidden patterns among the represented entities. In this paper, we propose RNA-KG v2.0, a new release of RNA-KG that integrates around 100M manually curated interactions sourced from 91 linked open data repositories and ontologies. Relationships are characterized by standardized properties that capture the specific context (e.g., cell line, tissue, pathological state) in which they have been identified. In addition, the nodes are enriched with detailed attributes, such as descriptions, synonyms, and molecular sequences sourced from platforms such as OBO ontologies, NCBI repositories, RNAcentral, and Ensembl. The enhanced repository enables the expression of advanced queries that take into account the context in which the experiments were conducted. It also supports downstream applications in RNA research, including "context-aware" link prediction techniques that combine both topological and semantic information.</description>

      <title>Modelling phenology using ordered categorical generalized additive models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One form of data collected in ecology is phenological, describing the timing of life stages. It can be tempting to analyze such data using a continuous distribution or to model individual transitions via probit/logit models. Such simplifications can lead to incorrect inference in various ways, all of which stem from ignoring the natural structure of the data. This paper presents a flexible approach to modelling ordered categorical data using the popular R package `mgcv`. An example analysis of saxifrage phenology in Greenland including useful plots, model checking and derived quantities is included.</description>

      <title>Adding structure to generalized additive models, with applications in ecology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) that connect a set of scalar covariates that map 1-1 to a response variable are commonly employed in ecological and other scientific disciplines. However, covariates are often inherently non-scalar, taking on multiple values for each observation of the response. They can sometimes have a temporal structure, e.g., a time series of temperature and precipitation measurements, or a spatial structure, e.g., multiple soil pH measurements made at nearby locations. While aggregating or selectively summarizing such covariates to yield a scalar covariate allows the use of standard GAM fitting procedures, exactly how to do so can be problematic, e.g., using a mean or median value for some subsequence of a time series, and information is necessarily lost as well. On the other hand naively including all $p$ components of a vector-valued covariate as $p$ separate covariates, say, without recognizing the structure, can lead to problems of multicollinearity, data sets that are excessively wide given the sample size, and difficulty extracting the primary signal provided by the covariate. In this paper we introduce three useful extensions to GAMs that provide means of efficiently and effectively handling vector-valued covariates without requiring one to choose problematic aggregations or selective summarizations. These extensions are varying-coefficient, scalar-on-function and distributed lag models. While these models have existed for some time they remain relatively underused in ecology. This article aims to show when these models can be useful and how to fit them with the popular R package \texttt{mgcv}.</description>

      <title>Mamba-based Deep Learning Approach for Sleep Staging on a Wireless Multimodal Wearable System without Electroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Study Objectives: We investigate a Mamba-based deep learning approach for sleep staging on signals from ANNE One (Sibel Health, Evanston, IL), a non-intrusive dual-module wireless wearable system measuring chest electrocardiography (ECG), triaxial accelerometry, and chest temperature, and finger photoplethysmography and finger temperature.
  Methods: We obtained wearable sensor recordings from 357 adults undergoing concurrent polysomnography (PSG) at a tertiary care sleep lab. Each PSG recording was manually scored and these annotations served as ground truth labels for training and evaluation of our models. PSG and wearable sensor data were automatically aligned using their ECG channels with manual confirmation by visual inspection. We trained a Mamba-based recurrent neural network architecture on these recordings. Ensembling of model variants with similar architectures was performed.
  Results: After ensembling, the model attains a 3-class (wake, non rapid eye movement [NREM] sleep, rapid eye movement [REM] sleep) balanced accuracy of 84.02%, F1 score of 84.23%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 72.89%, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) score of 73.00%; a 4-class (wake, light NREM [N1/N2], deep NREM [N3], REM) balanced accuracy of 75.30%, F1 score of 74.10%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 61.51%, and MCC score of 61.95%; a 5-class (wake, N1, N2, N3, REM) balanced accuracy of 65.11%, F1 score of 66.15%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 53.23%, MCC score of 54.38%.
  Conclusions: Our Mamba-based deep learning model can successfully infer major sleep stages from the ANNE One, a wearable system without electroencephalography (EEG), and can be applied to data from adults attending a tertiary care sleep clinic.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Hepatitis B Virus Infection Dynamics through Physics-Informed Deep Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of viral disease outbreaks is crucial for guiding public health responses and preventing widespread loss of life. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising framework that can capture the intricate dynamics of viral infection and reliably predict its future progression. However, despite notable advances, the application of PINNs in disease modeling remains limited. Standard PINNs are effective in simulating disease dynamics through forward modeling but often face challenges in estimating key biological parameters from sparse or noisy experimental data when applied in an inverse framework. To overcome these limitations, a recent extension known as Disease Informed Neural Networks (DINNs) has emerged, offering a more robust approach to parameter estimation tasks. In this work, we apply this DINNs technique on a recently proposed hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection dynamics model to predict infection transmission within the liver. This model consists of four compartments: uninfected and infected hepatocytes, rcDNA-containing capsids, and free viruses. Leveraging the power of DINNs, we study the impacts of (i) variations in parameter range, (ii) experimental noise in data, (iii) sample sizes, (iv) network architecture and (v) learning rate. We employ this methodology in experimental data collected from nine HBV-infected chimpanzees and observe that it reliably estimates the model parameters. DINNs can capture infection dynamics and predict their future progression even when data of some compartments of the system are missing. Additionally, it identifies the influential model parameters that determine whether the HBV infection is cleared or persists within the host.</description>

      <title>Targeting Neurodegeneration: Three Machine Learning Methods for G9a Inhibitors Discovery Using PubChem and Scikit-learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In light of the increasing interest in G9a's role in neuroscience, three machine learning (ML) models, that are time efficient and cost effective, were developed to support researchers in this area. The models are based on data provided by PubChem and performed by algorithms interpreted by the scikit-learn Python-based ML library. The first ML model aimed to predict the efficacy magnitude of active G9a inhibitors. The ML models were trained with 3,112 and tested with 778 samples. The Gradient Boosting Regressor perform the best, achieving 17.81% means relative error (MRE), 21.48% mean absolute error (MAE), 27.39% root mean squared error (RMSE) and 0.02 coefficient of determination (R2) error. The goal of the second ML model called a CID_SID ML model, utilised PubChem identifiers to predict the G9a inhibition probability of a small biomolecule that has been primarily designed for different purposes. The ML models were trained with 58,552 samples and tested with 14,000. The most suitable classifier for this case study was the Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier, which obtained 78.1% accuracy, 84.3% precision,69.1% recall, 75.9% F1-score and 8.1% Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC). The third ML model based on the Random Forest Classifier algorithm led to the generation of a list of descending-ordered functional groups based on their importance to the G9a inhibition. The model was trained with 19,455 samples and tested with 14,100. The probability of this rank was 70% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hemodynamic Markers: CFD-Based Prediction of Cerebral Aneurysm Rupture Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of aneurysm evolution on hemodynamic characteristics within the sac region. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), blood flow through the parent vessel and aneurysm sac was analyzed to assess the impact on wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), and the oscillatory shear index (OSI), key indicators of rupture risk. Additionally, Relative Residence Time (RRT) and Endothelial Cell Activation Potential (ECAP) were examined to provide a broader understanding of the aneurysm's hemodynamic environment. Six distinct cerebral aneurysm (CA) models, all from individuals of the same gender, were selected to minimize gender-related variability.
  Results showed that unruptured cases exhibited higher WSS and TAWSS, along with lower OSI and RRT values patterns consistent with stable flow conditions supporting vascular integrity. In contrast, ruptured cases had lower WSS and TAWSS, coupled with elevated OSI and RRT, suggesting disturbed and oscillatory flow commonly linked to aneurysm wall weakening. ECAP was also higher in ruptured cases, indicating increased endothelial activation under unstable flow. Notably, areas with the highest OSI and RRT often aligned with vortex centers, reinforcing the association between disturbed flow and aneurysm instability.
  These findings highlight the value of combining multiple hemodynamic parameters for rupture risk assessment. Including RRT and ECAP provides deeper insight into flow endothelium-interactions, offering a stronger basis for evaluating aneurysm stability and guiding treatment decisions.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic inference of stochastic gene expression from structured single-cell data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell gene expression measurements encode variability spanning molecular noise, cell-to-cell heterogeneity, and technical artifacts. Mechanistic stochastic models provide powerful approaches to disentangle these sources, yet inferring underlying dynamics from standard snapshot sequencing data faces fundamental identifiability limitations. This review focuses on how structured datasets with temporal, spatial, or multimodal features offer constraints to resolve these ambiguities, but demand more sophisticated models and inference strategies, including machine-learning techniques with inherent tradeoffs. We highlight recent progress in the judicious integration of structured single-cell data, stochastic model development, and innovative inference strategies to extract predictive, gene-level insights. These advances lay the foundation for scaling mechanistic inference upward to regulatory networks and multicellular tissues.</description>

      <title>Accurate Measles Rash Detection via Vision Transformer Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09112</link>

Abstract: Measles, a highly contagious disease declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of successful vaccination campaigns, resurged in 2025, with 1,356 confirmed cases reported as of August 5, 2025. Given its rapid spread among susceptible individuals, fast and reliable diagnostic systems are critical for early prevention and containment. In this work, we applied transfer learning to fine-tune a pretrained Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model for distinguishing measles rashes from other skin conditions. Trained on a diverse, curated skin rash image dataset, the DeiT model achieved a median classification accuracy of 96.38%, precision of 96.24%, recall of 96.38%, and an F1-score of 96.23%, demonstrating high effectiveness in accurate detection to aid outbreak control. We also compared the DeiT model with a convolutional neural network, ResNet-50, and discussed the directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Expectation-maximization for structure determination directly from cryo-EM micrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) measurement, called a micrograph, consists of multiple two-dimensional tomographic projections of a three-dimensional (3-D) molecular structure at unknown locations, taken under unknown viewing directions. All existing cryo-EM algorithmic pipelines first locate and extract the projection images, and then reconstruct the structure from the extracted images. However, if the molecular structure is small, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data is very low, making it challenging to accurately detect projection images within the micrograph. Consequently, all standard techniques fail in low-SNR regimes. To recover molecular structures from measurements of low SNR, and in particular small molecular structures, we devise an approximate expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the 3-D structure directly from the micrograph, bypassing the need to locate the projection images. We corroborate our computational scheme with numerical experiments and present successful structure recoveries from simulated noisy measurements.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control on the Neural Manifold</title>

Abstract: Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control the latent activity of a circuit would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. We simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. The fields of classical and optimal control offer a range of methods to choose from for controlling dynamics on the neural manifold, which differ in performance, computational cost, and ease of implementation. Here, we focus on two commonly used control methods: proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and model predictive control (MPC). PID is a computationally lightweight controller that is simple to implement. In contrast, MPC is a model-based, anticipatory controller with a much higher computational cost and engineering overhead. We evaluate both methods on trajectory-following tasks in latent space, under partial observability and in the presence of unknown noise. While both controllers in some cases were able to successfully control the latent dynamics on the neural manifold, MPC consistently produced more accurate control and required less hyperparameter tuning. These results demonstrate how MPC can be applied on the neural manifold using data-driven dynamics models, and provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and external stimuli.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of human population reproduction through marriage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear one-sex dynamical model of human population reproduction through marriage. In our model, a woman may marry and divorce multiple times; however, only women who are currently married are assumed to bear children. The iterative marriage process is formulated as a three-state compartmental model, which is described by a system of McKendrick equations with a marital birth rate function that depends on the duration of marriage and the age at marriage. To examine the impact of changing nuptiality on fertility, we derive new formulas for the reproduction indices. In particular, the total fertility rate (TFR) is expressed as the product of the total marriage number and the average total marital fertility. Using Japanese vital statistics, we show that our model provides a reasonable estimate of the current TFR and its future trajectory.</description>

      <title>Continual Multiple Instance Learning for Hematologic Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.</description>
