      <title>Complex median method and Schatten class membership of commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of the Schatten class membership of commutators involving singular integral operators. We utilize martingale paraproducts and Hyt\"{o}nen's dyadic martingale technique to obtain sufficient conditions on the weak-type and strong-type Schatten class membership of commutators in terms of Sobolev spaces and Besov spaces respectively.
  We also establish the complex median method, which is applicable to complex-valued functions. We apply it to get the optimal necessary conditions on the weak-type and strong-type Schatten class membership of commutators associated with non-degenerate kernels. This resolves the problem on the characterization of the weak-type and strong-type Schatten class membership of commutators.
  Our new approach is built on Hyt\"{o}nen's dyadic martingale technique and the complex median method. Compared with all the previous ones, this new one is more powerful in several aspects: $(a)$ it permits us to deal with more general singular integral operators with little smoothness; $(b)$ it allows us to deal with commutators with complex-valued kernels; $(c)$ it turns out to be powerful enough to deal with the weak-type and strong-type Schatten class of commutators in a universal way.</description>

      <title>Spectral equivalences through nonstandard samplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to introduce a process that generates, given Hilbert space $H$ and symmetric operator $A$, an embedding of $H$ into an $L_2$-space through which $A$ is extended by a multiplication operator. This process will depend on two parameters, the nonstandard sampling and the standard-biased scale.
  We will use that process to prove diverse versions of the general spectral theorem, showing its appeal. Furthermore, through landmark examples, we will observe that by carefully tweaking the two parameters, we can make the resulting spaces, embeddings and operators quite explicit and natural.</description>

      <title>A Derivative-Hilbert operator acting on BMOA space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure on the interval $[0,1)$. The Hankel matrix $\mathcal{H}_{\mu}=(\mu_{n,k})_{n,k\geq 0}$ with entries $\mu_{n,k}=\mu_{n+k}$, where $\mu_{n}=\int_{[0,1)}t^nd\mu(t)$, induces, formally, the Derivative-Hilbert operator $$\mathcal{DH}_\mu(f)(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty \mu_{n,k}a_k\right)(n+1)z^n , ~z\in \mathbb{D},$$ where $f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n$ is an analytic function in $\mathbb{D}$. We characterize the measures $\mu$ for which $\mathcal{DH}_\mu$ is a bounded operator on $BMOA$ space. We also study the analogous problem from the $\alpha$-Bloch space $\mathcal{B}_\alpha(\alpha&gt;0)$ into the $BMOA$ space.</description>

      <title>Unitary rational functions: The scaled quaternion case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of minimal realizations and factorizations of rational functions where the coefficient space is a ring of the type introduced in our previous work, the scaled quaternions, which includes as special cases the quaternions and the split quaternions. The methods involved are not a direct generalization of the complex or quaternionic settings, and in particular, the adjoint is not the classical adjoint and we use properties of real Hilbert spaces. This adjoint allows to define the counterpart of unitarity for matrix-rational functions, and we develop the corresponding theories of realizations and unitary factorizations. We also begin a theory of matrices in the underlying rings.</description>

      <title>Weak Factorizations of the Hardy Spaces in Terms of Multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund Operators on Ball Banach Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our main purpose is to establish a weak factorization of the classical Hardy spaces in terms of a multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operator on the ball Banach function spaces. Furthermore, a new characterization of the BMO space via the boundedness of the commutator generated by the multilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operator is also obtained. The results obtained in this paper have generality. As examples, we apply the above results to weighted Lebesgue space, variable Lebesgue space, Herz space, mixed-norm Lebesgue space, Lorentz space and so on.</description>

      <title>An injective-type norm and integral bilinear forms defined by sequence classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we define a class of injective-type norm on tensor products through the environment of sequence classes. Examples and results on this norm will be presented and the duality is studied in this context. As a byproduct, we present the definition of the associated integral-type bilinear forms and also a tensor characterization for a class of sequence spaces.</description>

      <title>Topology and regularity for generalized ultradistribution algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compiling essential results for non-quasianalytic ultradistribution spaces and Colombeau versions of generalized ultradistribution algebras, we analyze strong $B$- and strong $R$-association of a generalized ultradistribution $[(f_\varepsilon)]$. The strong association of $[(f_\varepsilon)]$ to a Komatsu-type ultradistribution $T$, with additional assumption on regularity of $[(f_\varepsilon)]$ of Beurling, respectively, Roumieu type, implies that $T$ is an ultradifferentiable function of Beurling, Roumieu type, respectively. We demonstrate that, under suitable conditions on regularity, a weakly negligible net $(g_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon\in(0,1)}$ (meaning that the net of complex numbers $(\int g_\varepsilon\phi dx)_{\varepsilon\in(0,1)}$ is Beurling, respectively, Roumieu negligible for every ultradifferentiable function $\phi$ in the corresponding test space), is a negligible net in the sense of generalized ultradistributions. Furthermore, we prove that a translation invariant generalized ultradistribution $g$ is equal to a generalized constant in both types of generalized ultradistribution algebras.</description>

      <title>Continuity of Metric Projection Operator from C[0, 1] onto Pn with Applications to Mordukhovich Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let C[0, 1] be the Banach space of all continuous real valued functions on [0, 1]. For an arbitrarily given nonnegative integer n, let Pn denote the set of all polynomials with degree less than or equal to n. Pn is a closed subspace of C[0, 1]. In this paper, we first prove (in details) that the metric projection operator from C[0, 1] to Pn is a single-valued mapping and it is (norm to norm) continuous. Then, we use the continuity of Pn to investigate the Gateaux directional derivatives, some properties and fixed-point properties of the Mordukhovich derivatives of the metric projection operator.</description>

      <title>Dichotomies uniform on subspaces and formulas for dichotomy spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we introduce a notion of dichotomy which generalizes the classical concept of exponential dichotomy and the recent notion of Bohl dichotomy. A key attribute is the discussion of the sets of subspaces of the state space on which the dichotomy estimates are uniform. Two main results are a dichotomy spectral theorem based on our notion of dichotomy which is uniform on subspaces and a formula for the dichotomy spectral intervals which is new for the Bohl dichotomy spectrum as well as for the classical exponential dichotomy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Fine properties of nonlinear potentials and a unified perspective on monotonicity formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a large family of monotone quantities along the weak inverse mean curvature flow is the limit case of the corresponding ones along the level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials. Such monotone quantities include Willmore and Minkowski-type functionals on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In $3$-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, we also recover the monotonicity of the Hawking mass and its nonlinear potential theoretic counterparts. This unified view is built on a refined analysis of $p$-capacitary potentials. We prove that they strongly converge in $W^{1,q}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ as $p\to 1^+$ to the inverse mean curvature flow and their level sets are curvature varifolds. Finally, we also deduce a Gauss-Bonnet-type theorem for level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wasserstein Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization, where negative weights are allowed, of the Wasserstein barycenter of $n$ probability measures. The barycenter is found, as usual, as a minimum of a functional. In this paper, we prove existence of a minimizer for probability measures on a separable Hilbert space and uniqueness in the case of one positive coefficient and $n-1$ negative ones. In the one-dimensional case, we characterize the quantile function of the unique minimum as the orthogonal projection of the $L^2$-barycenter of the quantiles on the cone of nonincreasing functions in $L^2(0,1)$. Further, we provide a stability estimate in dimension one and a counterexample to uniqueness in $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Flows on uniform Roe algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a uniformly locally finite metric space $(X, d)$, we investigate \emph{coarse} flows on its uniform Roe algebra $\mathrm{C}^*_u(X)$, defined as one-parameter groups of automorphisms whose differentiable elements include all partial isometries arising from partial translations on $X$. We first show that any flow $\sigma$ on $\mathrm{C}^*_u(X)$ corresponds to a (possibly unbounded) self-adjoint operator $h$ on $\ell_2(X)$ such that $\sigma_t(a) = e^{ith} a e^{-ith}$ for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, allowing us to focus on operators $h$ that generate flows on $ \mathrm{C}^*_u (X)$.
  Assuming Yu's property A, we prove that a self-adjoint operator $h$ on $\ell_2(X)$ induces a coarse flow on $\mathrm{C}^*_u(X)$ if and only if $h$ can be expressed as $h = a + d$, where $a \in \mathrm{C}^*_u(X)$ and $d$ is a diagonal operator with entries forming a coarse function on $X$. We further study cocycle equivalence and cocycle perturbations of coarse flows, showing that, under property A, any coarse flow is a cocycle perturbation of a diagonal flow. Finally, for self-adjoint operators $h$ and $k$ that induce coarse flows on $\mathrm{C}^*_u(X)$, we characterize conditions under which the associated flows are either cocycle perturbations of each other or cocycle conjugate. In particular, if $h - k$ is bounded, then the flow induced by $h$ is a cocycle perturbation of the flow induced by $k$.</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of the Wasserstein space over the plane with the maximum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $p$-Wasserstein spaces over the branching spaces $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $[0,1]^2$ equipped with the maximum norm metric. We show that these spaces are isometrically rigid for all $p\geq1,$ meaning that all isometries of these spaces are induced by isometries of the underlying space via the push-forward operation. This is in contrast to the case of the Euclidean metric since with that distance the $2$-Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not rigid. Also, we highlight that $1$-Wasserstein space is not rigid over the interval $[0,1]$, while according to our result, its two-dimensional analog with the more complicated geodesic structure is rigid. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first ones concerning the structure of isometries of Wasserstein spaces over branching spaces. Accordingly, our proof techniques substantially deviate from those used for non-branching underlying spaces.</description>

      <title>Power boundedness and related properties for weighted composition operators on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize those pairs $(\psi,\varphi)$ of smooth mappings $\psi:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{C},\varphi:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^d$ for which the corresponding weighted composition operator $C_{\psi,\varphi}f=\psi\cdot(f\circ\varphi)$ acts continuously on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Additionally, we give several easy-to-check necessary and sufficient conditions of this property for interesting special cases. Moreover, we characterize power boundedness and topologizablity of $C_{\psi,\varphi}$ on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in terms of $\psi,\varphi$. Among other things, as an application of our results we show that for a univariate polynomial $\varphi$ with $\text{deg}(\varphi)\geq 2$, power boundedness of $C_{\psi,\varphi}$ on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R})$ for every $\psi\in\mathscr{O}_M(\mathbb{R})$ only depends on $\varphi$ and that in this case power boundedness of $C_{\psi,\varphi}$ is equivalent to $(C_{\psi,\varphi}^n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converging to $0$ in $\mathcal{L}_b(\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R}))$ as well as to the uniform mean ergodicity of $C_{\psi,\varphi}$. Additionally, we give an example of a power bounded and uniformly mean ergodic weighted composition operator $C_{\psi,\varphi}$ on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R})$ for which neither the multiplication operator $f\mapsto \psi f$ nor the composition operator $f\mapsto f\circ\varphi$ acts on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R})$. Our results complement and considerably extend various results of Fern\'andez, Galbis, and the second named author.</description>

      <title>Square functions associated with Ritt$_E$ operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a subset $E = \{\xi_1, ..., \xi_N\}$ of the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$, the notion of Ritt$_E$ operators on a Banach space and their functional calculus on generalized Stolz domains was developed and studied in arXiv:2203.05373.
  In this paper, we define a quadratic functional calculus for a Ritt$_E$ operator on $E_r$, by a decomposition of type Franks-McIntosh. We show that with some hypothesis on the cotype of $X$, this notion is equivalent to the existence of a bounded functional calculus on $E_r$.
  We define for a Ritt$_E$ operator on a Banach space $X$ and for any positive real number $\alpha$ and for any $x \in X$
  $$
  \Vert{x}\Vert_{T,\alpha} = \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow \infty}\Bigl\Vert{\sum\limits_{k=1}^n k^{\alpha - 1/2} \varepsilon_k \otimes T^{k-1}\prod\limits_{j=1}^N(I-\overline{\xi_j}T)^\alpha(x)}\Bigr\Vert_{{\rm Rad}(X)}
  $$
  We show that, under the condition of finite cotype of $X$, a Ritt$_E$ operator admits a quadratic functional calculus if and only if the estimates $\Vert{x}\Vert_{T,\alpha} \lesssim \Vert{x}\Vert$ hold for both $T$ and $T^*$.
  We finally prove the equivalence between these square functions.</description>

      <title>Matrix hypercontractivity, streaming algorithms and LDCs: the large alphabet case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.02600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued functions defined over large alphabets. In order to do so, we prove a generalization of the powerful $2$-uniform convexity inequality for trace norms of Ball, Carlen, Lieb (Inventiones Mathematicae'94). Using our hypercontractive~inequality, we present upper and lower bounds for the communication complexity of the Hidden Hypermatching problem defined over large alphabets. We then consider streaming algorithms for approximating the value of Unique Games on a hypergraph with $t$-size hyperedges. By using our communication lower bound, we show that every streaming algorithm in the adversarial model achieving an $(r-\varepsilon)$-approximation of this value requires $\Omega(n^{1-2/t})$ quantum space, where $r$ is the alphabet size. We next present a lower bound for locally decodable codes (LDC) $\mathbb{Z}_r^n\to \mathbb{Z}_r^N$ over large alphabets with recoverability probability at least $1/r + \varepsilon$. Using hypercontractivity, we give an exponential lower bound $N = 2^{\Omega(\varepsilon^4 n/r^4)}$ for $2$-query (possibly non-linear) LDCs over $\mathbb{Z}_r$ and using the non-commutative Khintchine inequality we prove an improved lower bound of $N = 2^{\Omega(\varepsilon^2 n/r^2)}$.</description>

      <title>Uniform Approximation with Quadratic Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the approximation capabilities of deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Quadratic Unit (ReQU) activation function, defined as \(\max(0,x)^2\), for approximating H\"older-regular functions with respect to the uniform norm. We constructively prove that deep neural networks with ReQU activation can approximate any function within the \(R\)-ball of \(r\)-H\"older-regular functions (\(\mathcal{H}^{r, R}([-1,1]^d)\)) up to any accuracy \(\epsilon \) with at most \(\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{-d /2r}\right)\) neurons and fixed number of layers. This result highlights that the effectiveness of the approximation depends significantly on the smoothness of the target function and the characteristics of the ReQU activation function. Our proof is based on approximating local Taylor expansions with deep ReQU neural networks, demonstrating their ability to capture the behavior of H\"older-regular functions effectively. Furthermore, the results can be straightforwardly generalized to any Rectified Power Unit (RePU) activation function of the form \(\max(0,x)^p\) for \(p \geq 2\), indicating the broader applicability of our findings within this family of activations.</description>

      <title>The cut norm and Sampling Lemmas for unbounded kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the bounded kernel results of Borgs, Chayes, Lov\'asz, S\'os and Vesztergombi (2008), we prove two Sampling Lemmas for unbounded kernels with respect to the cut norm. On the one hand, we show that given a (symmetric) kernel $U\in L^p([0,1]^2)$ for some $3&lt;p&lt;\infty$, the cut norm of a random $k$-sample of $U$ is with high probability within $O(k^{-\frac14+\frac{1}{4p}})$ of the cut norm of $U$. The cut norm of the sample has a strong bias to being larger than the original, allowing us to actually obtain a stronger high probability bound of order $O(k^{-\frac 12+\frac1p+\varepsilon})$ for how much smaller it can be (for any $p&gt;2$ here). These results are then partially extended to the case of vector valued kernels. On the other hand, we show that with high probability, the $k$-samples are also close to $U$ in the cut metric, albeit with a weaker bound of order $O((\ln k)^{-\frac12+\frac1{2p}})$ (for any appropriate $p&gt;2$). As a corollary, we obtain that whenever $U\in L^p$ with $p&gt;4$, the $k$-samples converge almost surely to $U$ in the cut metric as $k\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Bounded multiplier algebras arising from Fock representation associated to semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we attempt to introduce the "Multiplier algebra" associated to the Fock representation that arising from the left-cancellative semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ (denoted by $M(\mathcal{S})$) by adopting the concept of multiplier algebra of a $C^*$-algebra. Then, we investigate the basic properties and examples of the multiplier algebras. In order to make sense of multiplier algebra, we establish two key results of the multiplier algebras. We demonstrate that $M(\mathcal{S})$ is an unital Banach algebra if $\mathcal{S}$ is a left-cancellative semigroup. In the consideration, $G$ is a group, we demonstrate that $M(G)$ is a $C^*$-algebra.
  We illustrate that the associated multiplier algebras $M(\mathbb{Z}_{+}), M(\mathbb{Z}^2_+)$ are identified with respective Hardy algebras $H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D})$ and $H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D}^2)$ for $\mathcal{S}=\mathbb{Z}_{+}, \mathbb{Z}^2_{+}.$ Next, we discuss that multiplier algebra associated to the free semigroup $\mathcal{S}=\mathbb{F}^+_{n}$. We clearly show that the well-known non-commutative Hardy algebra $\mathbb{F}_{n}^{\infty}$ (introduced and thoroughly studied by G. Popescu) and the multiplier algebra $M(\mathbb{F}_{n}^+)$ are isometrically isomorphic.
  Finally, using the operator space technique, we have demonstrated an intriguing result that $M(\mathcal{S})$ is an operator algebra (specifically, thanks to celebrated Blecher-Ruan-Sinclair theorem).</description>

      <title>Small values and forbidden values for the Fourier antidiagonal constant of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13998v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, let ${\rm AD}(G)$ denote the Fourier norm of the antidiagonal in $G\times G$. It was shown recently by the author (IMRN, 2023) that ${\rm AD}(G)$ coincides with the amenability constant of the Fourier algebra of $G$, and is equal to the normalized sum of the cubes of character degrees of $G$. Motivated by a gap result for amenability constants due to Johnson (JLMS, 1994), we determine exactly which numbers in the interval $[1,2]$ arise as values of ${\rm AD}(G)$.
  As a by-product, we show that the set of values of ${\rm AD}(G)$ does not contain all its limit points. Some other calculations or bounds for ${\rm AD}(G)$ are given for familiar classes of finite groups. We also indicate a connection between ${\rm AD}(G)$ and the commuting probability of $G$, and use this to show that every finite group $G$ satisfying ${\rm AD}(G)&lt; \frac{61}{15}$ must be solvable; here the value $\frac{61}{15}$ is best possible.</description>

      <title>Exact quadratic growth for the derivatives of iterates of interval diffeomorphisms with only parabolic fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $C^2$ diffeomorphisms of a closed interval with only parabolic fixed points. We show that the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates of such a diffeomorphism is exactly quadratic provided it has a non-quadratical tangency to the identity at a fixed point that is topologically repelling on one side. Moreover, in absence of such fixed points, the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates is subquadratic.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>
