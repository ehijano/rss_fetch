      <title>Multiphoton ionization distributions beyond the dipole approximation: Retardation versus recoil corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nondipole effects in multiphoton ionization of a two-dimensional hydrogen-like atom by a flat-top laser pulse of varied intensity. For this purpose, we solve numerically a two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation treating a propagating laser pulse exactly. The resulting distributions are then compared to those calculated in the dipole approximation. A directional dependence of the energy-angular photoelectron distributions is demonstrated numerically in the case of a propagating laser pulse of a moderate and a high intensity. It is analytically interpreted based on the leading order relativistic expansion of the electron Volkov state, showing a significant contribution of the electron recoil to that behavior. In contrast, the retardation correction originating from the space- and time-dependence of the laser field leads to a tiny redshift of the photoelectron energy spectra. Other features of ionization distributions are also analyzed, including the sidelobes and the double-hump structures of multiphoton peaks, or their disappearance for intense propagating laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Using the Th III Ion for a Nuclear Clock and Searches for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 229Th nucleus possesses a unique low-frequency transition at 8.4 eV, which is being considered for the development of an extremely accurate nuclear clock. We investigate an electronic bridge process in the Th III ion, where nuclear excitation occurs via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper choice of laser frequencies can lead to a significant enhancement of this effect. Electrons also reduce the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.
  Additionally, the electronic structure of the Th III ion exhibits features that make it particularly useful for probing new physics. Notably, it contains a metastable state connected to the ground state via a weak M2 transition, which can be utilized for quantum information processing, as well as searches for oscillating axion field, violation of local Lorentz invariance, test of the Einstein's equivalence principle, and measurement of nuclear weak quadrupole moment. The electronic states of the ion present a unique case of level crossing involving the 5f, 6d, and 7s single-electron states. This crossing renders the transition frequencies highly sensitive to potential time-variation of the fine-structure constant.</description>
