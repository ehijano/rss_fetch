      <title>The reflection-transmission problem for inertial waves on geostrophic shear layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertial waves in fluid regions of planets and stars play an important role in their dynamics and evolution, through energy, heat and angular momentum transport and mixing of chemicals. While inertial wave propagation in flows prescribed by solid-body rotation is well-understood, natural environments are often characterized by convection or zonal flows. In these more realistic configurations, we do not yet understand the propagation of inertial waves or their transport properties. In this work, we focus on the interaction between inertial waves and geostrophic currents, which has thus far only been investigated using ray theory, where the wave length is assumed to be small relative to the length scale of the current, or averaging/statistical approaches. We develop a quasi-two-dimensional analytical model to investigate the reflection and transmission of inertial waves in the presence of a localized geostrophic shear layer of arbitrary width and compare our theoretical findings to a set of numerical simulations. We demonstrate that, in contrast to ray theory predictions, partial reflections occur even in subcritical shear layers and tunnelling with almost total transmission is possible in supercritical shear layers, if the layer is thin compared to the wavelength. That is, supercritical shear layers act as low-pass filters for inertial wave beams allowing the low-wavenumber waves to travel through. Thus, our analytical model allows us to predict interactions between inertial waves and geostrophic shear layers not addressed by ray-based or statistical theories and conceptually understand the behaviour of the full wavefield around and inside such layers.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed waveform inversion using pretrained wavefield neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is crucial for reconstructing high-resolution subsurface models, but it is often hindered, considering the limited data, by its null space resulting in low-resolution models, and more importantly, by its computational cost, especially if needed for real-time applications. Recent attempts to accelerate FWI using learned wavefield neural operators have shown promise in efficiency and differentiability, but typically suffer from noisy and unstable inversion performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel physics-informed FWI framework to enhance the inversion in accuracy while maintaining the efficiency of neural operator-based FWI. Instead of relying only on the L2 norm objective function via automatic differentiation, resulting in noisy model reconstruction, we integrate a physics constraint term in the loss function of FWI, improving the quality of the inverted velocity models. Specifically, starting with an initial model to simulate wavefields and then evaluating the loss over how much the resulting wavefield obeys the physical laws (wave equation) and matches the recorded data, we achieve a reduction in noise and artifacts. Numerical experiments using the OpenFWI and Overthrust models demonstrate our method's superior performance, offering cleaner and more accurate subsurface velocity than vanilla approaches. Considering the efficiency of the approach compared to FWI, this advancement represents a significant step forward in the practical application of FWI for real-time subsurface monitoring.</description>

      <title>MoWE : A Mixture of Weather Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a 2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast models.</description>
