      <title>Perspectives on the arithmetic nature of the ratios $\zeta(2n + 1)/\pi^{2n+1}$ and $\beta(2n)/\pi^{2n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the values of the Riemann zeta function at odd integers and the Dirichlet beta function at even integers, by collecting several distinct analytic frameworks converging to these values, thus providing a unifying perspective. Beyond analytic interest, these formulas motivate linear independence conjectures which, if established, would imply the irrationality of the quantities $\zeta(2n + 1)/\pi^{2n+1}$ and $\beta(2n)/\pi^{2n}$</description>

      <title>A Lie algebra associated with adjoint multiple zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jarossay introduced adjoint multiple zeta values, and he found $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic relations among adjoint multiple zeta values, referred to as the \emph{adjoint double shuffle relations}, by using Racinet's dual formulation of the generating series of multiple zeta values. Jarossay defined the affine scheme $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ determined by the adjoint double shuffle relations and posed a question whether $\mathrm{AdDMR}_0$ is isomorphic to Racinet's double shuffle group $\mathrm{DMR}_0$. In this paper, we refine Jarossay's question by formulating what we call the adjoint conditions and by addressing its Lie algebraic side. Within this framework, we construct the Lie algebra associated with the adjoint double shuffle relations by imposing Hirose's parity results.</description>

      <title>A higher rank shifted convolution problem with applications to L-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While several instances of shifted convolution problems for GL(3) x GL(2) have been solved, the case where one factor is the classical divisor function and one factor is a GL(3) Fourier coefficient has remained open. We solve this case in the present paper. The proof involves two intertwined applications of different types of delta symbol methods. As an application we establish an asymptotic formula for central values of L-functions for a GL(3) automorphic form twisted by Dirichlet characters to moduli q &lt; Q.</description>

      <title>Calculating generators of power integral bases in sextic fields with a quadratic subfield: the general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some previous works we gave algorithms for determining generators of power integral basis in sextic fields with a quadratic subfield, under certain restrictions. The purpose of the present paper is to extend those methods to the general case, when the relative integral basis of the sextic field over the quadratic subfield is of general form. This raises several technical difficulties, that we consider here.</description>

      <title>Tropicalization and cluster asymptotic phenomenon of generalized Markov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Helson's conjecture for smooth numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb E \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( \Psi(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly for $(\log x)^{30} \leq y \leq x$. Our bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</description>

      <title>Coincidence among sum formulas for zeta-like multiple values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two families of zeta-like multiple series -- the multiple $\rho$-values and the multiple $\eta$-values -- defined by nested sums with shifted denominators. An explicit factorial formula for $\rho$ reveals its intrinsic combinatorial structure and leads to closed expressions for fixed weight and depth. A remarkable identity emerges from a weighted-sum transformation, exhibiting a perfect discrete balance. The main theorem proves that the total sums of $\rho$- and $\eta$-values coincide for equal weight but complementary depths. This correspondence provides an analytic basis for integral representations of $\eta$-values and for deriving weighted sum relations. Together, these results show that the $\rho$- and $\eta$-families form two complementary realizations of a unified analytic-combinatorial structure, bridging factorial and harmonic formulations in zeta-like multiple sums.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic invariants of torus links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical analogy between knots and primes motivates the study of Alexander polynomials through an arithmetic perspective. In this article we study the two-parameter family of torus knots and links $T_{p,q}$ and analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the zeros of their Alexander polynomials $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$, defined with respect to the total linking number covering. We prove that as $p,q\to\infty$ these zeros become equidistributed on the unit circle and derive an explicit formula for the limiting frequency with which primitive $r$-th roots of unity appear. To capture finer statistical information, we introduce the moment sequence of the zero distribution and compute its generating function in closed form. We further examine the Iwasawa theory of the corresponding branched covers, determining the Iwasawa invariants. The logarithmic Mahler measure of $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$ vanishes identically and the associated homological growth in towers of abelian covers of $S^3$ branched along $T_{p,q}$ is subexponential.</description>

      <title>Rational Hodge--Tate prismatic crystals of quasi-l.c.i algebras and non-abelian $p$-adic Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a bounded prism $(A,I)$ and a bounded quasi-l.c.i algebra $R$ over $\overline{A}$. In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$ such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$ and topologically nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring $\overline{\Delta}_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in \overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$. Finally, we focus on some special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.</description>

      <title>Carl St{\o}rmer and his Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many proofs of Fermat's Two Squares Theorem, the smallest least residue solution $x_0$ of the quadratic congruence $x^2 \equiv -1 \bmod p$ plays an essential role; here $p$ is prime and $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. Such an $x_0$ is called a St{\o}rmer number, named after the Norwegian mathematician and astronomer Carl St{\o}rmer (1874-1957). In this paper, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $x_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ to be a St{\o}rmer number of some prime $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. St{\o}rmer's main interest in his investigations of St{\o}rmer numbers stemmed from his study of identities expressing $\pi$ as finite linear combinations of certain values of the Gregory-MacLaurin series for $\arctan(1/x)$. Since less than 600 digits of $\pi$ were known by 1900, approximating $\pi$ was an important topic. One such identity, discovered by St{\o}rmer in 1896, was used by Yasumasa Kanada and his team in 2002 to obtain 1.24 trillion digits of $\pi$. We also discuss St{\o}rmer's work on connecting these numbers to Gregory numbers and approximations of $\pi$. \u</description>

      <title>The Kudla-Millson lift of Siegel cusp forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the injectivity of the Kudla-Millson lift of genus 2 Siegel cusp forms, vector-valued with respect to the Weil representation associated to an even lattice L. We prove that if L splits off two hyperbolic planes and is of sufficiently large rank, then the lift is injective. As an application, we deduce that the image of the lift in the degree 4 cohomology of the associated orthogonal Shimura variety has the same dimension as the lifted space of cusp forms. Our results also cover the case of moduli spaces of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces. To prove the injectivity, we introduce vector-valued indefinite Siegel theta functions of genus 2 and of Jacobi type attached to L. We describe their behavior with respect to the split of a hyperbolic plane in L. This generalizes results of Borcherds to genus higher than 1.</description>

      <title>Spectral Moment Formulae for $\hbox{GL}(3)\times \hbox{GL}(2)$ $\hbox{L}$-functions II: The Eisenstein Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is the second in a series, following Part I (Algebra Number Theory 18.10 (2024)) and preceding Part III (Math. Ann. 391.1 (2025)). We continue our investigation of spectral moments of $\hbox{GL}(3)\times \hbox{GL}(2)$ $\hbox{L}$-functions from the perspective of period integrals. Using an identity between two distinct periods for the $\hbox{GL}(3)$ Eisenstein series, we establish an exact Motohashi-type identity linking the shifted cubic moment of $\hbox{GL}(2)$ $\hbox{L}$-functions to the shifted fourth moment of $\hbox{GL}(1)$ $\hbox{L}$-functions. In addition, we offer a novel, intrinsic and automorphic account for the sources and symmetries of the full set of main terms for both moments, in agreement with the CFKRS Moment Conjectures (Proc. Lond. Math. Soc.(3) 91 (2005)).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kronecker observed that either all roots or only one root of a solvable irreducible equation of odd prime degree with integer coefficients are real. This gives a possibility to construct specific examples of equations not solvable by radicals. A relatively elementary proof without using the full power of Galois theory is due to Weber. We give a rather short proof of Kronecker's theorem with a slightly different argument from Weber's. Several modern presentations of Weber's proof contain inaccuracies, which can be traced back to an error in the original proof. We discuss this error and how it can be corrected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove analogues of the theorem of Green and Tao on linear constellations in primes, in which the primes under consideration are restricted by certain arithmetic conditions. Our first main result is conditional upon Hooley's Riemann hypothesis and imposes the extra condition that the primes have prescribed primitive roots. Our second main result is unconditional and imposes the extra condition that the primes have prescribed Artin symbols in given Galois number fields. In the appendix we present an application of the second result in inverse Galois theory.</description>

      <title>Translates of completely normal elements and the Morgan-Mullen conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denote by $\mathbb F_q$ the finite field of order $q$ and by $\mathbb F_{q^n}$ its extension of degree $n$. Some $a\in\mathbb F_{q^n}$ is called primitive if it generates the multiplicative group $\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$ and it is called $q^n/q$-normal if its $\mathbb F_q$-conjugates form an $\mathbb F_q$-basis of $\mathbb F_{q^n}$ if the latter is viewed as an $\mathbb F_q$-vector space. Furthermore, some $a\in\mathbb F_{q^n}$ is called $q^n/q$-completely normal if it is $q^n/q^d$-normal for all $d\mid n$. In this work we prove a new construction of sets of completely normal elements and, we establish, under conditions, the existence of elements that are simultaneously primitive and $q^n/q$-completely normal, covering some yet unresolved cases of a 30-year-old conjecture by Morgan and Mullen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an explicit surjectivity result for products of non-isotrivial, non-isogenous elliptic curves over a function field of arbitrary characteristic. This is by way of an isogeny degree bound in this setting, generated from bounds for elliptic curves by Griffon--Pazuki, and techniques originated by Serre and Masser--W\"{u}stholz in the number field setting. We apply our result to prove that most members of a family of products of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with no extra endomorphisms have no exceptional primes above a specified constant which depends neither on the elliptic curve factors nor on the dimension of the product.</description>

      <title>Minimal depth $K$-types for wild double covers and Shimura correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct some Iwahori types, in the sense of Bushnell-Kutzko, for the double cover of an almost simple simply-laced simply-connected Chevalley group $\widetilde{G}$ over any $2$-adic field. These types capture the covering group analog of the Bernstein block of unramified principal series.
  We also prove that the associated Hecke algebra essentially admits an Iwahori-Matsumoto (IM) presentation. The complete presentation is obtained for types $A_{r}$, $D_{2r+1}$, $E_{6}$, $E_{7}$; for the other types, some technical obstacles remain. Those Hecke algebras with the complete IM presentation are isomorphic to Iwahori-Hecke algebras of explicit linear Chevalley groups, giving rise to Shimura correspondences.
  Along the way, we show that the Iwahori type extends to a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup $\widetilde{K}\subseteq \widetilde{G}$. This extension has minimal depth among the genuine $\widetilde{K}$-representations and allows us to construct a finite Shimura correspondence, generalizing a result of Savin.</description>

      <title>The Skolem Problem in rings of positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Skolem Problem is decidable in finitely generated commutative rings of positive characteristic. More precisely, we show that there exists an algorithm which, given a finite presentation of a (unitary) commutative ring $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/I$ of characteristic $T &gt; 0$, and a linear recurrence sequence $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$, determines whether $(\gamma_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ contains a zero term. Our proof is based on two recent results: Dong and Shafrir (2025) on the solution set of S-unit equations over $p^e$-torsion modules, and Karimov, Luca, Nieuwveld, Ouaknine, and Worrell (2025) on solving linear equations over powers of two multiplicatively independent numbers. Our result implies, moreover, that the zero set of a linear recurrence sequence over a ring of characteristic $T = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is effectively a finite union of $p_i$-normal sets in the sense of Derksen (2007).</description>
