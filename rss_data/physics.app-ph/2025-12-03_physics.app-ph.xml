      <title>Simulations of zero pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers over riblets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We computationally study the response of zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) to streamwise step changes from a smooth wall to riblets (S-R), and vice versa (R-S). We consider triangular riblets with tip angle $90^o$ (T9), that increase drag, with viscous-scaled spacing $50$. A novel grid-generation approach is developed for unstructured spectral-element codes, consistent with the size of turbulent scales across the TBL. We generate a ZPG TBL upstream of the step change (with thickness $\delta_0$) with momentum thickness Reynolds number $Re_{\theta_0} \simeq 680$. The TBL departure from equilibrium due to the step change, and its subsequent relaxation, recall previous studies on step changes in surface roughness. Downstream of the R-S step change, the internal equilibrium layer thickness $\delta_{IEL}$ reaches $0.4 \delta_0$ within $12\delta_0$. However, downstream of the S-R step change $\delta_{IEL}$ reaches $0.4 \delta_0$ within $4\delta_0$. In all cases, $\delta_{IEL}$ does not reach the boundary layer thickness, even up to a distance of $45\delta_0$ downstream of the step change, owing to persistent history effects within the frozen wake region.</description>

      <title>Application of riblets to separating turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct direct numerical simulations of separating turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) over triangular riblets with tip angles $90^o$ (T9) and $60^o$ (T6). Our setup follows the separating TBL study of Wu et al.\ ({\it J. Fluid Mech.}, vol.\ 883, 2020, p.\ A45). An equilibrium zero pressure-gradient (ZPG) TBL is generated at a reference location, followed by imposition of a Gaussian suction profile to create a separation bubble. The ZPG TBLs over the riblets and the benchmark smooth case have matched momentum thickness Reynolds number $Re_{\theta_0} = 583$ (friction Reynolds number 224). We employ a well-validated spectral-element solver, and leverage its unstructured-grid nature to generate an optimal grid, based on the size of turbulent scales across the TBL. At the reference location, the T9 and T6 riblets respectively increase and reduce drag, with viscous-scaled spacings $52$ and $13$. We discover that for both riblet cases, the mean separation location occurs at a distance of $140\theta_0$ downstream of the reference location, $18\%$ shorter than the mean separation distance for the smooth case ($170\theta_0$). This outcome is related to the progressive enhancement of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) rollers over the riblets, owing to the continuous rise in the adverse pressure-gradient. The KH rollers penetrate into the turbulent separation bubble, with significantly larger size and coherence compared to their counterparts upstream of the mean separation location.</description>

      <title>Geant4 Modeling of Energy and Charge Deposition in Satellites Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding radiation effects in spacecraft components is critical for predicting long-term performance degradation. In this work, a Geant4 Monte Carlo model is developed to compute charge and energy deposition in satellite solar-cell materials exposed to electrons, protons, and X-ray environments. The model is validated against published experimental and computational benchmarks and shows strong agreement across multiple energy ranges. Power-density deposition profiles are then evaluated for a multi-layer solar-cell structure under blackbody soft X-rays, mono-energetic X-rays, and high-energy electrons. The results show that low-energy X-rays dominate damage in surface layers, while high-energy particles penetrate deeper into semiconductor and substrate layers, posing risk to electronic components. These findings highlight the importance of radiation-specific shielding strategies for space solar-cell design.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic nanopore to monitor in-pore chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solid-state nanopores, achieving reliable control over pore aperture opening and closing (gating) remains a major challenge. Gating can be driven by the applied voltage involving electrically tunable chemical reactions, achieved by selecting appropriate compounds within the nanopore volume. In particular, cyclic precipitation and dissolution of metal phosphates can be triggered by regulating cation transport through an applied transmembrane voltage, thereby enabling reversible pore gating. Under negative bias, metal phosphate precipitates form inside the pore, obstructing ion flow and reducing current. Switching the polarity dissolves the precipitates, restoring ionic conductance. This process effectively produces a nanofluidic diode characterized by a remarkably high rectification ratio. To probe these localized chemical reactions more directly, we employed a plasmonic nanopore that generates strong confined fields, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements within the nanopore volume during cyclic gating. These measurements not only validate the proposed in-pore chemistry but also highlight the potential of plasmonic nanopores as powerful tools for monitoring nanoscale chemical processes with high spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>A Novel Injection-Locked S-Band Oven Magnetron System Without Waveguide Isolators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel injection-locked S-band microwave oven magnetron system is proposed, analyzed, and experimented. The magnetron is considered as a two-port oscillator, and the filament structures of it are used as a port for injection locking. To our knowledge, it is the first time that microwaves have been injected through magnetron filaments. The microwave is injected into the magnetron filter box using a self-designed injection structure, entering the resonant cavity through filament leads. The intrinsic isolation between the magnetrons output and filament is utilized as an isolator. No waveguide circulators or couplers between the injection source and the magnetron were used in the system, resulting in low cost and compact injection locking. Two types of injection structures were performed. The maximum locking bandwidth of 0.7 MHz was achieved at an injection ratio of 0.2. The weight and volume of the proposed injection-locked magnetron system were reduced to 28% and 16%, respectively. The magnetron output is successfully locked by an external signal. The experiment results reveal that the proposed low-cost injection-locked oven magnetron system works reliably. It has significant potential applications for future microwave ovens with frequency-selective heating to improve both efficiency and uniformity.</description>

      <title>Combining Transport of Pendular Water with Wind-Assisted Interfacial Evaporation for Dewatering of Concentrated Slurry Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drying concentrated slurry waste is slow, particularly due to the entrapment and limited accessibility of water entrained between the particles in the slurry. A sailboat evaporator with a root-like structure is a new system that enables wind-assisted interfacial evaporation of concentrated particle slurries. In this work, we create access to the disconnected water pockets in concentrated slurry waste, facilitating faster water conduction and efficient evaporation at extremely high solid concentration. The evaporator's long roots effectively extracted water beneath 150 cm deep supernatant water layer. Through replantation of the evaporator to a separate location, an impressive evaporation rate (ER) of 4 kg/(m^2*h) close to 80 wt% solid concentration, a 25% increase to a non-replanted sample. Furthermore, long periods of efficient of evaporation was achieved even at high solid concentration through hydrodynamic flushing of roots. Outdoor experiments achieved substantial volumetric reduction, yielding dried residues with over 75 wt% solid concentration. These results underscore the system's reliable performance against highly concentrated slurries, yet to be by conventional industrial methods, including flocculation and tail-lift drying. The integration of renewable energy coupled with efficient enhancement techniques makes the sailboat evaporator a scalable and sustainable pathway for industrial wastewater dewatering.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Reasoning with Photonic Bayesian Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly influence safety-critical aspects of society, from medical diagnosis to autonomous mobility, making uncertainty awareness a central requirement for trustworthy AI. We present a photonic Bayesian machine that leverages the inherent randomness of chaotic light sources to enable uncertainty reasoning within the framework of Bayesian Neural Networks. The analog processor features a 1.28 Tbit/s digital interface compatible with PyTorch, enabling probabilistic convolutions processing within 37.5 ps per convolution. We use the system for simultaneous classification and out-of-domain detection of blood cell microscope images and demonstrate reasoning between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The photonic Bayesian machine removes the bottleneck of pseudo random number generation in digital systems, minimizes the cost of sampling for probabilistic models, and thus enables high-speed trustworthy AI systems.</description>

      <title>Mass transfer and water management in proton exchange membrane fuel cells with a composite foam-rib flow field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass transfer capability of reactants and hydrothermal management is important for the performance and durability of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In the conventional rib flow field, the oxygen transport is affected by the accumulation of under-rib liquid water which causes excessive concentration loss and limits cell performance. To improve the cell performance, a composite foam-rib flow field structure is proposed by combining the metal foam flow field and the conventional rib flow field. The proposed design is simulated by using a three-dimensional homogeneous non-isothermal numerical model. The results show that the composite foam-rib flow field, by improving the oxygen transfer and water removal capabilities under the ribs, can improve the oxygen concentration and current density without increasing the pumping power, thus improving the cell performance under different conditions. The key parameters of the composite foam-rib flow field are optimized. With the optimal metal foam filling ratio of 0.75 and porosity of 0.85, the peak power density and the limiting current density for the composite foam-rib flow field are higher than the conventional rib flow field by 5.20% and 22.68%.</description>

      <title>Accurate Modeling of Gate Leakage Currents in SiC Power MOSFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors (MOSFETs) enable high-voltage and high-temperature power conversion. Compared to Si devices, they suffer from pronounced gate leakage due to the reduced electron tunneling barrier at the interface between SiC and amorphous silicon dioxide (a-SiO$_2$). We develop a self-consistent, physics-based simulation framework that couples electrostatics, quantum tunneling, carrier transport, impact ionization, and charge trapping for both electrons and holes. The model quantitatively reproduces measured gate-current-voltage characteristics of SiC MOS capacitors over a wide temperature (80-573 K) range and a wide bias range without empirical fitting. Simulations reveal that conduction electrons in a-SiO$_2$ can trigger impact ionization, which generates electron-hole pairs, and leads to capture of holes in the oxide bulk, thereby enhancing gate leakage current. The framework captures these coupled processes across multiple orders of magnitude in time and field, providing predictive capability for oxide reliability. Although demonstrated for SiC devices, the methodology also applies to Si technologies that uses the same gate dielectric.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Point Dynamics in Photonic Time Crystals for Enhanced Optical Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian photonics offer singular sensitivity enhancements but have thus far been realized almost exclusively in spatially engineered platforms with fixed geometries and limited tunability. Here we extend EP physics into the temporal domain by introducing balanced gain--loss modulation in a photonic time crystal (PTC). A time-periodic refractive-index modulation $n(t)=n_{0}+\delta n\cos(\Omega t)$ generates an effective non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian that supports coalescence of quasi-eigenmodes in frequency space, constituting a genuine \textit{temporal exceptional point}. Using a reduced two-mode model for the dominant frequency sidebands, we derive a non-Hermitian dimer Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{PT}}(\Delta,\gamma,\kappa)$ that is strictly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric for $\Delta=0$ and identify the exact EP condition. Numerical analysis reveals the associated Riemann-sheet topology, mode exchange and Berry-phase accumulation upon encirclement of the EP, and the characteristic $\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ perturbation response indicative of enhanced sensing. We further construct a non-Hermitian transmission model that is exact within the reduced two-mode description, compute the Cram\'er--Rao bound (CRB) for temperature estimation under an explicit noise model, and show that EP-enhanced sensitivity persists when compared to a linewidth-matched Hermitian reference under identical resource constraints. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the CRB is saturable using spectral measurements. These results establish temporal non-Hermiticity as a new paradigm for dynamically reconfigurable, broadband, and geometry-independent exceptional-point photonics.</description>

      <title>New insights into hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking in nickel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the grain boundary (GB) susceptibility to hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking in pure nickel as a function of coincident site lattice value ($\Sigma$-n), over a wide range of hydrogen concentrations (4 to 14 wppm). Cracks on the surface and within the bulk material were identified across the entire gauge region of the specimens. The susceptibility of GBs to crack initiation and propagation was evaluated by separating cracks containing single GB or multiple GBs. A larger loss in fracture strain, a smaller reduction in area, and an increase in the percentage of intergranular fracture indicated a higher degree of embrittlement at elevated hydrogen concentrations. The number of cracks was significantly higher on the surface than in the bulk for the most severe hydrogen charging conditions ($\geq$ 8 wppm), while a similar number was observed for lower concentrations. The propensity for hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking at different types of GBs on the surface and in the bulk material was consistent, indicating that while cathodic charging can promote surface cracks, it does not significantly impact the GBs relative susceptibility. The $\Sigma$-3 boundaries were the most resistant to cracking, as evidenced by the considerably lower fraction of these GBs exhibiting intergranular cracking at all hydrogen concentrations considered. This contrasts literature findings for Ni alloys and can be explained by the segregation energies and reductions in the cohesive strength with hydrogen, with less favorable trapping at the $\Sigma$-3 boundaries. No evidence of plasticity-mediated cracking initiation was observed.</description>

      <title>Engineering Cryogenic FETs: Addressing SCEs and Impact of Interface Traps Down to 2 K Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and benchmarking of cryogenic bulk-FETs using an experimentally calibrated TCAD framework that integrates 2-D electrostatics and interface-trap effects from $T = 2$ K to 300 K. For a 28-nm node device, carrier transport is predominantly ballistic at $T = 2$ K and becomes quasi-ballistic as temperature increases. At cryogenic temperatures, higher interface-trap densities increase the effective threshold voltage and suppress subthreshold conduction. However, when the ON-state bias is adjusted to account for the trap-induced $V_t$ shift, interface traps are found to \emph{worsen} $I_{\mathrm{ON}}/I_{\mathrm{OFF}}$ along with degrading the subthreshold swing (SS) and reducing mobility across all temperatures. The spatial standard deviation $\sigma$ of the trap distribution modulates these behaviors: highly localized traps ($\sigma \sim 1$--$2$ nm) exacerbate short-channel effects (SCEs), whereas broader, nearly uniform distributions ($\sigma \ge 50$ nm) elevate the entire barrier and suppress SCEs until saturation as $\sigma \to L_g$. The TCAD predictions closely match experimental data at 4.2 K, 77 K, and 300 K, providing design guidelines to optimize $I_{\mathrm{ON}}/I_{\mathrm{OFF}}$, SS, mobility, and DIBL for cryogenic CMOS technology nodes.</description>

      <title>Second-Harmonic Magnetoacoustic Ultrasound from Magnetic Nanoparticles under Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report experimental evidence of mechanical wave generation by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) under radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs, 65mT, 800 kHz, at 100ms bursts) in the ultrasonic (US) frequency range. We developed an experimental setup to detect the second harmonic (SH) signal under isothermal conditions. This SH-US signal was observed only in samples containing MNPs and consequently originated from the EMF interaction on samples containing MNPs. These findings suggest that US generation due to magneto-acoustic interaction in the MNPs could be responsible for the cell damage induced by EMF in cells containing MNPs without increasing the temperature. Experiments performed on magnetically aligned MNP clusters in gelatin significantly enhance the amplitude of the SH signal compared to non-aligned samples. This phenomenon could pave the way for new theoretical and practical approaches as for 'in vivo' magnetoacoustics theragnostic.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength transparent microfluidics for UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray scattering studies of photoactive systems</title>

Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort-pulse-pumped, single-mode type-0 squeezers in lithium niobate nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present design principles for ultrashort-pulse, type-0 phase-matched optical parametric amplifiers to generate and measure spectrally pure degenerate squeezed light. We consider a fundamental signal (second-harmonic) mode at 2090 (1045) nm and show that our proposed design achieves a Schmidt number of $K \approx 1.02$ with squeezing levels greater than 15 dB on a single temporal mode spanning over $5$ THz in bandwidth with cm-scale devices on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) on insulator platform. Our work opens up promising avenues for large-scale circuits for ultrafast quantum information processing and quantum sensing applications on the rapidly advancing TFLN platform with already demonstrated linear components and photodetection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Distortion-Driven Carrier Decoupling in Doped LiMgPO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions and charge carriers governs the properties of many functional oxides. In alkali-doped LiMgPO4, a significant enhancement in dosimetric response is observed, but its microscopic origin is not understood. Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, we reveal a fundamental mechanism of carrier decoupling driven by a hierarchy of lattice distortions. We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage. These results present a clear physical picture of how multiscale lattice distortions can independently control electron and hole transport, offering new insights into the physics of polarons in complex materials.</description>
