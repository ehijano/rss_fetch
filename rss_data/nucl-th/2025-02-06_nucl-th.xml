      <title>Developing techniques for Simulation of SU(3) Quantum Field Theories on State-of-the-Art Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has long been an experimental technology with the potential to simulate, at scale, phenomena which on classical devices would be too expensive to simulate at any but the smallest scales. Over the last several years, however, it has entered the NISQ era, where the number of qubits are sufficient for quantum advantage but substantial noise on hardware stands in the way of this achievement. This thesis details NISQ device-centered improvements to techniques of quantum simulation of the out-of-equilbrium real-time dynamics of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) and of dense 3-flavor neutrino systems on digital quantum devices.
  The first project concerning LQCD is a comparison of methods for implementing the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) that initializes the ground state of an SU(3) plaquette-chain. The thesis then pivots to a 1+1D lattice of quarks interacting with an SU(3) gauge-field. A VQE-based state-preparation for the vacua and a Trotterized time-evolution circuit is designed and applied to the problems of simulating beta and neutrinoless double beta decay. Finally, these circuits are adapted to a version useable on quantum devices with nearest-neighbor connectivity with minimal overhead, with an eye towards utilizing the higher qubit count of such devices for hadron dynamics and scattering.
  This thesis covers two projects that concern dense 3-flavor neutrino systems. The first details design and testing of Trotterized time-evolution circuits on state-of-the-art quantum devices. The second, motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem's result that deviation from stabilizer states ("magic") is necessary for a problem to exhibit quantum advantage, details results with implications for the Standard Model in general that the 3 flavor ultradense neutrino systems with the highest, most-persistent magic are those that start with neutrinos in all 3 flavors.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum dependent factorisation in the target fragmentation region at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the differential cross-section for single-inclusive jet production with transverse momentum $P_\perp$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small Bjorken $x_{\rm Bj}$, mediated by a virtual photon with virtuality $Q^2$. Unlike most studies at small $x$, which focus on particle production in the current fragmentation region, we investigate the kinematic regime where the jet is produced in the target fragmentation hemisphere of the Breit frame, and with $P_\perp \ll Q$. For a longitudinally polarised photon, we demonstrate that this cross-section is not power suppressed in $P_\perp/Q$ and we derive a factorised expression in terms of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) quark and gluon fracture functions. Our formula, valid at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ at small $x$, is akin to the Altarelli-Martinelli identity for the longitudinal DIS structure function. Numerical estimates show that the quark TMD fracture function is the most sensitive to saturation effects in large nuclei.</description>

      <title>Theory of resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to the theory of resonances, focusing specifically on the spectrum of excited strongly interacting particles. After providing historical context starting from the atomic theory, we summarize the status of theoretical and experimental research. We discuss then the methodology to determine universal resonance parameter through the analytical properties of the transition amplitudes. For this, the main aspects of the $S$-matrix theory are introduced including some explicit calculations in simplified cases. In the last section, we summarize several frequently used amplitude types also making a connection to Effective Field Theories, as well as provide first glimpse into some more advanced applications to further resonance properties.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung photon contributions to parton energy loss at high virtuality ($Q^2$) : a perturbative calculation at $O(\alpha_{s} \alpha_{em})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, real photon production scattering rates from jet-medium interactions in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production off of highly virtual (and highly energetic) quarks, taking into account heavy quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128-170 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as used in the $e$-$A$ deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernel that goes beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams are classified based on the final state particles, and include four types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{em}\alpha_{s})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon (iii) virtual photon corrections to quark-antiquark pair production and (iv) virtual photon correction to quark-quark production. The collision kernel, thus derived, includes full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy quark mass effects, thus allowing to explore heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions, and the related jet transport coefficients, have the hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Baryon-Electric Charge Correlations and Chemical Potentials as Probes of Magnetized QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD results of quadratic fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD in the presence of a background magnetic field. The simulations were performed using the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks with physical pion mass $m_\pi$ = 135 MeV on $N_\tau=8$ and 12 lattices. We find that the correlation between net baryon number and electric charge, denoted as $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11} $, can serve as a magnetometer of QCD. At pseudocritical temperatures ($T_{pc}$) the $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ starts to increase rapidly with magnetic field strength $eB \gtrsim 2M^2_{\pi}$ and by a factor 2 at $eB\simeq 8 M^2_{\pi}$. By comparing with the hadron resonance gas model, we find that the $eB$ dependence of $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ is mainly due to the doubly charged $\Delta$(1232) baryon. Although the doubly charged $\Delta$(1232) could not be detected experimentally, its decay products, protons and pions, retain the $eB$ dependence of $\Delta$(1232)'s contribution to $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$. Furthermore, the ratio of electric charge chemical potential to baryon chemical potential, $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$, shows significant dependence on the magnetic field strength and varies with the ratio of electric charge to baryon number in the colliding nuclei in heavy ion collisions. These results provide baselines for effective theory and model studies, and both $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ could be useful probes for the detection of magnetic fields in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments as compared with corresponding results from the hadron resonance gas model.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary nature of the nucleon scalar charge and its densities as a signal of nontrivial vacuum structure of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely known that the nucleon scalar charge is proportional to the pion-nucleon sigma term as one of the important low energy observables of QCD. Especially interesting to us is the physics of the nucleon scalar charge densities. This comes from the fact that the corresponding operator has the same quantum number as the physical vacuum. It indicates unusual behavior of the the nucleon scalar density as a function of the distance $r$ from the nucleon center. Namely, it would not be reduced down to zero at the spatial infinity but rather approaches some nonzero constant corresponding to the vacuum quark condensate. Naturally, this unique nature of the nucleon scalar density in the position space also affects the corresponding density in the momentum space, i.e. the corresponding parton distribution function (PDF) as a function of the Bjorken variable $x$. This PDF is known as the chiral-odd twist-3 PDF $e (x)$. We argue that $e(x)$ is likely to have a delta-function type singularity at $x=0$, and that the appearance of this singularity can be interpreted as a signal of the nontrivial vacuum structure of the QCD.</description>

      <title>Applications of emulation and Bayesian methods in heavy-ion physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy-ion collisions provide a window into the properties of many-body systems of deconfined quarks and gluons. Understanding the collective properties of quarks and gluons is possible by comparing models of heavy-ion collisions to measurements of the distribution of particles produced at the end of the collisions. These model-to-data comparisons are extremely challenging, however, because of the complexity of the models, the large amount of experimental data, and their uncertainties. Bayesian inference provides a rigorous statistical framework to constrain the properties of nuclear matter by systematically comparing models and measurements.
  This review covers model emulation and Bayesian methods as applied to model-to-data comparisons in heavy-ion collisions. Replacing the model outputs (observables) with Gaussian process emulators is key to the Bayesian approach currently used in the field, and both current uses of emulators and related recent developments are reviewed. The general principles of Bayesian inference are then discussed along with other Bayesian methods, followed by a systematic comparison of seven recent Bayesian analyses that studied quark-gluon plasma properties, such as the shear and bulk viscosities. The latter comparison is used to illustrate sources of differences in analyses, and what it can teach us for future studies.</description>

      <title>An MLE-based analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to explore factorization and event-plane correlations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our analyses incorporate both numerical simulations and publicly available data from the CMS Collaboration. We focus on Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. The differential flows obtained for various centrality windows and momentum cuts are consistent with conventional methodologies such as multi-particle cumulants and event-plane methods. Leveraging these findings, we proceed to undertake further analysis of flow factorization and event-plane correlations. These quantities are relevant because of their sensitivity to initial-state fluctuations. While higher-order correlators might provide different implementations of factorization ratio, the MLE estimator is readily applied to these scenarios. Moreover, MLE's unique capabilities allow us to compute specific correlators that are typically inaccessible by other means. As an asymptotically normal and unbiased estimator, MLE provides a valuable alternative tool for flow and correlation analysis.</description>

      <title>Confronting new NICER mass-radius measurements with phase transition in dense matter and twin compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (re)analysis of data on the X-ray emitting pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and J0740+6620, as well as new results on PSR J0437-4715 and J1231-1411, are confronted with the predictions of the equation of state (EoS) models allowing for strong first-order phase transition for the mass-radius ($M$-$R$) diagram. We use models that are based on a covariant density functional (CDF) EoS for nucleonic matter at low densities and a quark matter EoS, parameterized by the speed of sound, at higher densities. To account for the variations in the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 obtained from different analyses, we examined three scenarios to assess their consistency with our models, focusing particularly on the potential formation of twin stars. We found that in two scenarios, where the ellipses for PSR J0030+0451 and J0437-4715 with masses close to the canonical mass $\sim 1.4\,M_{\odot}$ are significantly separated, our models allow for the presence of twin stars as a natural explanation for potential differences in the radii of these stars.</description>

      <title>Precise Mass Measurement of the Longest Odd-Odd Chain of \boldmath $1^+$ Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise mass measurements of the ground and isomeric states of the odd-odd $^{108, 110, 112, 114, 116}$Rh were performed using the Canadian Penning Trap at Argonne National Laboratory, showing good agreement with recent JYFLTRAP measurements. A new possible isomeric state of $^{114}$Rh was also observed. These isotopes are part of the longest odd-odd chain of identical ground-state spin-parity assignment of 1$^+$, spanning $^{104-118}$Rh, despite being in a region of deformation. Realistic phenomenological mean-field calculations using ``universal'' Wood-Saxon Hamiltonian were performed, which explained this phenomenon for the first time. In addition, multi-quasiparticle blocking calculations were performed to study the configuration of low-lying states in the odd-odd Rh nuclei, elucidating anomalous isomeric yield ratio observed for $^{114}$Rh.</description>
