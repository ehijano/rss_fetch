      <title>Intersection patterns in spaces with a forbidden homological minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.09286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study generalizations of classical results on intersection patterns of set systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$, such as the fractional Helly theorem or the $(p,q)$-theorem, in the setting of arbitrary triangulable spaces with a forbidden homological minor.
  Given a simplicial complex $K$ and an integer $b$, we say that a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subcomplexes of some simplicial complex $\mathcal{U}$ is a \emph{$(K,b)$-free cover} if (i) $K$ is a forbidden homological minor of $\mathcal{U}$, and (ii) the $j$th reduced Betti number $\tilde{\beta}_j(\bigcap_{S\in {\mathcal{G}}}S,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is strictly less than $b$ for all $0\leq j &lt; \dim K$ and all nonempty subfamilies $\mathcal{G}\subseteq \mathcal{F}$.
  We show that for every $K$ and $b$, the fractional Helly number of a $(K,b)$-free cover is at most $\mu(K)+1$, where $\mu(K)$ is the maximum sum of the dimensions of two disjoint faces in~$K$. This implies that the assertion of the $(p,q)$-theorem holds for every $p \ge q &gt; \mu(K)$ and every $(K,b)$-free cover $\mathcal{F}$. For $b=1$ and a suitable $K$ this recovers the original $(p,q)$-theorem and its generalization to good covers. Interestingly, our results show that that the range of parameters $(p,q)$ for which the $(p,q)$-theorem holds is independent of $b$.
  Our proofs use Ramsey-type arguments combined with the notion of stair convexity of Bukh et al. to construct (forbidden) homological minors in cubical complexes.</description>

      <title>A Survey and Benchmark of Automatic Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive survey and benchmark of both traditional and learning-based methods for surface reconstruction from point clouds. This task is particularly challenging for real-world acquisitions due to factors like noise, outliers, non-uniform sampling, and missing data. Traditional approaches often simplify the problem by imposing handcrafted priors on either the input point clouds or the resulting surface, a process that can necessitate tedious hyperparameter tuning. Conversely, deep learning models have the capability to directly learn the properties of input point clouds and desired surfaces from data. We study the influence of these handcrafted and learned priors on the precision and robustness of surface reconstruction techniques. We evaluate various time-tested and contemporary methods in a standardized manner. When both trained and evaluated on point clouds with identical characteristics, the learning-based models consistently produce superior surfaces compared to their traditional counterparts$\unicode{x2013}$even in scenarios involving novel shape categories. However, traditional methods demonstrate greater resilience to the diverse array of point cloud anomalies commonly found in real-world 3D acquisitions. For the benefit of the research community, we make our code and datasets available, inviting further enhancements to learning-based surface reconstruction.

      <title>Subexponential algorithms in geometric graphs via the subquadratic grid minor property: the role of local radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the existence of subexponential parameterized algorithms of three fundamental cycle-hitting problems in geometric graph classes. The considered problems, \textsc{Triangle Hitting} (TH), \textsc{Feedback Vertex Set} (FVS), and \textsc{Odd Cycle Transversal} (OCT) ask for the existence in a graph $G$ of a set $X$ of at most $k$ vertices such that $G-X$ is, respectively, triangle-free, acyclic, or bipartite. Such subexponential parameterized algorithms are known to exist in planar and even $H$-minor free graphs from bidimensionality theory [Demaine et al., JACM 2005], and there is a recent line of work lifting these results to geometric graph classes consisting of intersection of "fat" objects ([Grigoriev et al., FOCS 2022] and [Lokshtanov et al., SODA 2022]). In this paper we focus on "thin" objects by considering intersection graphs of segments in the plane with $d$ possible slopes ($d$-DIR graphs) and contact graphs of segments in the plane. Assuming the ETH, we rule out the existence of algorithms:
  - solving TH in time $2^{o(n)}$ in 2-DIR graphs; and
  - solving TH, FVS, and OCT in time $2^{o(\sqrt{n})}$ in $K_{2,2}$-free contact 2-DIR graphs.
  These results indicate that additional restrictions are necessary in order to obtain subexponential parameterized algorithms for %these problems. In this direction we provide:
  - a $2^{O(k^{3/4}\cdot \log k)}n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for FVS in contact segment graphs;
  - a $2^{O(\sqrt d\cdot t^2 \log t\cdot k^{2/3}\log k)} n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for TH in $K_{t,t}$-free $d$-DIR graphs; and
  - a $2^{O(k^{7/9}\log^{3/2}k)} n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for TH in contact segment graphs.</description>
