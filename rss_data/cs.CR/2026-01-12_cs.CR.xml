      <title>A Survey of Agentic AI and Cybersecurity: Challenges, Opportunities and Use-case Prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI marks an important transition from single-step generative models to systems capable of reasoning, planning, acting, and adapting over long-lasting tasks. By integrating memory, tool use, and iterative decision cycles, these systems enable continuous, autonomous workflows in real-world environments. This survey examines the implications of agentic AI for cybersecurity. On the defensive side, agentic capabilities enable continuous monitoring, autonomous incident response, adaptive threat hunting, and fraud detection at scale. Conversely, the same properties amplify adversarial power by accelerating reconnaissance, exploitation, coordination, and social-engineering attacks. These dual-use dynamics expose fundamental gaps in existing governance, assurance, and accountability mechanisms, which were largely designed for non-autonomous and short-lived AI systems. To address these challenges, we survey emerging threat models, security frameworks, and evaluation pipelines tailored to agentic systems, and analyze systemic risks including agent collusion, cascading failures, oversight evasion, and memory poisoning. Finally, we present three representative use-case implementations that illustrate how agentic AI behaves in practical cybersecurity workflows, and how design choices shape reliability, safety, and operational effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Multi-turn Jailbreaking Attack in Multi-Modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the security vulnerabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become a serious concern in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) research. These highly intelligent models, capable of performing multi-modal tasks with high accuracy, are also severely susceptible to carefully launched security attacks, such as jailbreaking attacks, which can manipulate model behavior and bypass safety constraints. This paper introduces MJAD-MLLMs, a holistic framework that systematically analyzes the proposed Multi-turn Jailbreaking Attacks and multi-LLM-based defense techniques for MLLMs. In this paper, we make three original contributions. First, we introduce a novel multi-turn jailbreaking attack to exploit the vulnerabilities of the MLLMs under multi-turn prompting. Second, we propose a novel fragment-optimized and multi-LLM defense mechanism, called FragGuard, to effectively mitigate jailbreaking attacks in the MLLMs. Third, we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed attacks and defenses through extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and closed-source MLLMs and benchmark datasets, and compare their performance with the existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Driven Multi-Turn Jailbreaking on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant threat from multi-turn jailbreak attacks, where adversaries progressively steer conversations to elicit harmful outputs. However, the practical effectiveness of existing attacks is undermined by several critical limitations: they struggle to maintain a coherent progression over long interactions, often losing track of what has been accomplished and what remains to be done; they rely on rigid or pre-defined patterns, and fail to adapt to the LLM's dynamic and unpredictable conversational state. To address these shortcomings, we introduce Mastermind, a multi-turn jailbreak framework that adopts a dynamic and self-improving approach. Mastermind operates in a closed loop of planning, execution, and reflection, enabling it to autonomously build and refine its knowledge of model vulnerabilities through interaction. It employs a hierarchical planning architecture that decouples high-level attack objectives from low-level tactical execution, ensuring long-term focus and coherence. This planning is guided by a knowledge repository that autonomously discovers and refines effective attack patterns by reflecting on interactive experiences. Mastermind leverages this accumulated knowledge to dynamically recombine and adapt attack vectors, dramatically improving both effectiveness and resilience. We conduct comprehensive experiments against state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The results demonstrate that Mastermind significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantially higher attack success rates and harmfulness ratings. Moreover, our framework exhibits notable resilience against multiple advanced defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Large Language Models through Iterative Tool-Disguised Attacks via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse applications, however, they remain critically vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful responses violating human values and safety guidelines. Despite extensive research on defense mechanisms, existing safeguards prove insufficient against sophisticated adversarial strategies. In this work, we propose iMIST (\underline{i}nteractive \underline{M}ulti-step \underline{P}rogre\underline{s}sive \underline{T}ool-disguised Jailbreak Attack), a novel adaptive jailbreak method that synergistically exploits vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms. iMIST disguises malicious queries as normal tool invocations to bypass content filters, while simultaneously introducing an interactive progressive optimization algorithm that dynamically escalates response harmfulness through multi-turn dialogues guided by real-time harmfulness assessment. Our experiments on widely-used models demonstrate that iMIST achieves higher attack effectiveness, while maintaining low rejection rates. These results reveal critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safety mechanisms and underscore the urgent need for more robust defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Memory Poisoning Attack and Defense on Memory Based LLM-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05504v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model agents equipped with persistent memory are vulnerable to memory poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious instructions through query only interactions that corrupt the agents long term memory and influence future responses. Recent work demonstrated that the MINJA (Memory Injection Attack) achieves over 95 % injection success rate and 70 % attack success rate under idealized conditions. However, the robustness of these attacks in realistic deployments and effective defensive mechanisms remain understudied. This work addresses these gaps through systematic empirical evaluation of memory poisoning attacks and defenses in Electronic Health Record (EHR) agents. We investigate attack robustness by varying three critical dimensions: initial memory state, number of indication prompts, and retrieval parameters. Our experiments on GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct models using MIMIC-III clinical data reveal that realistic conditions with pre-existing legitimate memories dramatically reduce attack effectiveness. We then propose and evaluate two novel defense mechanisms: (1) Input/Output Moderation using composite trust scoring across multiple orthogonal signals, and (2) Memory Sanitization with trust-aware retrieval employing temporal decay and pattern-based filtering. Our defense evaluation reveals that effective memory sanitization requires careful trust threshold calibration to prevent both overly conservative rejection (blocking all entries) and insufficient filtering (missing subtle attacks), establishing important baselines for future adaptive defense mechanisms. These findings provide crucial insights for securing memory-augmented LLM agents in production environments.</description>

      <title>Blockchain Verifiable Proof of Quantum Supremacy as a Trigger for Quantum-Secure Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that ensures transparency, security, and immutability through cryptographic techniques. However, advancements in quantum computing threaten the security of classical cryptographic schemes, jeopardizing blockchain integrity once cryptographic quantum supremacy is achieved. This milestone, defined here as the realization of quantum computers to solve practical cryptographic problems, would render existing security standards vulnerable, exposing blockchain assets (currency, data, etc.) to fraud and theft. To address this risk, we propose and implement a smart contract deployable on the Ethereum blockchain, having the ability to run applications on its blockchain, that generates classically intractable puzzles by probabilistically generating large, hard-to-factor numbers without requiring secret information. This contract then serves two purposes: to establish a mechanism (1) for a trustless, unbiased proof of cryptographic quantum supremacy by verifying solutions to these puzzles, and (2) to protect user funds on Ethereum by triggering quantum-secure fallback protocols upon detecting cryptographic quantum supremacy, since it is desirable to wait as long as possible to fall back to a quantum-secure scheme because of its inherent additional cost and complexity. These mechanisms demonstrate the ability to identify cryptographic vulnerabilities and ensure a smooth transition to quantum-secure standards, safeguarding blockchain assets in a post-quantum era.</description>

      <title>HogVul: Black-box Adversarial Code Generation Framework Against LM-based Vulnerability Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in software vulnerability detection have been driven by Language Model (LM)-based approaches. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit lexical and syntax perturbations, allowing critical flaws to evade detection. Existing black-box attacks on LM-based vulnerability detectors primarily rely on isolated perturbation strategies, limiting their ability to efficiently explore the adversarial code space for optimal perturbations. To bridge this gap, we propose HogVul, a black-box adversarial code generation framework that integrates both lexical and syntax perturbations under a unified dual-channel optimization strategy driven by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By systematically coordinating two-level perturbations, HogVul effectively expands the search space for adversarial examples, enhancing the attack efficacy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HogVul achieves an average attack success rate improvement of 26.05\% over state-of-the-art baseline methods. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid optimization strategies in exposing model vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Continual Pretraining on Encrypted Synthetic Data for Privacy-Preserving LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05635v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving privacy in sensitive data while pretraining large language models on small, domain-specific corpora presents a significant challenge. In this work, we take an exploratory step toward privacy-preserving continual pretraining by proposing an entity-based framework that synthesizes encrypted training data to protect personally identifiable information (PII). Our approach constructs a weighted entity graph to guide data synthesis and applies deterministic encryption to PII entities, enabling LLMs to encode new knowledge through continual pretraining while granting authorized access to sensitive data through decryption keys. Our results on limited-scale datasets demonstrate that our pretrained models outperform base models and ensure PII security, while exhibiting a modest performance gap compared to models trained on unencrypted synthetic data. We further show that increasing the number of entities and leveraging graph-based synthesis improves model performance, and that encrypted models retain instruction-following capabilities with long retrieved contexts. We discuss the security implications and limitations of deterministic encryption, positioning this work as an initial investigation into the design space of encrypted data pretraining for privacy-preserving LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/DataArcTech/SoE.</description>

      <title>The Echo Chamber Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a new generation of powerful chatbots that can be developed at relatively low cost. As companies deploy these tools, security challenges need to be addressed to prevent financial loss and reputational damage. A key security challenge is jailbreaking, the malicious manipulation of prompts and inputs to bypass a chatbot's safety guardrails. Multi-turn attacks are a relatively new form of jailbreaking involving a carefully crafted chain of interactions with a chatbot. We introduce Echo Chamber, a new multi-turn attack using a gradual escalation method. We describe this attack in detail, compare it to other multi-turn attacks, and demonstrate its performance against multiple state-of-the-art models through extensive evaluation.</description>

      <title>VIGIL: Defending LLM Agents Against Tool Stream Injection via Verify-Before-Commit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM agents operating in open environments face escalating risks from indirect prompt injection, particularly within the tool stream where manipulated metadata and runtime feedback hijack execution flow. Existing defenses encounter a critical dilemma as advanced models prioritize injected rules due to strict alignment while static protection mechanisms sever the feedback loop required for adaptive reasoning. To reconcile this conflict, we propose \textbf{VIGIL}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from restrictive isolation to a verify-before-commit protocol. By facilitating speculative hypothesis generation and enforcing safety through intent-grounded verification, \textbf{VIGIL} preserves reasoning flexibility while ensuring robust control. We further introduce \textbf{SIREN}, a benchmark comprising 959 tool stream injection cases designed to simulate pervasive threats characterized by dynamic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{VIGIL} outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic defenses by reducing the attack success rate by over 22\% while more than doubling the utility under attack compared to static baselines, thereby achieving an optimal balance between security and utility. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VIGIL-378B/.</description>

      <title>Influence of Parallelism in Vector-Multiplication Units on Correlation Power Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of neural networks in edge devices is increasing, which introduces new security challenges related to the neural networks' confidentiality. As edge devices often offer physical access, attacks targeting the hardware, such as side-channel analysis, must be considered. To enhance the performance of neural network inference, hardware accelerators are commonly employed. This work investigates the influence of parallel processing within such accelerators on correlation-based side-channel attacks that exploit power consumption. The focus is on neurons that are part of the same fully-connected layer, which run parallel and simultaneously process the same input value. The theoretical impact of concurrent multiply-and-accumulate operations on overall power consumption is evaluated, as well as the success rate of correlation power analysis. Based on the observed behavior, equations are derived that describe how the correlation decreases with increasing levels of parallelism. The applicability of these equations is validated using a vector-multiplication unit implemented on an FPGA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first method for change-point detection on encrypted time series. Our approach employs the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme to detect shifts in statistical properties (e.g., mean, variance, frequency) without ever decrypting the data. Unlike solutions based on differential privacy, which degrade accuracy through noise injection, our solution preserves utility comparable to plaintext baselines. We assess its performance through experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world time series from healthcare and network monitoring. Notably, our approach can process one million points within 3 minutes.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity AI: A Game-Theoretic AI for Guiding Attack and Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-driven penetration testing now executes thousands of actions per hour but still lacks the strategic intuition humans apply in competitive security. To build cybersecurity superintelligence --Cybersecurity AI exceeding best human capability-such strategic intuition must be embedded into agentic reasoning processes. We present Generative Cut-the-Rope (G-CTR), a game-theoretic guidance layer that extracts attack graphs from agent's context, computes Nash equilibria with effort-aware scoring, and feeds a concise digest back into the LLM loop \emph{guiding} the agent's actions. Across five real-world exercises, G-CTR matches 70--90% of expert graph structure while running 60--245x faster and over 140x cheaper than manual analysis. In a 44-run cyber-range, adding the digest lifts success from 20.0% to 42.9%, cuts cost-per-success by 2.7x, and reduces behavioral variance by 5.2x. In Attack-and-Defense exercises, a shared digest produces the Purple agent, winning roughly 2:1 over the LLM-only baseline and 3.7:1 over independently guided teams. This closed-loop guidance is what produces the breakthrough: it reduces ambiguity, collapses the LLM's search space, suppresses hallucinations, and keeps the model anchored to the most relevant parts of the problem, yielding large gains in success rate, consistency, and reliability.</description>

      <title>Agentic LLMs as Powerful Deanonymizers: Re-identification of Participants in the Anthropic Interviewer Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On December 4, 2025, Anthropic released Anthropic Interviewer, an AI tool for running qualitative interviews at scale, along with a public dataset of 1,250 interviews with professionals, including 125 scientists, about their use of AI for research. Focusing on the scientist subset, I show that widely available LLMs with web search and agentic capabilities can link six out of twenty-four interviews to specific scientific works, recovering associated authors and, in some cases, uniquely identifying the interviewees. My contribution is to show that modern LLM-based agents make such re-identification attacks easy and low-effort: off-the-shelf tools can, with a few natural-language prompts, search the web, cross-reference details, and propose likely matches, effectively lowering the technical barrier. Existing safeguards can be bypassed by breaking down the re-identification into benign tasks. I outline the attack at a high level, discuss implications for releasing rich qualitative data in the age of LLM agents, and propose mitigation recommendations and open problems. I have notified Anthropic of my findings.</description>

Abstract: Representing networks as a graph and training a link prediction model using benign connections is an effective method of anomaly-based intrusion detection. Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks. However, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-based approaches require large amounts of memory to train. In this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams--that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus--to the more modern transformer-based foundation models. Using language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers. The graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector. This new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods. This system, which we call CyberGFM, achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used network anomaly detection datasets, delivering a up to 2$\times$ improvement in average precision. We found that CyberGFM outperforms all prior works in unsupervised link prediction for network anomaly detection, using the same number of parameters, and with equal or better efficiency than the previous best approaches.</description>

      <title>When the Server Steps In: Calibrated Updates for Fair Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative distributed learning paradigm, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server without sharing their raw training data. While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>AIBoMGen: Generating an AI Bill of Materials for Secure, Transparent, and Compliant Model Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of complex AI systems has outpaced the development of tools to ensure their transparency, security, and regulatory compliance. In this paper, the AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM), an extension of the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), is introduced as a standardized, verifiable record of trained AI models and their environments. Our proof-of-concept platform, AIBoMGen, automates the generation of signed AIBOMs by capturing datasets, model metadata, and environment details during training. The training platform acts as a neutral, third-party observer and root of trust. It enforces verifiable AIBOM creation for every job. The system uses cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, and in-toto attestations to ensure integrity and protect against threats such as artifact tampering by dishonest model creators. Our evaluation demonstrates that AIBoMGen reliably detects unauthorized modifications to all artifacts and can generate AIBOMs with negligible performance overhead. These results highlight the potential of AIBoMGen as a foundational step toward building secure and transparent AI ecosystems, enabling compliance with regulatory frameworks like the EUs AI Act.</description>

      <title>PII-VisBench: Evaluating Personally Identifiable Information Safety in Vision Language Models Along a Continuum of Visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.</description>

      <title>StriderSPD: Structure-Guided Joint Representation Learning for Binary Security Patch Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vulnerabilities severely threaten software systems, making the timely application of security patches crucial for mitigating attacks. However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \textbf{\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \underline{Str}ucture-gu\underline{ide}d joint \underline{r}epresentation \underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark.</description>

      <title>Descriptor: Multi-Regional Cloud Honeypot Dataset (MURHCAD)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This data article introduces a comprehensive, high-resolution honeynet dataset designed to support standalone analyses of global cyberattack behaviors. Collected over a continuous 72-hour window (June 9 to 11, 2025) on Microsoft Azure, the dataset comprises 132,425 individual attack events captured by three honeypots (Cowrie, Dionaea, and SentryPeer) deployed across four geographically dispersed virtual machines. Each event record includes enriched metadata (UTC timestamps, source/destination IPs, autonomous system and organizational mappings, geolocation coordinates, targeted ports, and honeypot identifiers alongside derived temporal features and standardized protocol classifications). We provide actionable guidance for researchers seeking to leverage this dataset in anomaly detection, protocol-misuse studies, threat intelligence, and defensive policy design. Descriptive statistics highlight significant skew: 2,438 unique source IPs span 95 countries, yet the top 1% of IPs account for 1% of all events, and three protocols dominate: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Telnet, Server Message Block (SMB). Temporal analysis uncovers pronounced rush-hour peaks at 07:00 and 23:00 UTC, interspersed with maintenance-induced gaps that reveal operational blind spots. Geospatial mapping further underscores platform-specific biases: SentryPeer captures concentrated SIP floods in North America and Southeast Asia, Cowrie logs Telnet/SSH scans predominantly from Western Europe and the U.S., and Dionaea records SMB exploits around European nodes. By combining fine-grained temporal resolution with rich, contextual geolocation and protocol metadata, this standalone dataset aims to empower reproducible, cloud-scale investigations into evolving cyber threats. Accompanying analysis code and data access details are provided.</description>

      <title>Deepfake detectors are DUMB: A benchmark to assess adversarial training robustness under transferability constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake detection systems deployed in real-world environments are subject to adversaries capable of crafting imperceptible perturbations that degrade model performance. While adversarial training is a widely adopted defense, its effectiveness under realistic conditions -- where attackers operate with limited knowledge and mismatched data distributions - remains underexplored. In this work, we extend the DUMB -- Dataset soUrces, Model architecture and Balance - and DUMBer methodology to deepfake detection. We evaluate detectors robustness against adversarial attacks under transferability constraints and cross-dataset configuration to extract real-world insights. Our study spans five state-of-the-art detectors (RECCE, SRM, XCeption, UCF, SPSL), three attacks (PGD, FGSM, FPBA), and two datasets (FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF-V2). We analyze both attacker and defender perspectives mapping results to mismatch scenarios. Experiments show that adversarial training strategies reinforce robustness in the in-distribution cases but can also degrade it under cross-dataset configuration depending on the strategy adopted. These findings highlight the need for case-aware defense strategies in real-world applications exposed to adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Vulnerabilities of Federated Learning: A Deep Dive into Gradient Inversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving collaborative model training paradigm without sharing raw data. However, recent studies have revealed that private information can still be leaked through shared gradient information and attacked by Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA). While many GIA methods have been proposed, a detailed analysis, evaluation, and summary of these methods are still lacking. Although various survey papers summarize existing privacy attacks in FL, few studies have conducted extensive experiments to unveil the effectiveness of GIA and their associated limiting factors in this context. To fill this gap, we first undertake a systematic review of GIA and categorize existing methods into three types, i.e., \textit{optimization-based} GIA (OP-GIA), \textit{generation-based} GIA (GEN-GIA), and \textit{analytics-based} GIA (ANA-GIA). Then, we comprehensively analyze and evaluate the three types of GIA in FL, providing insights into the factors that influence their performance, practicality, and potential threats. Our findings indicate that OP-GIA is the most practical attack setting despite its unsatisfactory performance, while GEN-GIA has many dependencies and ANA-GIA is easily detectable, making them both impractical. Finally, we offer a three-stage defense pipeline to users when designing FL frameworks and protocols for better privacy protection and share some future research directions from the perspectives of attackers and defenders that we believe should be pursued. We hope that our study can help researchers design more robust FL frameworks to defend against these attacks.</description>

      <title>SRAF: Stealthy and Robust Adversarial Fingerprint for Copyright Verification of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The protection of Intellectual Property (IP) for Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical concern as model theft and unauthorized commercialization escalate. While adversarial fingerprinting offers a promising black-box solution for ownership verification, existing methods suffer from significant limitations: they are fragile against model modifications, sensitive to system prompt variations, and easily detectable due to high-perplexity input patterns. In this paper, we propose SRAF, which employs a multi-task adversarial optimization strategy that jointly optimizes fingerprints across homologous model variants and diverse chat templates, allowing the fingerprint to anchor onto invariant decision boundary features. Furthermore, we introduce a Perplexity Hiding technique that embeds adversarial perturbations within Markdown tables, effectively aligning the prompt's statistics with natural language to evade perplexity-based detection. Experiments on Llama-2 variants demonstrate SRAF's superior robustness and stealthiness compared to state-of-the-art baselines, offering a practical black-box solution for ownership verification.</description>

      <title>LLMs as verification oracles for Solidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the correctness of smart contracts is critical, as even subtle flaws can lead to severe financial losses. While bug detection tools able to spot common vulnerability patterns can serve as a first line of defense, most real-world exploits and losses stem from errors in the contract business logic. Formal verification tools such as SolCMC and the Certora Prover address this challenge, but their impact remains limited by steep learning curves and restricted specification languages. Recent works have begun to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection and test generation. Yet, a fundamental question remains open: can LLMs aid in assessing the validity of arbitrary contract-specific properties? In this paper, we provide the first systematic empirical evaluation of GPT-5, a state-of-the-art reasoning LLM, in this role. We benchmark its performance on a large dataset of verification tasks, compare its outputs against those of established formal verification tools, and assess its practical effectiveness in real-world auditing scenarios. Our study combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis, and shows that recent reasoning-oriented LLMs - although lacking soundness guarantees - can be surprisingly effective at predicting the (in)validity of complex properties, suggesting a new frontier in the convergence of AI and formal methods for secure smart contract development and auditing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting sensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly challenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles and permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data sharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of sensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen overall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on visual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically detected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data repository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision (10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1 second per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.</description>

      <title>Measuring Memecoin Fragility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memecoins, emerging from internet culture and community-driven narratives, have rapidly evolved into a unique class of crypto assets. Unlike technology-driven cryptocurrencies, their market dynamics are primarily shaped by viral social media diffusion, celebrity influence, and speculative capital inflows. To capture the distinctive vulnerabilities of these ecosystems, we present the first Memecoin Ecosystem Fragility Framework (ME2F). ME2F formalizes memecoin risks in three dimensions: i) Volatility Dynamics Score capturing persistent and extreme price swings together with spillover from base chains; ii) Whale Dominance Score quantifying ownership concentration among top holders; and iii) Sentiment Amplification Score measuring the impact of attention-driven shocks on market stability. We apply ME2F to representative tokens (over 65% market share) and show that fragility is not evenly distributed across the ecosystem. Politically themed tokens such as TRUMP, MELANIA, and LIBRA concentrate the highest risks, combining volatility, ownership concentration, and sensitivity to sentiment shocks. Established memecoins such as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE fall into an intermediate range. Benchmark tokens ETH and SOL remain consistently resilient due to deeper liquidity and institutional participation. Our findings provide the first ecosystem-level evidence of memecoin fragility and highlight governance implications for enhancing market resilience in the Web3 era.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Bridge On-chain and Off-chain Transparency in Stablecoins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stablecoins such as USDT and USDC aspire to peg stability by coupling issuance controls with reserve attestations. In practice, however, the transparency is split across two worlds: verifiable on-chain traces and off-chain disclosures locked in unstructured text that are unconnected. We introduce a large language model (LLM)-based automated framework that bridges these two dimensions by aligning on-chain issuance data with off-chain disclosure statements. First, we propose an integrative framework using LLMs to capture and analyze on- and off-chain data through document parsing and semantic alignment, extracting key financial indicators from issuer attestations and mapping them to corresponding on-chain metrics. Second, we integrate multi-chain issuance records and disclosure documents within a model context protocol (MCP) framework that standardizes LLMs access to both quantitative market data and qualitative disclosure narratives. This framework enables unified retrieval and contextual alignment across heterogeneous stablecoin information sources and facilitates consistent analysis. Third, we demonstrate the capability of LLMs to operate across heterogeneous data modalities in blockchain analytics, quantifying discrepancies between reported and observed circulation and examining their implications for cross-chain transparency and price dynamics. Our findings reveal systematic gaps between disclosed and verifiable data, showing that LLM-assisted analysis enhances cross-modal transparency and supports automated, data-driven auditing in decentralized finance (DeFi).</description>

      <title>PromptScreen: Efficient Jailbreak Mitigation Using Semantic Linear Classification in a Multi-Staged Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks pose persistent security challenges to large language model (LLM)-based systems. We present PromptScreen, an efficient and systematically evaluated defense architecture that mitigates these threats through a lightweight, multi-stage pipeline. Its core component is a semantic filter based on text normalization, TF-IDF representations, and a Linear SVM classifier. Despite its simplicity, this module achieves 93.4% accuracy and 96.5% specificity on held-out data, substantially reducing attack throughput while incurring negligible computational overhead.
  Building on this efficient foundation, the full pipeline integrates complementary detection and mitigation mechanisms that operate at successive stages, providing strong robustness with minimal latency. In comparative experiments, our SVM-based configuration improves overall accuracy from 35.1% to 93.4% while reducing average time-to-completion from approximately 450 s to 47 s, yielding over 10 times lower latency than ShieldGemma. These results demonstrate that the proposed design simultaneously advances defensive precision and efficiency, addressing a core limitation of current model-based moderators.
  Evaluation across a curated corpus of over 30,000 labeled prompts, including benign, jailbreak, and application-layer injections, confirms that staged, resource-efficient defenses can robustly secure modern LLM-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Fast Deterministically Safe Proof-of-Work Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permissionless blockchains achieve consensus while allowing unknown nodes to join and leave the system at any time. They typically come in two flavors: proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS), and both are vulnerable to attacks. PoS protocols suffer from long-range attacks, wherein attackers alter execution history at little cost, and PoW protocols are vulnerable to attackers with enough computational power to subvert execution history. PoS protocols respond by relying on external mechanisms like social consensus; PoW protocols either fall back to probabilistic guarantees, or are slow.
  We present Sieve-MMR, the first fully-permissionless protocol with deterministic security and constant expected latency that does not rely on external mechanisms. We obtain Sieve-MMR by porting a PoS protocol (MMR) to the PoW setting. From MMR we inherit constant expected latency and deterministic security, and proof-of-work gives us resilience against long-range attacks. The main challenge to porting MMR to the PoW setting is what we call time-travel attacks, where attackers use PoWs generated in the distant past to increase their perceived PoW power in the present. We respond by proposing Sieve, a novel algorithm that implements a new broadcast primitive we dub time-travel-resilient broadcast (TTRB). Sieve relies on a black-box, deterministic PoW primitive to implement TTRB, which we use as the messaging layer for MMR.</description>

      <title>FlexProofs: A Vector Commitment with Flexible Linear Time for Computing All Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FlexProofs, a new vector commitment (VC) scheme that achieves two key properties: (1) the prover can generate all individual opening proofs for a vector of size $N$ in optimal time ${\cal O}(N)$, and there is a flexible batch size parameter $b$ that can be increased to further reduce the time to generate all proofs; and (2) the scheme is directly compatible with a family of zkSNARKs that encode their input as a multi-linear polynomial. As a critical building block, we propose the first functional commitment (FC) scheme for multi-exponentiations with batch opening. Compared with HydraProofs, the only existing VC scheme that computes all proofs in optimal time ${\cal O}(N)$ and is directly compatible with zkSNARKs, FlexProofs may speed up the process of generating all proofs, if the parameter $b$ is properly chosen. Our experiments show that for $N=2^{16}$ and $b=\log^2 N$, FlexProofs can be $6\times$ faster than HydraProofs. Moreover, when combined with suitable zkSNARKs, FlexProofs enable practical applications such as verifiable secret sharing and verifiable robust aggregation.</description>

      <title>A Critical Analysis of the Medibank Health Data Breach and Differential Privacy Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the 2022 Medibank health insurance data breach, which exposed sensitive medical records of 9.7 million individuals due to unencrypted storage, centralized access, and the absence of privacy-preserving analytics. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose an entropy-aware differential privacy (DP) framework that integrates Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with adaptive budget allocation. The design incorporates TLS-encrypted database access, field-level mechanism selection, and smooth sensitivity models to mitigate re-identification risks. Experimental validation was conducted using synthetic Medibank datasets (N = 131,000) with entropy-calibrated DP mechanisms, where high-entropy attributes received stronger noise injection. Results demonstrate a 90.3% reduction in re-identification probability while maintaining analytical utility loss below 24%. The framework further aligns with GDPR Article 32 and Australian Privacy Principle 11.1, ensuring regulatory compliance. By combining rigorous privacy guarantees with practical usability, this work contributes a scalable and technically feasible solution for healthcare data protection, offering a pathway toward resilient, trustworthy, and regulation-ready medical analytics.</description>

      <title>Transferability of Adversarial Attacks in Video-based MLLMs: A Cross-modal Image-to-Video Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01042v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-based multimodal large language models (V-MLLMs) have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in video-text multimodal tasks. However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models - a common and practical real-world scenario - remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal large language model (I-MLLM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and spatiotemporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. Additionally, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as a surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rate (AASR) of 57.98% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for Zero-Shot VideoQA tasks, respectively.</description>

      <title>Prompt Injection Vulnerability of Consensus Generating Applications in Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining traction as a method to generate consensus statements and aggregate preferences in digital democracy experiments. Yet, LLMs could introduce critical vulnerabilities in these systems. Here, we examine the vulnerability and robustness of off-the-shelf consensus-generating LLMs to prompt-injection attacks, in which texts are injected to amplify particular viewpoints, erase certain opinions, or divert consensus toward unrelated or irrelevant topics. We construct attack-free and adversarial variants of prompts containing public policy questions and opinion texts, classify opinion and consensus valences with a fine-tuned BERT model, and estimate Attack Success Rates (ASR) from $3\times3$ confusion matrices conditional on matching human majorities. Across topics, default LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, GPT-4.1 Nano, and Apertus 8B exhibit widespread vulnerability, with especially high ASR for economically and socially conservative parties and for rational, instruction-like rhetorical strategies. A robustness pipeline combining GPT-OSS-SafeGuard injection detection, structured opinion representations, and GSPO-based reinforcement learning reduces ASR to near zero across parties and policy clusters when restricting attention to non-ambiguous consensus outcomes. These findings advance our understanding of both the vulnerabilities and the potential defenses of consensus-generating LLMs in digital democracy applications.</description>

      <title>Securing the AI Supply Chain: What Can We Learn From Developer-Reported Security Issues and Solutions of AI Projects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and applications has led to an increasingly complex security landscape. Developers of AI projects must contend not only with traditional software supply chain issues but also with novel, AI-specific security threats. However, little is known about what security issues are commonly encountered and how they are resolved in practice. This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data. We reveal that many security issues arise from the complex dependencies and black-box nature of AI components. Notably, challenges related to Models and Data often lack concrete solutions. Our insights can offer evidence-based guidance for developers and researchers to address real-world security threats across the AI supply chain.</description>
