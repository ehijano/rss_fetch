      <title>Physical probability in the Everett interpretation and Bell inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I define a notion of locality LOC, closely modelled on the Bell principle of Local Causality, construed as the condition that single case probabilities cannot be modified by actions at spacelike separation. The new principle, like that of Bell, forces Bell inequalities, but with two loopholes: one is violation of measurement independence, known to Bell, but the other is non-uniqueness of remote outcomes, a loophole only for LOC, not for Local Causality. I also set out a theory of physical probability, applicable to the Everett interpretation, in which the Born rule is derived, and which therefore violates Bell inequalities. I show it is consistent with LOC. Surprisingly, both loopholes are exploited. I conclude not only that physical probability in the Everett interpretation involves no action at a distance, but that the observed violation of Bell inequalities is powerful evidence for many worlds.</description>

      <title>Noncontextual versus contextual interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feynman famously said that single-particle interference is ``a phenomenon which is impossible to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics.'' In this paper we show that some of the phenomenology of interference can be reproduced in a ``classical'' way, by reproducing the Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Tester (including their improved version) using an extension of the quantum simulation logic (QSL) formalism. Our result improves and simplifies a previous result by Catani \emph{et al}, which relies on a much more complicated extension involving a ``toy field theory.'' We also show that not all single-particle interference can be explained by such a simple extension (including that of Catani et al), by showing that Hofmann's three-path interferometer is ``nonclassical'' in a very specific sense: it violates a Kochen-Specker-noncontextual inequality. Given that both our extension of QSL and Catani et al's extension are \emph{noncontextual} -- so do not reproduce the contextual behaviour of Hofmann's three-path interferometer -- the behaviour of that interferometer is a proper example of a phenomenon that has in it the heart of quantum mechanics, according to Feynman.</description>

      <title>A Projective Algebra for Ansatz: Resolving Wigner's Puzzle and the Existence of External Realms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2266</link>
      <description>arXiv:1306.2266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural philosophy integrates scientific observation with abstract frameworks, often using a mathematical Ansatz to hypothesise about physical phenomena. Exploring the possibility of other universes, however, challenges assumptions that physical laws, like spacetime geometry, extend beyond our reality. This paper argues that mathematical abstractions, serving as a telescope beyond physical constraints, enable such reasoning. Through a projective algebra formalism (Section 4), we model the mechanism of Ansatz, abstractly describing physical objects. This yields a resolution to Wigner's unreasonable effectiveness via cardinality equivalence (Section 5) and clarifies terms like 'evidence' and 'existence' (Section 6) to align with the conventions used in physics. A Cantor-inspired paradox shows no universe can contain all mathematical abstractions (e.g., sets, numbers), as its power set exceeds it, necessitating an external abstract realm (Section 6.4). This logical necessity, which holds even in the context of alternative set theories like New Foundations, provides evidence for a minimal external universe as an abstract realm, supporting Mathematical Realism. This result is not specific to the formalism, as long as we accept that the principles of set theory are mathematically valid. As abstract entities elude empirical detection, logical evidence is apt, guiding future science and philosophy research and fostering interdisciplinary inquiry.</description>

      <title>Typical Quantum States of the Universe are Observationally Indistinguishable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish three impossibility results regarding our knowledge of the quantum state of the universe. Suppose the universal quantum state is a typical unit vector in a high-dimensional subspace $\mathscr{H}_0$ of Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, such as the low-entropy subspace defined by the Past Hypothesis. We show that: (1) Any particular observation is incapable of identifying the universal state vector in $\mathscr{H}_0$ or substantially reducing the set of possibilities. In other words, the overwhelming majority of possible state vectors are observationally indistinguishable from each other. (2) For any reasonably probable measurement outcome and for most pairs of vectors in $\mathscr{H}_0$, that outcome will not appreciably favor one vector over the other. (3) Bayesian updating on any measurement result, unless it is extraordinarily improbable, has a negligible effect on the initial uniform probability distribution over the states in $\mathscr{H}_0$. These findings represent the most stringent epistemic constraints known for a quantum universe and are derived from a typicality theorem in quantum statistical mechanics. We close by considering how theoretical considerations beyond empirical evidence might inform our understanding of this fact and our knowledge of the universal quantum state.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</description>
