      <title>On the removal of the barotropic condition in helicity studies of the compressible Euler and ideal compressible MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The helicity is a topological conserved quantity of the Euler equations which imposes significant constraints on the dynamics of vortex lines. In the compressible setting the conservation law only holds under the assumption that the pressure is barotropic. We show that by introducing a new definition of helicity density $h_{\rho}=(\rho\textbf{u})\cdot\mbox{curl}\,(\rho\textbf{u})$ this assumption on the pressure can be removed, although $\int_V h_{\rho}dV$ is no longer conserved. However, we show for the non-barotropic compressible Euler equations that the new helicity density $h_{\rho}$ obeys an entropy-type relation (in the sense of hyperbolic conservation laws) whose flux $\textbf{J}_{\rho}$ contains all the pressure terms and whose source involves the potential vorticity $q = \omega \cdot \nabla \rho$. Therefore the rate of change of $\int_V h_{\rho}dV$ no longer depends on the pressure and is easier to analyse, as it only depends on the potential vorticity and kinetic energy as well as $\mbox{div}\,\textbf{u}$. This result also carries over to the inhomogeneous incompressible Euler equations for which the potential vorticity $q$ is a material constant. Therefore $q$ is bounded by its initial value $q_{0}=q(\textbf{x},\,0)$, which enables us to define an inverse resolution length scale $\lambda_{H}^{-1}$ whose upper bound is found to be proportional to $\|q_{0}\|_{\infty}^{2/7}$. In a similar manner, we also introduce a new cross-helicity density for the ideal non-barotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations.</description>

      <title>Spectral-statistics properties of the experimental and theoretical light baryon and meson spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the statistical fluctuation properties of the baryon and meson experimental mass spectra with those obtained from theoretical models (quark models and lattice QCD). We find that for the experimental spectra the statistical properties are close to those predicted by Random Matrix Theory for chaotic systems, while for the theoretical ones they are in general closer to those predicted for integrable systems and safely incompatible with those of chaotic systems. We stress the importance of the agreement of the fluctuation properties between experiment and theoretical models, as they determine the dynamical regime and the complexity of the real interactions. We emphasize the new statistical method we use, adapted for properly analyzing the fluctuation properties for very short spectral sequences.</description>

      <title>Mathematically established chaos and forecast of statistics with recurrent patterns in Taylor-Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to chaos in the subcritical regime of counter-rotating Taylor-Couette flow is investigated using a minimal periodic domain capable of sustaining coherent structures. Following a Feigenbaum cascade, the dynamics are found to be remarkably well approximated by a simple discrete map that admits rigorous proof of its chaotic nature. The chaotic set that arises for the map features densely distributed periodic points that are in one-to-one correspondence with unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) of the Navier-Stokes system. This supports the increasingly accepted view that UPOs may serve as the backbone of turbulence and, indeed, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct every statistical property of chaotic fluid flow from UPOs.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</description>
