      <title>Analysis of Kernel Mirror Prox for Measure Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By choosing a suitable function space as the dual to the non-negative measure cone, we study in a unified framework a class of functional saddle-point optimization problems, which we term the Mixed Functional Nash Equilibrium (MFNE), that underlies several existing machine learning algorithms, such as implicit generative models, distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and Wasserstein barycenters. We model the saddle-point optimization dynamics as an interacting Fisher-Rao-RKHS gradient flow when the function space is chosen as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). As a discrete time counterpart, we propose a primal-dual kernel mirror prox (KMP) algorithm, which uses a dual step in the RKHS, and a primal entropic mirror prox step. We then provide a unified convergence analysis of KMP in an infinite-dimensional setting for this class of MFNE problems, which establishes a convergence rate of $O(1/N)$ in the deterministic case and $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ in the stochastic case, where $N$ is the iteration counter. As a case study, we apply our analysis to DRO, providing algorithmic guarantees for DRO robustness and convergence.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop Equilibria for Mean-Field Games in Randomly Switching Environments with General Discounting Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to finding the closed-loop equilibria for a class of mean-field games (MFGs) with infinitely many symmetric players in a common switching environment when the cost functional is under general discount in time. There are two key challenges in the application of the well-known Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck (HJB-FP) approach to our problems: the path-dependence due to the conditional mean-field interaction and the time-inconsistency due to the general discounting cost. To overcome the difficulties, a theory for a class of systems of path-dependent equilibrium Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations (HJBs) is developed. Then closed-loop equilibrium strategies can be identified through a two-step verification procedure. It should be noted that the closed-loop equilibrium strategies obtained satisfy a new form of local optimality in the Nash sense. The theory obtained extends the HJB-FP approach for classical MFGs to more general conditional MFGs with general discounting costs.</description>

      <title>On Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Mean Semi-Absolute Deviation Portfolio Model: Robust Selection and Efficient Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the Wasserstein distributionally robust mean-lower semi-absolute deviation (DR-MLSAD) model, where the ambiguity set is a Wasserstein ball centered on the empirical distribution of the training sample. This model can be equivalently transformed into a convex problem. We develop a robust Wasserstein profile inference (RWPI) approach to determine the size of the Wasserstein radius for DR-MLSAD model. We also design an efficient proximal point dual semismooth Newton (PpdSsn) algorithm for the reformulated equivalent model. In numerical experiments, we compare the DR-MLSAD model with the radius selected by the RWPI approach to the DR-MLSAD model with the radius selected by cross-validation, the sample average approximation (SAA) of the MLSAD model, and the 1/N strategy on the real market datasets. Numerical results show that our model has better out-of-sample performance in most cases. Furthermore, we compare PpdSsn algorithm with first-order algorithms and Gurobi solver on random data. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of PpdSsn in solving large-scale DR-MLSAD problems.</description>

      <title>A New Class of Compact Formulations for Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel compact mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and a discretization discovery-based solution approach for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). We aim to solve the optimization problem efficiently by constraining the linear programming (LP) solutions to use only flows corresponding to time and capacity-feasible routes that are locally elementary (prohibiting cycles of customers localized in space).
  We employ a discretization discovery algorithm to refine the LP relaxation iteratively. This iterative process alternates between two steps: (1) increasing time/capacity/elementarity enforcement to increase the LP objective, albeit at the expense of increased complexity (more variables and constraints), and (2) decreasing enforcement without decreasing the LP objective to reduce complexity. This iterative approach ensures we produce an LP relaxation that closely approximates the optimal MILP objective with minimal complexity, facilitating an efficient solution via an off-the-shelf MILP solver.
  The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through empirical evaluations on classical VRPTW instances. We showcase the efficiency of solving the final MILP and multiple iterations of LP relaxations, highlighting the decreased integrality gap of the final LP relaxation. We believe that our approach holds promise for addressing a wide range of routing problems within and beyond the VRPTW domain.</description>

      <title>Stochastic linear quadratic optimal control problems with regime-switching jumps in infinite horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a stochastic linear-quadratic (SLQ, for short) control problem regulated by a time-invariant Markov chain in infinite horizon. Under the $L^2$-stability framework, we first study a class of linear backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE, for short) in infinite horizon. And then, we discuss the open-loop and closed-loop solvabilities of the SLQ problem. The open-loop solvability is characterized by the solvability of a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDE, for short) in infinite horizon and the convexity of the cost functional, and the closed-loop solvability is shown that to be equivalent to the open-loop solvability, which in turn is equivalent to the existence of a static stabilizing solution to the associated constrained coupled algebra Riccati equations (CAREs, for short). Using the Hilbert space method, we provide a sufficient verifiable condition to ensure the SLQ problem is solvable. Finally, we also solve a class of discounted SLQ problems and give two concrete examples to illustrate the results developed in the earlier sections.</description>

      <title>Lower-level Duality Based Reformulation and Majorization Minimization Algorithm for Hyperparameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is an important task of machine learning, which can be formulated as a bilevel program (BLP). However, most existing algorithms are not applicable for BLP with non-smooth lower-level problems. To address this, we propose a single-level reformulation of the BLP based on lower-level duality without involving any implicit value function. To solve the reformulation, we propose a majorization minimization algorithm that marjorizes the constraint in each iteration. Furthermore, we show that the subproblems of the proposed algorithm for several widely used hyperparameter turning models can be reformulated into conic programs that can be efficiently solved by the off-the-shelf solvers. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its superiority through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimization of 3-D flight trajectory of variable trim kites for airborne wind energy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skysails Power GmbH is the leading manufacturer of light and efficient power kites that harness the wind's untapped supplies at high altitudes, aiming at profoundly altering wind energy's impact in achieving the global energy transition. Novel, variable trim kites have been developed that allow to modulate the aerodynamic coefficients of the airborne system, significantly improving the overall system efficiency. The flight control of variable trim kites is much more complex than that of previous kite generations and its mastering is a challenge and one of the keys to a successful operation. Numerical optimization is applied to find a set of flight trajectories in order to maximize the energy production while satisfying several constraints on the system operating in a wide range of conditions. This industry abstract provides a general introduction of the trajectory optimization problem with variable trim kites. We also briefly introduce the state-of-the-art optimization setup. This is followed by demonstration of high-quality example results of the optimization. Finally, we discuss the results and their applications.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games Incorporating Carryover Effects: Optimizing Advertising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimal control problems that arise in connection with optimal advertising under uncertainty. Two main features appear in the model: a delay in the control variable driving the state dynamics; a mean-field term both in the state dynamics and in the utility functional, taking into account for other agents. We interpret the model in a competitive environment, hence we set it in the framework of Mean Field Games. We rephrase the problem in an infinite dimensional setting, in order to obtain the associated Mean Field Game system. Finally, we specify the problem to a simple case, and solve it providing an explicit solution.</description>

      <title>Continuous Approximations of Projected Dynamical Systems via Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projected Dynamical Systems (PDSs) form a class of discontinuous constrained dynamical systems, and have been used widely to solve optimization problems and variational inequalities. Recently, they have also gained significant attention for control purposes, such as high-performance integrators, saturated control and feedback optimization. In this work, we establish that locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics, involving Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), namely CBF-based dynamics, approximate PDSs. Specifically, we prove that trajectories of CBF-based dynamics uniformly converge to trajectories of PDSs, as a CBF-parameter is taken to infinity. Towards this, we also prove that CBF-based dynamics are perturbations of PDSs, with quantitative bounds on the perturbation. Our results pave the way to implement discontinuous PDS-based controllers in a continuous fashion, employing CBFs. Moreover, they can be employed to numerically simulate PDSs, overcoming disadvantages of existing discretization schemes, such as computing projections to possibly non-convex sets. Finally, this bridge between CBFs and PDSs may yield other potential benefits, including novel insights on stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for solving unconstrained discrete-time optimal control problems. Our method follows a direct multiple shooting approach, and consists of applying the SQP method together with an $\ell_2$ augmented Lagrangian primal-dual merit function. We use the LQR algorithm to efficiently solve the primal-dual SQP problem. As our algorithm is a specialization of NPSQP (Gill et al. 1992), it inherits its generic properties, including global convergence, fast local convergence, and the lack of need for second order corrections, improving on existing direct multiple shooting approaches such as GNMS (Giftthaler et al. 2018) and FDDP (Mastalli et al. 2020).</description>

      <title>Learning to Deliver: a Foundation Model for the Montreal Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Foundation Model for the Montreal Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (FM-MCVRP), a novel Deep Learning (DL) model that approximates high-quality solutions to a variant of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) that characterizes many real-world applications. The so-called Montreal Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MCVRP), first formally described by Bengio et al. (2021), is defined on a fixed and finite graph, which is analogous to a city. Each MCVRP instance is essentially the sub-graph connecting a randomly sampled subset of the nodes in the fixed graph, which represent a set of potential addresses in a real-world delivery problem on a given day. Our work exploits this problem structure to frame the MCVRP as an analogous Natural Language Processing (NLP) task. Specifically, we leverage a Transformer architecture embedded in a Large Language Model (LLM) framework to train our model in a supervised manner on computationally inexpensive, sub-optimal MCVRP solutions obtained algorithmically. Through comprehensive computational experiments, we show that FM-MCVRP produces better MCVRP solutions than the training data and generalizes to larger sized problem instances not seen during training. Even when compared to near-optimal solutions from state-of-the-art heuristics, FM-MCVRP yields competitive results despite being trained on inferior data. For instance, for 400-customer problems, FM-MCVRP solutions on average fall within 2% of the benchmark. Our results further demonstrate that unlike prior works in the literature, FM-MCVRP is a unified model, which performs consistently and reliably on a range of problem instance sizes and parameter values such as the vehicle capacity.</description>

      <title>Shifted Interpolation for Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy gradient descent and its variants are the predominant algorithms for differentially private machine learning. It is a fundamental question to quantify their privacy leakage, yet tight characterizations remain open even in the foundational setting of convex losses. This paper improves over previous analyses by establishing (and refining) the "privacy amplification by iteration" phenomenon in the unifying framework of $f$-differential privacy--which tightly captures all aspects of the privacy loss and immediately implies tighter privacy accounting in other notions of differential privacy, e.g., $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP and Renyi DP. Our key technical insight is the construction of shifted interpolated processes that unravel the popular shifted-divergences argument, enabling generalizations beyond divergence-based relaxations of DP. Notably, this leads to the first exact privacy analysis in the foundational setting of strongly convex optimization. Our techniques extend to many settings: convex/strongly convex, constrained/unconstrained, full/cyclic/stochastic batches, and all combinations thereof. As an immediate corollary, we recover the $f$-DP characterization of the exponential mechanism for strongly convex optimization in Gopi et al. (2022), and moreover extend this result to more general settings.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Array Encoding for Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: The transmit encoding model for synthetic aperture imaging is a robust and flexible framework for understanding the effect of acoustic transmission on ultrasound image reconstruction. Our objective is to use machine learning (ML) to construct scanning sequences, parameterized by time delays and apodization weights, that produce high quality B-mode images. Approach: We use an ML model in PyTorch and simulated RF data from Field II to probe the space of possible encoding sequences for those that minimize a loss function that describes image quality. This approach is made computationally feasible by a novel formulation of the derivative for delay-and-sum beamforming. We demonstrate these results experimentally on wire targets and a tissue-mimicking phantom. Main Results: When trained according to a given set of imaging parameters (imaging domain, hardware restrictions), our ML imaging model produces optimized encoding sequences that improve a number of standard quality metrics including resolution, field of view, and contrast, over conventional sequences. Significance: This work demonstrates that the set of encoding schemes that are commonly used represent only a narrow subset of those available. Additionally, it demonstrates the value for ML tasks in synthetic transmit aperture imaging to consider the beamformer within the model, instead of as purely post-processing.</description>

      <title>Polyamorous Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding schedules for pairwise meetings between the members of a complex social group without creating interpersonal conflict is challenging, especially when different relationships have different needs. We formally define and study the underlying optimisation problem: Polyamorous Scheduling.
  In Polyamorous Scheduling, we are given an edge-weighted graph and try to find a periodic schedule of matchings in this graph such that the maximal weighted waiting time between consecutive occurrences of the same edge is minimised. We show that the problem is NP-hard and that there is no efficient approximation algorithm with a better ratio than 13/12 unless P = NP. On the positive side, we obtain an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm. We also define a generalisation of density from the Pinwheel Scheduling Problem, "poly density", and ask whether there exists a poly density threshold similar to the 5/6-density threshold for Pinwheel Scheduling [Kawamura, STOC 2024]. Polyamorous Scheduling is a natural generalisation of Pinwheel Scheduling with respect to its optimisation variant, Bamboo Garden Trimming.
  Our work contributes the first nontrivial hardness-of-approximation reduction for any periodic scheduling problem, and opens up numerous avenues for further study of Polyamorous Scheduling.</description>

      <title>Inferring solar differential rotation and viscosity via passive imaging with inertial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of inertial waves on the surface of the Sun offers new possibilities to learn about the solar interior. These waves are long-lived with a period on the order of the Sun rotation period ($\sim$27 days) and are sensitive to parameters deep inside the Sun. They are excited by turbulent convection, leading to a passive imaging problem. In this work, we present the forward and inverse problem of reconstructing viscosity and differential rotation on the Sun from cross-covariance observations of these inertial waves.</description>

      <title>Epsilon-Greedy Thompson Sampling to Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) serves as a solution for addressing the exploitation-exploration dilemma in Bayesian optimization (BO). While it prioritizes exploration by randomly generating and maximizing sample paths of Gaussian process (GP) posteriors, TS weakly manages its exploitation by gathering information about the true objective function after each exploration is performed. In this study, we incorporate the epsilon-greedy ($\varepsilon$-greedy) policy, a well-established selection strategy in reinforcement learning, into TS to improve its exploitation. We first delineate two extremes of TS applied for BO, namely the generic TS and a sample-average TS. The former and latter promote exploration and exploitation, respectively. We then use $\varepsilon$-greedy policy to randomly switch between the two extremes. A small value of $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ prioritizes exploitation, and vice versa. We empirically show that $\varepsilon$-greedy TS with an appropriate $\varepsilon$ is better than one of its two extremes and competes with the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization is a critical tool for addressing a broad range of human and technical problems. However, the paradox of advanced optimization techniques is that they have maximum utility for problems in which the relationship between the structure of the problem and the ultimate solution is the most obscure. The existence of solution with limited insight contrasts with techniques that have been developed for a broad range of engineering problems where integral transform techniques yield solutions and insight in tandem. Here, we present a ``Pareto-Laplace'' integral transform framework that can be applied to problems typically studied via optimization. We show that the framework admits related geometric, statistical, and physical representations that provide new forms of insight into relationships between objectives and outcomes. We argue that some known approaches are special cases of this framework, and point to a broad range of problems for further application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work primarily focuses on an operator inference methodology aimed at constructing low-dimensional dynamical models based on a priori hypotheses about their structure, often informed by established physics or expert insights. Stability is a fundamental attribute of dynamical systems, yet it is not always assured in models derived through inference. Our main objective is to develop a method that facilitates the inference of quadratic control dynamical systems with inherent stability guarantees. To this aim, we investigate the stability characteristics of control systems with energy-preserving nonlinearities, thereby identifying conditions under which such systems are bounded-input bounded-state stable. These insights are subsequently applied to the learning process, yielding inferred models that are inherently stable by design. The efficacy of our proposed framework is demonstrated through a couple of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Reusing Historical Trajectories in Natural Policy Gradient via Importance Sampling: Convergence and Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning provides a mathematical framework for learning-based control, whose success largely depends on the amount of data it can utilize. The efficient utilization of historical trajectories obtained from previous policies is essential for expediting policy optimization. Empirical evidence has shown that policy gradient methods based on importance sampling work well. However, existing literature often neglect the interdependence between trajectories from different iterations, and the good empirical performance lacks a rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we study a variant of the natural policy gradient method with reusing historical trajectories via importance sampling. We show that the bias of the proposed estimator of the gradient is asymptotically negligible, the resultant algorithm is convergent, and reusing past trajectories helps improve the convergence rate. We further apply the proposed estimator to popular policy optimization algorithms such as trust region policy optimization. Our theoretical results are verified on classical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Underdamped Systems: An Analytic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control theory deals with finding protocols to steer a system between assigned initial and final states, such that a trajectory-dependent cost function is minimized. The application of optimal control to stochastic systems is an open and challenging research frontier, with a spectrum of applications ranging from stochastic thermodynamics, to biophysics and data science. Among these, the design of nanoscale electronic components motivates the study of underdamped dynamics, leading to practical and conceptual difficulties.
  In this work, we develop analytic techniques to determine protocols steering finite time transitions at minimum dissipation for stochastic underdamped dynamics. For transitions between Gaussian states, we prove that optimal protocols satisfy a Lyapunov equation, a central tool in stability analysis of dynamical systems. For transitions between states described by general Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, we introduce an infinite-dimensional version of the Poincar\'e-Linstedt multiscale perturbation theory around the overdamped limit. This technique fundamentally improves the standard multiscale expansion. Indeed, it enables the explicit computation of momentum cumulants, whose variation in time is a distinctive trait of underdamped dynamics and is directly accessible to experimental observation. Our results allow us to numerically study cost asymmetries in expansion and compression processes and make predictions for inertial corrections to optimal protocols in the Landauer erasure problem at the nanoscale.</description>

Abstract: Implicit-depth neural networks have grown as powerful alternatives to traditional networks in various applications in recent years. However, these models often lack guarantees of existence and uniqueness, raising stability, performance, and reproducibility issues. In this paper, we present a new analysis of the existence and uniqueness of fixed points for implicit-depth neural networks based on the concept of subhomogeneous operators and the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. Compared to previous similar analyses, our theory allows for weaker assumptions on the parameter matrices, thus yielding a more flexible framework for well-defined implicit networks. We illustrate the performance of the resulting subhomogeneous networks on feed-forward, convolutional, and graph neural network examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for parameter-free stochastic convex optimization (SCO) whose rate of convergence is only a double-logarithmic factor larger than the optimal rate for the corresponding known-parameter setting. In contrast, the best previously known rates for parameter-free SCO are based on online parameter-free regret bounds, which contain unavoidable excess logarithmic terms compared to their known-parameter counterparts. Our algorithm is conceptually simple, has high-probability guarantees, and is also partially adaptive to unknown gradient norms, smoothness, and strong convexity. At the heart of our results is a novel parameter-free certificate for SGD step size choice, and a time-uniform concentration result that assumes no a-priori bounds on SGD iterates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The function that maps a family of probability measures to the solution of the dual entropic optimal transport problem is known as the Schr\"odinger map. We prove that when the cost function is $\mathcal{C}^{k+1}$ with $k\in \mathbb{N}^*$ then this map is Lipschitz continuous from the $L^2$-Wasserstein space to the space of $\mathcal{C}^k$ functions. Our result holds on compact domains and covers the multi-marginal case. We also include regularity results under negative Sobolev metrics weaker than Wasserstein under stronger smoothness assumptions on the cost. As applications, we prove displacement smoothness of the entropic optimal transport cost and the well-posedness of certain Wasserstein gradient flows involving this functional, including the Sinkhorn divergence and a multi-species system.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies an infinite horizon optimal control problem for discrete-time linear system and quadratic criteria, both with random parameters which are independent and identically distributed with respect to time. In this general setting, we apply the policy gradient method, a reinforcement learning technique, to search for the optimal control without requiring knowledge of statistical information of the parameters. We investigate the sub-Gaussianity of the state process and establish global linear convergence guarantee for this approach based on assumptions that are weaker and easier to verify compared to existing results. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate our result.</description>

      <title>New Characterizations and Efficient Local Search for General Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00188v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integer linear programming (ILP) models a wide range of practical combinatorial optimization problems and significantly impacts industry and management sectors. This work proposes new characterizations of ILP with the concept of boundary solutions. Motivated by the new characterizations, we develop a new local search algorithm Local-ILP, which is efficient for solving general ILP validated on a large heterogeneous problem dataset. We propose a new local search framework that switches between three modes, namely Search, Improve, and Restore modes. Two new operators are proposed, namely the tight move and the lift move operators, which are associated with appropriate scoring functions. Different modes apply different operators to realize different search strategies and the algorithm switches between three modes according to the current search state. Putting these together, we develop a local search ILP solver called Local-ILP. Experiments conducted on the MIPLIB dataset show the effectiveness of our algorithm in solving large-scale hard ILP problems. In the aspect of finding a good feasible solution quickly, Local-ILP is competitive and complementary to the state-of-the-art commercial solver Gurobi and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art non-commercial solver SCIP. Moreover, our algorithm establishes new records for 6 MIPLIB open instances. The theoretical analysis of our algorithm is also presented, which shows our algorithm could avoid visiting unnecessary regions.</description>

      <title>Small-time controllability for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^N$ via bilinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the small-time controllability problem for a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on $\mathbb{R}^N$ in the presence of magnetic and electric external fields. We choose a particular framework where the equation becomes $i\partial_t \psi = [-\Delta+u_0(t)h_{\vec{0}}+\langle u(t), P\rangle +\kappa|\psi|^{2p}]\psi$. Here, the control operators are defined by the zeroth Hermite function $h_{\vec{0}}(x)$ and the momentum operator $P=i\nabla$. In detail, we study when it is possible to control the dynamics of (NLS) as fast as desired via sufficiently large control signals $u_0$ and $u$. We first show the existence of a family of quantum states for which this property is verified. Secondly, by considering some specific states belonging to this family, as a physical consequence we show the capability of controlling arbitrary changes of energy in bounded regions of the quantum system, in time zero. Our results are proved by exploiting the idea that the nonlinear term in (NLS) is only a perturbation of the linear problem when the time is as small as desired. The core of the proof, then, is the controllability of the bilinear equation which is tackled by using specific non-commutativity properties of infinite-dimensional propagators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits a class of convex Finite-Sum Coupled Compositional Stochastic Optimization (cFCCO) problems with many applications, including group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO), learning with imbalanced data, reinforcement learning, and learning to rank. To better solve these problems, we introduce an efficient single-loop primal-dual block-coordinate proximal algorithm, dubbed ALEXR. This algorithm leverages block-coordinate stochastic mirror ascent updates for the dual variable and stochastic proximal gradient descent updates for the primal variable. We establish the convergence rates of ALEXR in both convex and strongly convex cases under smoothness and non-smoothness conditions of involved functions, which not only improve the best rates in previous works on smooth cFCCO problems but also expand the realm of cFCCO for solving more challenging non-smooth problems such as the dual form of GDRO. Finally, we present lower complexity bounds to demonstrate that the convergence rates of ALEXR are optimal among first-order block-coordinate stochastic algorithms for the considered class of cFCCO problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates the fundamental convergence properties of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), a recently proposed gradient-based optimization method (Foret et al., 2021) that significantly improves the generalization of deep neural networks. The convergence properties including the stationarity of accumulation points, the convergence of the sequence of gradients to the origin, the sequence of function values to the optimal value, and the sequence of iterates to the optimal solution are established for the method. The universality of the provided convergence analysis based on inexact gradient descent frameworks (Khanh et al., 2023b) allows its extensions to the normalized versions of SAM such as VaSSO (Li &amp; Giannakis, 2023), RSAM (Liu et al., 2022), and to the unnormalized versions of SAM such as USAM (Andriushchenko &amp; Flammarion, 2022). Numerical experiments are conducted on classification tasks using deep learning models to confirm the practical aspects of our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the representation of partial differential equations (PDEs) as abstract differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) with dissipative Hamiltonian structure (adHDAEs). We show that these systems not only arise when there are constraints coming from the underlying physics, but many standard PDE models can be seen as an adHDAE on an extended state space. This reflects the fact that models often include closure relations and structural properties. We present a unifying operator theoretic approach to analyze the properties of such operator equations and illustrate this by several applications.</description>
