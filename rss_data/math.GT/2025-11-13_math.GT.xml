      <title>Foliation surgeries and the concordance groups of foliated spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a general procedure extending surgery to manifolds with foliation or Haefliger structure, the resulting Haefliger structure defined on the underlying surgered manifold. We find a single obstruction, whose vanishing characterizes the existence of a foliation surgery along an attaching sphere. When unobstructed, the resulting Haefliger structure can be chosen so that characteristic numbers are unchanged. Moreover, the obstructions are highly tractable for attaching spheres of dimension small relative the foliation codimension. This allows us to show that on every stably trivial manifold of dimension \( n \le 2q+2 \), a codimension-\( q \) Haefliger structure with trivial normal bundle admits a sequence of foliation surgeries to a Haefliger structure on the sphere \( S^{n} \), characteristic numbers unchanged.
  The obstruction always vanishes for \( 0 \)-sphere surgeries. It follows that the foliation connected sum gives, for each sphere \( S^{n} \) and codimension \( q \), a group structure on the set of concordance classes of transversely oriented Haefliger structures on \( S^{n} \). The resulting groups may be identified with the homotopy groups of the Haefliger classifying spaces \( B\Gamma^{+}_{q} \). Using this, we recover a result of Hurder that \( \pi_{2q+1}(B\Gamma^{+}_{q}) \) surjects onto a vector space of positive dimension for each codimension \( q \). We also apply the techniques here to a construction of Thurston's, to construct explicit Haefliger structures on \( (2q+1) \)-spheres whose Godbillon-Vey numbers surject to the real line.</description>

      <title>Alexander-Markov correspondence for doodles on closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce twisted virtual doodles, defined as stable equivalence classes of immersed circles on closed surfaces that may be non-orientable. These objects admit planar representative diagrams, considered up to a suitable set of Reidemeister-type moves. To develop the associated braid-theoretic framework, we define twisted virtual twin groups as natural extensions of virtual twin groups, and establish Alexander- and Markov-type theorems in this set-up. This shows that twisted virtual doodles unify and extend both classical and virtual doodle theories. We further investigate the structure of the pure twisted virtual twin group, providing a presentation and deriving several structural and combinatorial properties. In particular, we obtain two interesting decompositions of the twisted virtual twin group and its pure subgroup, from which it follows that both groups have trivial center and are residually finite as well as Hopfian.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometric embeddings for shrinking maps from surfaces into the moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate shrinking maps from a cusped hyperbolic surface into the moduli space of closed Riemann surfaces. For such a map and its lift to the Teichm\"uller space, we consider whether they are quasi-isometric embeddings with respect to natural metrics like the Teichm\"uller distance and the intrinsic distance. Under a mild condition, we prove that these properties are characterised solely by the map's monodromy. These characterisations apply, in particular, to holomorphic maps.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of infinite circle patterns and convex polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Thurston pioneered the connection between circle packing (abbr. CP) and three-dimensional geometric topology, the characterization of CPs and hyperbolic polyhedra has become increasingly profound. Some milestones have been achieved, for example, Rodin-Sullivan \cite{Rodin-Sullivan} and Schramm \cite{schramm91} proved the rigidity of infinite CPs with the intersection angle $\Theta=0$. Rivin-Hodgson \cite{RH93} fully characterized the existence and rigidity of compact convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{H}^3$. He \cite{He} proved the rigidity and uniformization theorem for infinite CPs with $0\leq\Theta\leq \pi/2$. \cite{He} also envisioned that "in a future paper, the techniques of this paper will be extended to the case when $0\leq\Theta&lt;\pi$. In particular, we will show a rigidity property for a class of infinite convex polyhedra in the 3-dimentional hyperbolic space".
  The article aims to accomplish the work claimed in \cite{He} by proving the rigidity and uniformization theorem for infinite CPs with $0\leq\Theta&lt;\pi$, as well as infinite trivalent hyperbolic polyhedra. We will pay special attention to CPs whose contact graphs are disk triangulation graphs. Such CPs are called regular because they exclude some singular configurations and correspond well to hyperbolic polyhedra. We will establish the existence and the rigidity of infinite regular CPs. Moreover, we will prove a uniformization theorem for regular CPs, which solves the classification problem for regular CPs. Thereby, the existence and rigidity of infinite convex trivalent polyhedra are obtained.</description>

      <title>Properness and finiteness of totally geodesic submanifolds in the convex core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that in any geometrically finite rank-one manifold of infinite volume, every maximal totally geodesic submanifold of dimension at least two contained in the convex core is properly immersed and has finite volume. Moreover, there are only finitely many such submanifolds. This finiteness result, combined with the work of Bader-Fisher-Miller-Stover and of Gromov-Schoen, implies that any geometrically finite rank-one manifold with infinitely many maximal totally geodesic submanifolds of dimension at least two and of finite volume must be arithmetic.
  These results follow from rigidity theorems for totally geodesic submanifolds contained in the convex core of a geometrically finite manifold, whose proofs rely on deep results in unipotent dynamics and measure classification in the infinite-volume setting, due to Ratner, Dani-Margulis, and Mozes-Shah.</description>

      <title>On $7$-manifolds with $b_{2}=2$: diffeomorphism classification and nonconnected moduli spaces of positive Ricci curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the $s$-invariants of certain simply connected $7$-manifolds whose second homology groups are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. We apply the $s$-invariants to give a partial classification of simply connected total spaces of circle bundles over $\left(\mathbb{C}P^{1}\times\mathbb{C}P^{2}\right)\#\mathbb{C}P^{3}$ up to diffeomorphism. As an application, we show that there is a simply connected $7$-manifold whose space and moduli space of positive Ricci curvature metrics both have infinitely many path components. We also determine bordism groups $\Omega_{8}^{Spin}\left(K_{2}\right)$ and $\Omega_{8}^{Spin}\left(K_{2};\mathrm{pr}_{1}^{*}\gamma^{1}\right)$ that are required in the deduction of $s$-invariants.</description>

      <title>Homotopy rigidity of nearby Lagrangian cocores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact Lagrangian submanifold $L \subset X^{2n}$ in a Weinstein sector is called a nearby Lagrangian cocore if it avoids all Lagrangian cocores and is equal to a shifted Lagrangian cocore at infinity. Let $k$ be the dimension of the core of the subcritical part of $X$. For $n \geq 2k+2$ we prove that that the inclusion of $L$ followed by the retract to the Lagrangian core of $X$ and the quotient by the $(n-k-1)$-skeleton of the core, is null-homotopic. As a consequence, in many examples, a nearby Lagrangian cocore is smoothly isotopic (rel boundary) to a Lagrangian cocore in the complement of the missed Lagrangian cocores. The proof uses the spectral wrapped Donaldson-Fukaya category with coefficients in the ring spectrum representing the bordism group of higher connective covers of the orthogonal group.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphisms of surfaces that preserve continuously differentiable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Homeo$^1(S)$, the group of homeomorphisms of a surface that preserve the set of one-dimensional $C^1$ submanifolds of that surface. The group Homeo$^1(S)$ belongs to a family of similarly defined groups Homeo$^k(S)$ that were recently introduced by the author. In a separate paper, we have shown that for most closed surfaces, Homeo$^k(S)$ is naturally isomorphic to the automorphisms of a smooth fine curve graph. By contrast, the work in this paper gives local conditions that characterize Homeo$^1(S)$. We show that there exists a collection of conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for a homeomorphism of the surface to be an element of this group. These conditions primarily depend upon the structure of the induced map on the projective tangent bundle. Additionally, we provide examples of several types of elements of Homeo$^1(S)$ that are not diffeomorphisms. These include inducing discontinuous maps on the projective tangent bundle and having infinitely many non-differentiable points.</description>

      <title>On the Coarse Lusternik-Schnirelmann Category of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse analog of the classical Lusternik-Schnirelmann category which we denote by $\text{c-cat}$, defined for metric spaces in the coarse homotopy category. This provides a new tool for studying large-scale topological properties of groups and spaces. We establish that $\text{c-cat}$ is a coarse homotopy invariant and prove a lower-bound $\text{p-cat}(\Gamma)\leq \text{c-cat}(\Gamma)$ for geometrically finite groups $\Gamma$, where $\text{p-cat}$ denotes the proper LS-category introduced in 1992 by Ayala and co-authors. We also prove an upper bound $\text{c-cat}(\Gamma) \leq \text{asdim}(\Gamma)$ for bicombable 1-ended groups which are semistable at $\infty$.</description>

      <title>XC-tangles and universal invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of decorated abstract graphs, that we call XC-tangles, that provides a very convenient framework to study quantum invariants of tangles and virtual tangles. These can be viewed as a far-reaching generalisation of rotational tangle diagrams for (virtual) upwards tangles, and constitute the topological analogue of XC-algebras, the minimum algebraic structure needed to construct an knot isotopy invariant following the construction of Lawrence and Lee. XC-tangles admit a very natural description in terms of the so-called XC-Gauss diagrams, and this equivalence lifts the well-known equivalence between virtual upwards tangles and upwards Gauss diagrams. For every XC-algebra $A$, there is a naturally defined strict monoidal full functor $Z_A: \mathcal{T}^{\mathrm{XC}} \rightarrow v\mathcal{E}(A)$ from the category of XC-tangles to the "virtual category of elements of $A$". When $A$ is the endomorphism algebra of a finite-dimensional representation of a ribbon Hopf algebra, this functor can be viewed as an extension of the corresponding Reshetikhin-Turaev functor. Lastly, we also initiate the study of a theory of finite type invariants for one-component XC-tangles that lifts that for virtual long knots.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the proper homotopy equivalence relation for locally finite graphs is Borel complete. Furthermore, among the infinite graphs, there is a comeager equivalence class. As corollaries, we obtain the analogous results for the homeomorphism relation of noncompact surfaces with pants decompositions.</description>
