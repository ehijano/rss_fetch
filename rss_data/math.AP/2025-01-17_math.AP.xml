      <title>Second-Order $\Gamma$-Limit for the Cahn-Hilliard Functional with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of the asymptotic development of order 2 by $\Gamma$ -convergence of the Cahn-Hilliard functional with Dirichlet boundary conditions initiated in [8]. While in the first paper, the Dirichlet data are assumed to be well separated from one of the two wells, here this is no longer the case. In the case where there are no interfaces, it is shown that there is a transition layer near the boundary of the domain.</description>

      <title>Amplitude blowup in compressible Euler flows without shock formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated that continuous self-similar radial Euler flows can
  drive primary (non-differentiated) flow variables to infinity at the center of motion.
  Among the variables that blow up at collapse is the pressure, and it is unsurprising that
  this type of behavior can generate an outgoing shock wave.
  In this work we prove that there is an alternative scenario in which an incoming,
  continuous 3-d flow suffers blowup, including in pressure,
  and yet remains continuous beyond collapse. We verify that this behavior is possible
  even in cases where the fluid is everywhere moving toward the center of motion at time of collapse.
  The results underscore the subtlety of shock formation in multi-dimensional flow.</description>

      <title>On the minimal Blow-up rate for the 2D modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider the modified $L^2$ critical Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in $\mathbb R^2$, for initial conditions in the Sobolev space $H^s$ with $s&gt;3/4.$ Assuming that there is a blow up solution at finite time $T^{*}$, we obtain a lower bound for the blow up rate of that solution, expressed in terms of a lower bound for the $H^s$ norm of the solution. It is found a nontrivial gap between conjectured blow up rates and our results. The analysis is based on properly quantifying the linear estimates given by Faminskii, as well as, the local well-posedness theory of Linares and Pastor, combined with an argument developed by Weissler for study singular solutions of the semilinear heat equations and also used by Colliander-Czuback-Sulem in the context of the Zakharov system.</description>

      <title>Fluid-Structure Interaction with Porous Media: The Beaver-Joseph condition in the strong sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article considers fluid structure interaction describing the motion of a fluid contained in a porous medium. The fluid is modelled by Navier-Stokes equations and the coupling between fluid and the porous medium is described by the classical Beaver-Joseph or the Beaver-Joseph-Saffman interface condition. In contrast to previous work these conditions are investigated for the first time in the strong sense and it is shown that the coupled system admits a unique, global strong solution in critical spaces provided the data are small enough. Furthermore, a Serrin-type blow-up criterium is developed and higher regularity estimates at the interface are established, which say that the solution is even analytic provided the forces are so.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study quasi-linear hyperbolic systems. Our goal in this paper is to provide a new proof of local existence of a classical solution for the system. Most difficult point is to prove the convergence of the derivative of approximate solutions by the Arzela-Ascoli theorem.</description>

      <title>A multi-class non-local macroscopic model with time delay for mixed autonomous / human-driven traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a class of systems of non-local conservation laws in one space-dimension incorporating time delay, which can be used to investigate the interaction between autonomous and human-driven vehicles, each characterized by a different reaction time and interaction range. We construct approximate solutions using a Hilliges-Weidlich scheme and we provide uniform L $\infty$ and BV estimates which ensure the convergence of the scheme, thus obtaining existence of entropy weak solutions of bounded variation. Uniqueness follows from an L 1 stability result derived from the entropy condition. Additionally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate applications to mixed autonomous / human-driven traffic flow modeling. In particular, we show that the presence of autonomous vehicles improves overall traffic flow and stability.</description>

      <title>Higher Sobolev regularity on the mixed local and nonlocal p-Laplace equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic study of the interior Sobolev regularity of weak solutions to the mixed local and nonlocal $p$-Laplace equations. To be precise, we show that the weak solution $u$ belongs to $W^{2, p}_\mathrm{loc}$ and even $W^{2, 2}_{\rm loc}$ Sobolev spaces in the subquadratic case, while $|\nabla u|^{\frac{p-2}{2}}\nabla u$ is of the class $W^{1, 2}_\mathrm{loc}$ in the superquadratic scenario, both of which coincide with that of the classical $p$-Laplace equations. Moreover, an improved higher fractional differentiability and integrability result $u\in W^{1+\beta, q}_\mathrm{loc}$ is proved in the full range $p\in (1, \infty)$ for any $q\in [\max\{p, 2\}, \infty)$ and $\beta\in(0, \frac 2q)$. The main analytical tools are the finite difference quotient technique, suitable energy method and tail estimates. As far as we know, our results are new within the context of such mixed problems.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions for fast diffusion equation with a divergence type of drift term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates fast diffusion equations with a divergence type of drift term. We establish the existence of nonnegative $L^q$-weak solutions which satisfies energy estimates or even further with speed estimates in Wasserstein spaces under assuming certain classes for the drift that are differ from those in porous medium equations. When the drift has divergence-free structure, we construct weak solutions under weaker conditions on the drift. Moreover, the same techniques partially extend to porous medium equations. As an application, we also discuss a viscous Boussinesq system of fast diffusion type.</description>

      <title>Towards Spectral Convergence of Locally Linear Embedding on Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a differential operator that governs the asymptotic behavior of the unsupervised learning algorithm known as Locally Linear Embedding when a large data set is sampled from an interval or disc. In particular, the differential operator is of second order, mixed-type, and degenerates near the boundary. We show that a natural regularity condition on the eigenfunctions imposes a consistent boundary condition and use the Frobenius method to estimate pointwise behavior. We then determine the limiting sequence of eigenvalues analytically and compare them to numerical predictions. Finally, we propose a variational framework for determining eigenvalues on other compact manifolds.</description>

      <title>Shock-type singularity of the hyperbolic-parabolic chemotaxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the hyperbolic-parabolic chemotaxis (HPC) model, which is a hydrodynamic model describing vascular network formation at the early stage of the vasculature. We study analytically the singularity formation associated with the shock-type structure, which was numerically observed by Filbet, Lauren{\c{c}}ot, and Perthame \cite{filbet2005derivation} and Filbet and Shu \cite{filbet2005approximation}. We construct the blow-up profile in a 1D HPC system on $\mathbb{R}$ as follows: The blow-up profile is stable in the sense of $H^m$ topology ($m\geq 5$) prior to the occurrence of the singularity. For the first singularity, while the density and velocity $(\rho, u)$ of endothelial cells themselves remain bounded, the gradients of the density and velocity blow up. The chemoattractant concentration $\phi$ has $C^2$ regularity. However, the density and velocity with $C^ {\frac{1}{3}}$ regularity exhibit a cusp singularity at a unique blow-up point, the location and time of which are explicitly estimated. Furthermore, the HPC system is $C^1$ differentiable except in any neighborhood of the blow-up point.</description>

      <title>Ill-Posedness of the Incompressible Euler--Maxwell Equations in the Yudovich Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown recently by Ars\'enio and the author that the two-dimensional incompressible Euler--Maxwell system is globally well-posed in the Yudovich class, provided that the electromagnetic field enjoys appropriate conditions, including the Normal Structure. In this paper, we prove that this assumption is sharp, in the sense that the Euler--Maxwell system becomes ill-posed in the Yudovich class for initial data that do not obey the Normal Structure condition. The proof applies to both the whole plane and the two-dimensional torus, and holds for any value of the speed of light $c\in (0,\infty)$. This is achieved by expanding the magnetic field around a horizontal background and showing that the Lorentz force can be decomposed into two parts: the first is in the form of a singular operator acting on the vorticity, and the second, a "remainder", is of lower order when analyzed in a specific time regime.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness analysis on the Navier-Stokes equation in $C_{t}L^{q}$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of any prescribed kinetic energy, we implement the intermittent convex integration scheme with $L^{q}$-normalized intermittent jets to give a direct proof for the existence of solution to the Navier-Stokes equation in $C_{t}L^{q}$ for some uniform $2&lt;q\ll3$ without the help of interpolation inequality. The result shows the sharp nonuniqueness that there evolve infinite nontrivial weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation starting from zero initial data. Furthermore, we improve the regularity of solution to be of $C_{t}W^{\alpha,q}$ in virtue of the fractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities with some $0&lt;\alpha\ll1$. More importantly, the proof framework provides a stepping stone for future progress on the method of intermittent convex integration due to the fact that $L^{q}$-normalized building blocks carry the threshold effect of the exponent $q$ arbitrarily close to the critical value $3$.</description>

      <title>Relatively non-degenerate integrated decay estimates for massless Vlasov fields on Schwarzschild spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we make use of a weight function capturing the concentration phenomenon of unstable future-trapped causal geodesics. A projection $V_+$, on the tangent space of the null-shell, of the associated symplectic gradient turns out to enjoy good commutation properties with the massless Vlasov operator. This reflects that $V_+f$ decays exponentially locally near the photon sphere, for any smooth solution $f$ to the massless Vlasov equation.
  By identifying a well-chosen modification of $V_+$, we are able to construct a $W_{x,p}^{1,1}$ weighted norm for which any smooth solution to the massless Vlasov equation verifies an integrated local energy decay estimate without relative degeneration. Together with the $r^p$-weighted energy method of Dafermos--Rodnianski, we establish time decay for the energy norm. This norm allows for the control of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathrm{T}[f]$ as well as all its first order derivatives.
  The method developed in this paper is in particular compatible with approaches recently developed for the study of quasi-linear wave equations on black hole spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Under a condition that breaks the volume doubling barrier, we obtain a time polynomial structure result on the space of ancient caloric functions with polynomial growth on manifolds.
  As a byproduct, it is shown that the finiteness result for the space of harmonic functions with polynomial growth on manifolds in \cite{CM97} and \cite{Li97} are essentially sharp, except for the multi-end cases, addressing an issue raised in \cite{CM98}.</description>

      <title>The Spatially Homogeneous Boltzmann Equation for Bose-Einstein Particles: Rate of Strong Convergence to Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.04038v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is a continuation of our previous work on the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for Bose-Einstein particles with quantum collision kernel that includes the hard sphere model. Solutions $F_t$ under consideration that conserve the mass, momentum, and energy and converge at least weakly to equilibrium $F_{{\rm be}}$ as $t\to\infty$ have been proven to exist at least for radially symmetric and non-singular initial data, and for the case of low temperature, $F_t$ have to be positive Borel measures. The new progress is as follows: we prove that the long time convergence of $F_t(\{0\})$ to the Bose-Einstein condensation $F_{{\rm be}}(\{0\})$ for low temperature holds for all radially symmetric and non-singular initial data $F_0$. This immediately implies the long time strong convergence to equilibrium. We also obtain an algebraic rate of the strong convergence for arbitrary temperature. Our proofs are based on the entropy control, Villani's inequality for the entropy dissipation, a suitable time-dependent convex combination between the solution and a fixed positive function (in order to overcome the lack of positive lower bound), the convex-positivity of the cubic collision integral, and an iteration technique for obtaining a positive lower bound of condensation.</description>

      <title>Normalized ground states for the NLS equation with combined nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.00826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study existence and properties of ground states for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with combined power nonlinearities \[ -\Delta u= \lambda u + \mu |u|^{q-2} u + |u|^{p-2} u \qquad \text{in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N \ge 1$,} \] having prescribed mass \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} |u|^2 = a^2. \] Under different assumptions on $q&lt;p$, $a&gt;0$ and $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ we prove several existence and stability/instability results. In particular, we consider cases when \[ 2&lt;q \le 2+ \frac{4}{N} \le p&lt;2^*, \quad q \neq p, \] i.e. the two nonlinearities have different character with respect to the $L^2$-critical exponent. These cases present substantial differences with respect to purely subcritical or supercritical situations, which were already studied in the literature.
  We also give new criteria for global existence and finite time blow-up in the associated dispersive equation.</description>

      <title>Normalized ground states for the NLS equation with combined nonlinearities: the Sobolev critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.02003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study existence and properties of ground states for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with combined power nonlinearities \[ -\Delta u= \lambda u + \mu |u|^{q-2} u + |u|^{2^*-2} u \qquad \text{in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N \ge 3$,} \] having prescribed mass \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} |u|^2 = a^2, \] in the \emph{Sobolev critical case}. For a $L^2$-subcritical, $L^2$-critical, of $L^2$-supercritical perturbation $\mu |u|^{q-2} u$ we prove several existence/non-existence and stability/instability results.
  This study can be considered as a counterpart of the Brezis-Nirenberg problem in the context of normalized solutions, and seems to be the first contribution regarding existence of normalized ground states for the Sobolev critical NLSE in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00500v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a proof of Local Decay Estimates for Schr\"odinger type equations, which is based on the knowledge of Asymptotic Completeness (AC). This approach extends to time dependent potential perturbations, as it does not rely on Resolvent Estimates or related methods. Global in time Strichartz estimates follow for quasi-periodic time-dependent potentials from our results.</description>

Abstract: We consider the long time evolution of a population of charged particles, under strong magnetic fields and collision mechanisms. We derive a fluid model and justify the asymptotic behavior toward smooth solutions of this regime. In three space dimensions, a constraint ocurs along the parallel direction. For eliminating the corresponding Lagrange multiplier, we average along the magnetic lines.</description>

      <title>Global Diffusive Expansion of Boltzmann Equation in exterior Domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of flows over an obstacle is one of the fundamental problems in fluids. In this paper we establish the global validity of the diffusive limit for the Boltzmann equations to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system in an exterior domain. To overcome the well-known difficulty of the lack of Poincare's inequality in unbounded domain, we develop a new $L^2-L^3-L^6$ splitting to extend $L^2-L^\infty$ framework into the unbounded domain.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of compactness and weighted eigenvalue problem associated with fractional Hardy-type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the following fractional {Hardy-type} inequality: \begin{align} \label{Fractional Hardy_abst}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} |w(x)||u(x)|^p \mathrm{d}x \leq C \int_{\mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^N} \frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{N+sp}} \mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y:= \|u\|_{s,p}^p\,, \ \forall u \in \mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N), \end{align} where $0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;p&lt;\frac{N}{s}$, and $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ is the completion of $C_c^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with respect to the {norm} $\|\cdot\|_{s,p}$. We denote the space of admissible {weight function} $w$ in \eqref{Fractional Hardy_abst} by $\mathcal{H}_{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Maz'ya-type characterization helps us to define a Banach function norm on $\mathcal{H}_{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Using the Banach function space structure and the concentration compactness type arguments, we provide several characterizations for the compactness of the map ${W}(u)= \int_{{\mathbb{R}^N}} |w| |u|^p \mathrm{d}x$ on $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$. In particular, we prove that ${W}$ is compact on $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ if and only if $w \in \mathcal{H}_{s,p,0}(\mathbb{R}^N):=\overline{C_c(\mathbb{R}^N)} \ \mbox{in} \ \mathcal{H}_{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Further, we study the following {weighted} eigenvalue problem: \begin{equation*}
  (-\Delta_{p})^{s}u = \lambda w(x) |u|^{p-2}u ~~\text{in}~\mathbb{R}^{N}, \end{equation*} where $(-\Delta_{p})^{s}$ is the fractional $p$-Laplace operator and $w = w_{1} - w_{2}~\text{with}~ w_{1},w_{2} \geq 0,$ is such that $ w_{1} \in \mathcal{H}_{s,p,0}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and $w_{2} \in L^{1}_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^N)$.</description>

      <title>Curvature and sharp growth rates of log-quasimodes on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain new optimal estimates for the $L^2(M)\to L^q(M)$, $q\in (2,q_c]$, $q_c=2(n+1)/(n-1)$, operator norms of spectral projection operators associated with spectral windows $[\lambda,\lambda+\delta(\lambda)]$, with $\delta(\lambda)=O((\log\lambda)^{-1})$ on compact Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\ge2$ all of whose sectional curvatures are nonpositive or negative. We show that these two different types of estimates are saturated on flat manifolds or manifolds all of whose sectional curvatures are negative. This allows us to classify compact space forms in terms of the size of $L^q$-norms of quasimodes for each Lebesgue exponent $q\in (2,q_c]$, even though it is impossible to distinguish between ones of negative or zero curvature sectional curvature for any $q&gt;q_c$.</description>

      <title>On location of maximal gradient of torsion function over some non-symmetric planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the location of the maximal gradient of the torsion function on some non-symmetric planar domains. First, by establishing uniform estimates for narrow domains, we prove that as a planar domain bounded by two graphs of functions becomes increasingly narrow, the location of the maximal gradient of its torsion function tends toward the endpoint of the longest vertical line segment, with smaller curvature among them. This shows that the Saint-Venant's conjecture on the location of fail points is valid for asymptotically narrow domains. Second, for triangles, we show that the maximal gradient of the torsion function always occurs on the longest sides, lying between the foot of the altitude and the midpoint of that side. Moreover, via nodal line analysis and the continuity method, we demonstrate that restricted on each side, the critical point of the gradient of the torsion function is unique and non-degenerate. Furthermore, by perturbation and barrier argument, we prove that for a class of nearly equilateral triangles, the critical point is closer to the midpoint than to the foot of the altitude, and the norm of the gradient of the torsion function has a larger value at the midpoint than at the foot of the altitude. Third, using the reflection method, we prove that for a non-concentric annulus, the maximal gradient of torsion always occurs at the point on the inner ring closest to the center of the outer ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stochastic Mean Field Games on networks with sticky transition conditions. In this setting, the diffusion process governing the agent's dynamics can spend finite time both in the interior of the edges and at the vertices. The corresponding generator is subject to limitations concerning second-order derivatives  and the invariant measure breaks down into a combination of an absolutely continuous measure within the edges and a sum of Dirac measures positioned at the vertices. Additionally, the value function, solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, satisfies generalized Kirchhoff conditions at the vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to demonstrate the announced result in [Loher, The Strong Harnack inequality for the Boltzmann equation, S\'eminaire Laurent Schwartz proceeding] by filling the gap in the proof sketch. We prove the semi-local Strong Harnack inequality for the Boltzmann equation for moderately soft potentials without cutoff assumption. The non-local operator in the Boltzmann equation is in non-divergence form, and thus the method developed in [arXiv:2404.05612] does not apply. However, we exploit that the Boltzmann equation is on average in divergence form, and we show that the non-divergent part of the collision operator is of lower order in a suitable sense, which proves to be sufficient to deduce the Strong Harnack inequality. Consequentially, we derive upper and lower bounds on the fundamental solution of the linearised Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering problems for non-linear wave equations on Lorentzian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that an inverse scattering problem for a semilinear wave equation can be solved on a manifold having an asymptotically Minkowskian infinity, that is, scattering functionals determine the topology, differentiable structure, and the conformal type of the manifold. Moreover, the metric and the coefficient of the non-linearity are determined up to a multiplicative transformation. The manifold on which the inverse problem is considered is allowed to be an open, globally hyperbolic manifold which may have non-trivial topology or several infinities (i.e., ends) of which at least one has to be of the asymptotically Minkowskian type. To formulate the inverse problems we define a new type of data, non-linear scattering functionals, which are defined also in the cases where the classically defined scattering operators are not well-defined. This makes it possible to solve inverse problems also in cases where some of the incoming waves lead to a blow-up of the scattered solution. We use non-linear interaction of waves as a beneficial tool that helps to solve the inverse problem. The corresponding inverse problem for the linear wave equation still remains unsolved.</description>

Abstract: We consider the boundedness and exponential integrability of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the degenerate elliptic equation % \[ -v^{-1}\mathrm{Div}(|\sqrt{Q}\nabla u|^{p-2}Q\nabla u)=f|f|^{p-2}, \quad 1&lt;p&lt;\infty, \] % assuming that there is a Sobolev inequality of the form % \[ \|\varphi\|_{L^N(v,\Omega)}\leq S_N\|\sqrt{Q} \varphi\|_{L^p(\Omega)}, \] % where $N$ is a power function of the form $N(t)=t^{\sigma p}$, $\sigma\geq 1$, or a Young function of the form $N(t)=t^p\log(e+t)^\sigma$, $\sigma&gt;1$. In our results we study the interplay between the Sobolev inequality and the regularity assumptions needed on $f$ to prove that the solution is bounded or is exponentially integrable. Our results generalize those previously proved in previous work by the authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a contact Hamiltonian $H(x,p,u)$ with certain dependence on the contact variable $u$. If $u_{-}$ is a viscosity solution of the contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation \[H(x,D_{x}u(x),u(x))=0,\quad x\in M,\] and $u_{-}$ is locally Lyapunov asymptotically stable, we will prove that the perturbed equation \[H(x,D_{x}u(x),u(x))+\varepsilon P(x,D_{x}u(x),u(x))=0,\quad x\in M,\] does exist viscosity solution $u_{-}^{\varepsilon}$ which converges uniformly to $u_{-}$, as perturbation parameter $\varepsilon$ converges to 0. Moreover, we give a case that in a neighborhood of viscosity solution $u_-$, the perturbed equation has an unique viscosity solution $u_{-}^{\varepsilon}$. Furthermore, $u_{-}^{\varepsilon}$ keeps locally Lyapunov asymptotically stability.</description>

Abstract: We study Riemannian metrics on 2-surfaces with integrable geodesic flows such that an additional first integral is high-degree polynomial in momenta. This problem reduces to searching for solutions to certain quasi-linear systems of PDEs which turn out to be semi-Hamiltonian. We construct plenty of local explicit and implicit integrable examples with polynomial first integrals of degrees 3, 4, 5. Our construction is essentially based on applying the generalized hodograph method.</description>
