      <title>Studies of the Fermi-Hubbard Model Using Quantum Computing</title>

Abstract: The use of quantum computers to calculate the ground state (lowest) energies of a spin lattice of electrons described by the Fermi-Hubbard model of great importance in condensed matter physics has been studied. The ability of quantum bits (qubits) to be in a superposition state allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations that are not possible with even the most powerful classical (digital) computers. This work has established a method for calculating the ground state energies of small lattices which should be scalable to larger lattices that cannot be calculated by classical computers. Half-filled lattices of sizes 1x4, 2x2, 2x4, and 3x4 were studied. The calculated energies for the 1x4 and 2x2 lattices without Coulomb repulsion between the electrons and for the 1x4 lattice with Coulomb repulsion agrees with the true energies to within 0.60%, while for the 2x2 lattice with Coulomb repulsion the agreement is within 1.50% For the 2x4 lattice, the true energy without Coulomb repulsion was found to agree within 0.18%.</description>

      <title>Symmetry constraints on topological invariants and irreducible band representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EBR is considered the building block in TQC and fundamental concept in SI methods. One of the hypophysis is that a fully occupied EBR has zero Berry-Wilczek-Zee phase and those occupied corresponds to trivial topology. Associated with it are the concepts of atomic limit and equivalence between BRs. In this manuscript, an explicit link between the BWZ phase of connected bands and that of its EBR or irreducible band representation (IBR) basis is established. When gapped system occurs under the TB model, the relation between the BWZ phase of a set of connected bands and its BR basis only persist if the later are IBRs. Thus the BWZ phase can be evaluated in terms of the IBRs. Equivalent segments of path integral of BWZ connection with respect to IBRs are established as representation of the space group and selection rule for corresponding BWZ phase established where possible. The occurrence of IBRs is rooted in real space symmetry but dependent on dynamic interaction and band topology. Three gapped systems in honeycomb lattices are discussed. Two spin-less cases are shown to be topologically trivial, whereas the selection rule cannot be developed for the spin-full pz orbital as in graphene. Two necessary conditions for topologically trivial phase are established, namely 1.Connected bands having the same closed set of IBR basis for all k and, 2.The reduced tensor element for the path integral of BWZ connection for such basis is symmetry forbidden due to contractable close loop having zero BWZ phase. Thus the IBRs are the building block of topologically trivial phase and symmetry constraint on BWZ phase are obtained through IBRs and selection rules via Wigner-Eckart theorem. Some examples demonstrate that the basic hypothesis of SI method is false. The analysis here advocate a paradigm shift from EBR to IBR as building block of topologically trivial phase.</description>
