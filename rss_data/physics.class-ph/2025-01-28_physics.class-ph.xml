      <title>Geodesics of charged particle in electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report calculations about the motion of a charged particle in an external electric and magnetic field. The metric for the particle moving on a slope with non-zero traction and coefficient of friction is also evaluated for weak fields. We have geometric solutions in terms of Finsler geometry. We show that our solution metrics belong to the ({\alpha}, \b{eta})-metric class for cases with and without motion on a slope. Further, the external magnetic field is manifested in an additional parameter in the metric. The geodesic spray coefficients under the influence of magnetic field have also been calculated. Finally, we have estimated the indicatrices and geodesics for slippery plane and cone.</description>

      <title>Single-shot capable surface acoustic wave dispersion measurement of a layered plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Established techniques for characterizing a layer on a substrate system via surface acoustic wave (SAW) dispersion measurement are often slow due to the need for scanning excitation or detection positions. We present a method for determining discrete points on the SAW mode at equidistant wavenumbers that requires only a single measurement, overcoming these speed limitations. A pulsed laser, shaped into an array of equidistant lines, generates elastic waves on the sample surface. A vibrometer detects the resulting surface displacement next to the line array. The periodic excitation arrangement results in constructive interference of the SAW at wavelengths corresponding to integer fractions of the line spacing. This leads to distinct peaks in the response spectrum, whose higher orders we term spatial harmonics of the SAW. The known line spacing determines the wavelengths, allowing the peak frequencies to be mapped to discrete points on the SAW dispersion curve, effectively sampling the SAW at specific equidistant wavenumbers. By solving an inverse problem, a model can be fit to the experimental data to obtain properties of the layered system. We demonstrate this technique on copper-clad epoxy laminate and roll-cladded aluminum alloy plates and compare our results with dispersion relation scans and micrography. Additionally, we analyze the method's sensitivity to elastic parameters and layer thickness. This approach offers a viable alternative to established SAW scanning methods, particularly in scenarios where the trade-off of lower wavenumber sampling density is acceptable to achieve exceptionally fast measurements while avoiding moving parts.</description>

      <title>A Generalised Coleman-Noll Procedure and the Balance Laws of Hyper-Anelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14543v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the balance laws of hyperelasticity (Green elasticity), i.e., conservation of mass and balance of linear and angular momenta, can be derived using the first law of thermodynamics by postulating its invariance under superposed rigid body motions of the Euclidean ambient space -- the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin theorem. In the case of a non-Euclidean ambient space, covariance of the energy balance -- its invariance under arbitrary diffeomorphisms of the ambient space -- gives all the balance laws and the Doyle-Ericksen formula -- the Marsden-Hughes theorem. It is also known that, by assuming the balance laws, and positing the first and second laws of thermodynamics, the Doyle-Ericksen formula can be derived\textemdash the Coleman-Noll procedure. In this paper, we propose a generelization of the Coleman-Noll procedure: we show that the Doyle-Ericksen formula as well as the balance laws for both hyperelasticity and hyper-anelasticity can be derived using the first and second laws of thermodynamics without assuming any (observer) invariance.</description>

      <title>Complex Poynting vector in gyromagnetic media and its impact on power flow in guided modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the relation between the time-varying spinning nature of the instantaneous Poynting vector and the phasor form of the complex Poynting vector in the bulk of the gyromagnetic medium. We show the presence of a transverse reactive power component in the bulk of the gyrotropic medium, even for plane wave propagation. We use a simple quantification technique of Poynting vector spin to analyze the rotation of the instantaneous Poynting vector using the complex phasor form of the time-averaged Poynting vector. For a transverse electric mode, we show the similarity between the Poynting vector spin and the photonic spin of the magnetic field. The Poynting vector spin is then used to represent the transverse power transfer across a ferrite-air interface supporting TE surface wave modes. Considering a gyromagnetic ferrite-filled rectangular waveguide following the TE mode profile, we show the correspondence between the Poynting vector spin and the overall positive and backward power flow. We analytically propose a mechanism to engineer the region of the waveguide supporting backward and forward power propagation.</description>
