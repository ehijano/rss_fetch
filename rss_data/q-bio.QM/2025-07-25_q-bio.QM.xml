      <title>Comparison of Optimised Geometric Deep Learning Architectures, over Varying Toxicological Assay Data Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric deep learning is an emerging technique in Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven cheminformatics, however the unique implications of different Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures are poorly explored, for this space. This study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7 different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint, to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations). Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other, compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN algorithm.</description>

      <title>CM-UNet: A Self-Supervised Learning-Based Model for Coronary Artery Segmentation in X-Ray Angiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries remains a significant challenge in clinical practice, hindering the ability to effectively diagnose and manage coronary artery disease. The lack of large, annotated datasets for model training exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools that could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer learning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with only 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice score, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This demonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance and reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to highlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for advancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation accuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve clinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease detection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.

      <title>Improving reproducibility of cheminformatics workflows with chembl-downloader</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern cheminformatics workflows derive datasets from ChEMBL, but few of these datasets are published with accompanying code for their generation. Consequently, their methodologies (e.g., selection, filtering, aggregation) are opaque, reproduction is difficult, and interpretation of results therefore lacks important context. Further, such static datasets quickly become out-of-date. For example, the current version of ChEMBL is v35 (as of December 2024), but ExCAPE-DB uses v20, Deep Confidence uses v23, the consensus dataset from Isigkeit _et al._ (2022) uses v28, and Papyrus uses v30. Therefore, there is a need for tools that provide reproducible bulk access to the latest (or a given) version of ChEMBL in order to enable researchers to make their derived datasets more transparent, updatable, and trustworthy. This article introduces `chembl-downloader`, a Python package for the reproducible acquisition, access, and manipulation of ChEMBL data through its FTP server. It can be downloaded under the MIT license from https://github.com/cthoyt/chembl-downloader and installed from PyPI with `pip install chembl-downloader.`</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting whether a molecule can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a key step in early-stage neuropharmaceutical development, directly influencing both research efficiency and success rates in drug discovery. Traditional empirical methods based on physicochemical properties are prone to systematic misjudgements due to their reliance on static rules. Early machine learning models, although data-driven, often suffer from limited capacity, poor generalization, and insufficient interpretability. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have become essential tools for predicting BBB permeability and guiding related drug design, owing to their ability to model molecular structures and capture complex biological mechanisms. This article systematically reviews the evolution of this field-from deep neural networks to graph-based structural modeling-highlighting the advantages of multi-task and multimodal learning strategies in identifying mechanism-relevant variables. We further explore the emerging potential of generative models and causal inference methods for integrating permeability prediction with mechanism-aware drug design. BBB modeling is in the transition from static classification toward mechanistic perception and structure-function modeling. This paradigm shift provides a methodological foundation and future roadmap for the integration of AI into neuropharmacological development.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Foundation Models for Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features. Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts.</description>

      <title>Oligonucleotide selective detection by levitated optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were functionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm wavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, SiNPs behave as harmonic oscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely detected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle types, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with respect to motion of the SiNPs which can be explained by a theoretical model. Data obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to the spectra. Linear discriminant analysis detected differences between the functionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs. Random forest modeling provided further evidence that the fitted data were different between the groups. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out, but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types</description>

      <title>A PBN-RL-XAI Framework for Discovering a "Hit-and-Run" Therapeutic Strategy in Melanoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10136v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Genomic Prediction using High-dimensional Secondary Phenotypes: the Genetic Latent Factor Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decreasing costs and new technologies have led to an increase in the amount of data available to plant breeding programs. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms routinely generate high-dimensional datasets of secondary features that may be used to improve genomic prediction accuracy. However, integration of these data comes with challenges such as multicollinearity, parameter estimation in $p &gt; n$ settings, and the computational complexity of many standard approaches. Several methods have emerged to analyze such data, but interpretation of model parameters often remains challenging. We propose genetic latent factor best linear unbiased prediction (glfBLUP), a prediction pipeline that reduces the dimensionality of the original secondary HTP data using generative factor analysis. In short, glfBLUP uses redundancy filtered and regularized genetic and residual correlation matrices to fit a maximum likelihood factor model and estimate genetic latent factor scores. These latent factors are subsequently used in multi-trait genomic prediction. Our approach performs better than alternatives in extensive simulations and a real-world application, while producing easily interpretable and biologically relevant parameters. We discuss several possible extensions and highlight glfBLUP as the basis for a flexible and modular multi-trait genomic prediction framework.</description>
