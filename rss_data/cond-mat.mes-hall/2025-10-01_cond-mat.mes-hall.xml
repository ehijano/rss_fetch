      <title>Topological non-Abelian Gauge Structures in Cayley-Schreier Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, novel crystalline constructions known as Cayley-Schreier lattices have been suggested as a platform for realizing arbitrary gauge fields in synthetic crystals with real hopping amplitudes. We show that Cayley-Schreier lattices can naturally give rise to implementable lattice systems that incorporate non-Abelian gauge structures transforming into a space-group symmetry. We show that the symmetry sectors can, moreover, be interpreted as blocks of spin models that can effectively realize a wealth of different topological invariants in a single setup. We underpin these general results with concrete models and show how they can be implemented in current experimental platforms. Our work sets the stage for a systematic investigation of topological insulators and metals with non-Abelian gauge structures.</description>

      <title>Chiral charge conservation and ballistic magnetotransport in a disordered Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in an ideal Weyl semimetal, in which the Fermi energy coincides with the band-touching nodes, weak direct inter-nodal scattering is irrelevant and, as a result, the chiral charge is (almost) exactly conserved. This leads to an experimentally-observable effect: in an applied magnetic field, the charge transport along the field becomes purely ballistic, with the conductance given by $e^2/h$ per magnetic flux quantum through the sample cross-section. This is the strongest experimental manifestation of nontrivial topology in Weyl and Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric origins of the orbital degrees of freedom of hybrid bosonic quasiparticles in magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital degree of freedom has recently attracted significant attention due to the novel phenomena it enables in condensed matter systems. However, the interpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles remains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of orbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons and phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in bosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion of the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the latter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional antiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum geometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking, yielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM. We propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage generated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the bosonic orbital degree of freedom. Our results establish a foundation for the emerging field of phonon orbitronics, providing both a conceptual bridge between phonon and magnon orbitronics and a tool for better understanding magnon-polarons. They also advance a unified framework for harnessing orbital degrees of freedom in bosonic systems and pave the way toward electrical control of magnetization and phononic transport.</description>

      <title>Electric-field control of pure spin photocurrent in germanene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical control of pure spin current remains a central challenge in spintronics, particularly in time-reversal symmetric systems composed of nonmagnetic elements, where spin and electric fields interact only indirectly. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for electrically tuning pure spin photocurrent in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry via a gate electric field. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that in systems with spin-orbit coupling and in-plane mirror symmetry, an out-of-plane electric field induces spin splitting and reversal in the band structure near the Fermi energy, enabling magnitude control and direction reversal of the pure spin photocurrent. To validate this mechanism, we perform first-principles calculations on germanene, an experimentally realized two-dimensional material. Beyond amplitude modulation, we reveal that reversing the direction of the applied electric field leads to a corresponding reversal of the pure spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we show that the pure spin photocurrent can be tuned by varying the photon energy and the incident angle of light, providing additional degrees of control over spin transport. These findings establish a robust strategy for electric-field-controlled pure spin transport in two-dimensional materials, offering new possibilities for the development of optospintronic devices.</description>

      <title>From Shapiro steps to photon-assisted tunneling in microwave-driven atomic-scale Josephson junctions with a single (magnetic) adatom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-small Josephson junctions are strongly influenced by noise and damping due to energy dissipation into the environment, which are expected to suppress phase coherence. Here, we investigate the coherence properties of atomic-scale Josephson junctions in a scanning tunneling microscope under microwave excitation. Plain Pb-Pb junctions exhibit hysteretic Shapiro steps as signature of a coherent resonant state. With increasing AC amplitude, phase coherence is reduced due to an increase of thermal fluctuations. In the presence of magnetic adatoms the Josephson coupling energy is reduced and quasi-particle tunneling is enhanced. With AC driving we observe a rapid suppression of coherence that we ascribe to photon-assisted quasi-particle tunneling through Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. Our results highlight the presence of phase coherence and shed light on the origin of the transition to incoherent transport, thereby revealing the importance of controlling dissipation in nanoscale superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Why is topology hard to learn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much attention has been devoted to the use of machine learning to approximate physical concepts. Yet, due to challenges in interpretability of machine learning techniques, the question of what physics machine learning models are able to learn remains open. Here we bridge the concept a physical quantity and its machine learning approximation in the context of the original application of neural networks in physics: topological phase classification. We construct a hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying the differences in trainability and representational power. Our work highlights the challenges in learning topological invariants and constitutes a stepping stone towards more accurate and better generalizable machine learning representations in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>N\'{e}el vector and Rashba SOC effects on RKKY interaction in 2D $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets possess two key features: non-relativistic alternating spin splitting (i.e., altermagnetism) and a material-dependent N\'{e}el vector. The former naturally coexists with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in real materials on substrates, prompting the question of how SOC affects the magnetic properties of altermagnets. The latter is crucial for information storage, making it essential to determine its orientation. To address these issues, we study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in two-dimensional (2D) $d$-wave altermagnets by independently varying the N\'{e}el vector orientation and the SOC strength. Our results demonstrate that the N\'{e}el vector orientation can be accurately determined via the Ising term without SOC, or qualitatively inferred via the DM terms with SOC. Moreover, we observe a novel Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) component distinct from previous reports, whose emergence is attributed to the synergy between altermagnetism and SOC. Additionally, through tuning SOC strength, we reveal the evolution of the RKKY spin models governed by five distinct mechanisms: the spin model may be determined solely by altermagnetism, solely by SOC, or solely by the kinetic term; alternatively, altermagnetism may coincidentally yield the same moderately anisotropic spin model as SOC, or compete with SOC to produce a spin model with maximal anisotropy. Beyond SOC strength, which mechanism operates also relies on the N\'{e}el vector orientation and impurity configurations. All results are numerically verified. These findings -- which were inaccessible in prior studies due to the limitations of first-order SOC expansion and fixed N\'{e}el vector orientation -- provide important new insights into the magnetic properties of altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Efficient heat-energy conversion from a non-thermal Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy harvesting is a technique that generates useful work from waste heat. Conventional energy harvesters acting on local thermal equilibrium states are constrained by thermodynamic limits, such as the Carnot efficiency. Quantum heat engines with non-thermal reservoirs are expected to exceed such limits. Here, we demonstrate energy harvesting from a nonthermal Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid in quantum Hall edge channels, where the non-thermal state is naturally formed due to the absence of thermalization. The scheme is tested with a quantum-dot energy harvester working on a non-thermal TL liquid supplied with waste heat from a quantum-point-contact transistor. Compared to the quasi-thermalized TL liquid, the non-thermal state prepared under the same heat is capable of a larger electromotive force and higher conversion efficiency. These characteristics can be understood by considering a binary Fermi distribution function of the non-thermal state induced by entropy-conserving equilibration. TL liquids are attractive non-thermal carriers for excellent energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Memristor-Driven Spike Encoding for Fully Implantable Cochlear Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurodynamic behavior of artificial neuron circuits made of Mott memristors provides versatile opportunities to utilize them for artificial sensing. Their small size and energy efficiency of generating spiking electrical signals enable usage in fully implantable cochlear implants. Here, we propose an auditory sensing unit realized by a piezo-MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) cantilever connected to a VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based oscillator circuit. This auditory sensing unit is capable of frequency-selective detection of vibrations and subsequent emission of a neural spiking waveform. The auditory sensing unit is tested under biologically realistic vibration amplitudes, and spike rate-encoding of the incoming stimulus is demonstrated, similarly to natural hearing processes. The tunability of the output spiking frequency and the shape of the spiking waveform are also demonstrated to provide suitable voltage spikes for the nervous system.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic domain walls under spin-orbit torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls in antiferromagnets under a spin-polarized current present rich dynamics that is not observed in ferromagnets, and it is tunable by the current polarization. Precessional dynamics is obtained for perpendicular spin polarization, in agreement with expectations in older works. Propagating walls are obtained for an in-plane polarization. We obtain the velocity as a function of current by a perturbation method for low velocities, and the wall profile is found to lack a definite parity. For high velocities, the main features of the wall profile are obtained by a direct solution of an equation that is valid in a limiting case. We discuss the magnetization of the dynamical walls and find that this can become large, providing a potential method for observations. Oscillatory motion of domain walls is obtained for spin polarization that has both perpendicular and in-plane components, and an analytical description is given.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency Pt75Au25-based spintronic terahertz emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) generate broadband THz radiation via ultrafast spin-charge conversion in magnetic multilayers, offering spectral coverage beyond that of photoconductive antennas and nonlinear optical crystals. Here, we demonstrate a new type of STE based on PtxAu100-x alloy that achieves signifi- cantly higher THz output power than widely used Pt-based devices. Alloy composition and layer thickness tuning yield Pt75Au25 as the optimal alloy providing a 30 % increase in THz power in CoFeB/Pt75Au25 bilayer STEs compared to the optimized CoFeB/Pt reference STE. In W/CoFeB/Pt75Au25 trilayer STEs, we observe a 10 % higher THz power than in the optimized W/CoFeB/Pt trilayer. The STE efficiency is reduced upon annealing for both Pt75Au25- and Pt-based STEs due to formation of interfacial alloys. Our results establish Pt75Au25 as a promising platform for high-performance STEs, where its giant spin Hall effect significantly enhances efficiency over conventional Pt-based devices.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Electrons Shattering: Current Noise Composition Laws for Electron Fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of the non-equilibrium current response for metallic systems near quantum critical points where electronic quasiparticles fractionalize, such as systems near continuous metal-insulator transitions or composite Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid transitions. Applying a generalized response theory within a Keldysh path integral framework, we derive a non-perturbative current noise composition law, wherein the total noise is the sum of the noise of each fractionalized constituent (bosonic holons and fermionic spinons), weighted by their respective resistivities. We demonstrate that the formally derived composition relations can be interpreted in terms of a simple analogy with resistors in series. We leverage this composition rule near certain quantum critical points to show that the shot noise can be suppressed in long nanowires as compared to Fermi liquid expectations due to the collusion of quantum criticality with fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Static magnetic control of light emission in plasmonic nanojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in metal nanoparticles have been studied extensively through scattering and absorption. Static magnetic field-induced changes in plasmonic far-field response stem from the classical Hall effect and are generally very small in noble metals within the visible frequency range at readily accessible magnetic fields. Planar plasmonic tunnel junctions allow the study of nanogap LSPRs through current-driven light emission. We find that the electroluminescence of such junctions is modulated by tens of percent with a magnetic field of a few Teslas, exceeding Hall-based expectations by orders of magnitude. Complementary quantum mechanical and electromagnetic modeling reveals that a modest static magnetic field can introduce significant chirality in the transition dipoles generated during the electron tunneling process. This strongly affects the excitation of LSPRs and leads to magnetic-field sensitive far-field electroluminescent emission. This is a new paradigm for tunable nanoscale light sources.</description>

      <title>Charge Transfer States in Donor Acceptor Bulk Heterojunctions as Triplet Triplet Annihilation Sensitizer for Solid-State Photon Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon interconversion in semiconductors is of fundamental importance for digital imaging and quantum sensing. Nonlinear processes such as triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) offer photon upconversion (UC) at yields desired for solid-state optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a multilayer molecular system where a near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizer facilitates robust photon UC. A molecular stack of squaraine DIB-SQ: 6,6-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is optimized for UC by fine tuning the PCBM loading to engineer charge transfer states that facilitate further triplet generation. This composite NIR photosensitizer layer, at a 1:3 blend ratio in heterojunction with rubrene, drives triplet population density to levels desired for effective TTA. When paired with a fully optimized annihilator layer of tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) doped rubrene, the NIR sensitizer produces a photon upconversion quantum yield of 1.36% at 690 nm, with a significantly low excitation intensity threshold for the onset of the linear regime.. Time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption spectroscopy, and magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal a detailed balance of photoexcited states and formation of charge transfer states of triplet character (3CT), which work in tandem with molecular states to sensitize the triplet state (T1) of rubrene. This approach of harnessing near-infrared photons presents promising avenue for advancing solid-state photon interconversion.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Raman Probing of Molecular Transport in sub-2-nm Plasmonic Quasi-2D Nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing molecular dynamics in nanoconfined channels with high spatiotemporal resolution is a key challenge in nanoscience, crucial for advancing catalysis, energy conversion, and molecular sensing. Bottom-up ultrathin plasmonic nanogaps, such as nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) structures, are ideal for ultrasensitive probing due to their extreme light confinement, but their perceived sealed geometry has cast doubt on the existence of accessible transport pathways. Here, counterintuitively, we demonstrate that ubiquitous ligand-capped NPoM-type nanogaps can form a natural quasi-two-dimensional nanochannel, supporting molecular transport over unprecedented length scales ($\gtrsim5$ $\mu$m) with an extreme aspect ratio ($&gt;10^3$). Using wavelength-multiplexed Raman spectroscopy, we resolve the underlying centripetal infiltration pathway with a spatial resolving power of $\sim$20 nm. This redefines the NPoM architecture as a sensitive, \textit{in-situ}, all-in-one "transport-and-probe" platform, enabling real-time, reusable monitoring of analyte with $\sim$10$^{-11}$ M. This work establishes a versatile new platform for advancing super-resolved \textit{in-situ} molecular sensing, nanoscale physicochemical studies, and on-chip nanophotofluidics.</description>

      <title>LLM Agents for Knowledge Discovery in Atomic Layer Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.</description>

      <title>Enabling full localization of qubits and gates with a multi-mode coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunable couplers are a key building block of superconducting quantum processors, enabling high on-off ratios for two-qubit entangling interactions. While crosstalk can be mitigated in idle mode, conventional single-mode couplers lack independent control over interactions in the one- and two-excitation manifolds, leading to unitary errors such as leakage during gate operations. Moreover, even at the nominal decoupled point, residual wavefunction delocalization persists, causing unintended qubit-qubit coupling. Here we propose a multi-mode tunable coupler that enables nonlinear control of interactions across excitation manifolds, achieving a high on-off ratio in the one-excitation manifold while suppressing coupling in the two-excitation manifold. The proposed design also realizes complete localization between qubits, providing perfect isolation at the decoupled point and opening new possibilities for scalable, high-fidelity quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction of Photons for Quantum Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, is vital for the realization of, e.g., quantum networks, distributed quantum computing, and quantum repeaters. The microwave-to-optical quantum transduction is of particular interest in the field of superconducting quantum computing, since interconnecting dilution refrigerators is considered inevitable for realizing large-scale quantum computers with fault-tolerance. In this review, we overview recent theoretical and experimental studies on the quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons. We describe a generic theory for the quantum transduction employing the input-output formalism, from which the essential quantities characterizing the transduction, i.e., the expressions for the transduction efficiency, the added noise, and the transduction bandwidth are derived. We review the major transduction methods that have been experimentally demonstrated, focusing the transduction via the optomechanical effect, the electro-optic effect, the magneto-optic effect, and the atomic ensembles. We also briefly review the recent experimental progress on the quantum transduction from superconducting qubit to optical photon, which is an important step toward the quantum state transfer between distant superconducting qubits interconnected over optical fibers.</description>

      <title>Structural and Compositional Complexities of Hierarchical Self-Assembly: a Hypergraph Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable self-assembly enables the construction of complex molecular, supramolecular, and crystalline architectures from well-designed building blocks. Here we introduce a hypergraph-based framework, termed Blocks \&amp; Bonds (B\&amp;B), that extends classical chemical graph theory to encode directed multi-colored interactions, internal symmetries of building blocs, and hierarchical organization. Within this framework, we develop a universal script, Structure Code, for encoding complex hypergraph organization. In the spirit of Kolmogorov's approach, we define Structural Complexity as the minimal information required to encode a self-assembled structure. It is complemented by Compositional Complexity, capturing the diversity of building blocks. The two measures are related through Complexity Inequality, stating that structural complexity cannot exceed compositional complexity for programmable assembly, and identify cases where violations signal emergent complexity. Applications to molecular systems (ethylene glycol, glucose) and programmable DNA-origami lattices demonstrate how B\&amp;B hypergraphs and the structure code naturally capture modularity, stereochemistry, and crystallographic order while enabling significant compression of structural information. This approach provides a unified and scalable language for classifying complexity across scales, bridging information theory with the design of programmable matter.</description>

      <title>Deterministic single-photon source over the terahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic single-photon source in the terahertz (THz) regime, triggered by a sequence of coherent optical pulses. The scheme leverages the permanent dipole moment of a single-polar quantum emitter to induce THz transitions between optically dressed states, enhanced by a resonant coupling to a hybrid THz cavity. We present a cavity design that delivers high efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability while also enabling easy tunability of the emission frequency across the THz range. A key challenge in this new class of dressed-state sources is that, unlike standard solid-state single-photon sources, the dressed nature of the transitions can lead to undesired optical repumping during emission due to spontaneous photon emission in the visible range, which reduces the purity of the THz single-photon state. We show that this issue can be mitigated through optimized pulse areas and a sufficiently high Purcell rate, criteria that are met by our proposed cavity design. Finally, we demonstrate the significant purity enhancement of postselected THz photons by means of optical heralding, illustrating the new opportunities unlocked by the unique integration of terahertz and visible technologies with dressed polar quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Nernst Effect from Berry Curvature in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nernst effect in superconductors is typically linked to fluctuating Cooper pairs above $T_c$ or vortex motion below $T_c$. We show instead that Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles can generate an intrinsic Nernst response in a clean, vortex-free superconducting state. Focusing on two-dimensional (2D) systems with Ising spin-orbit coupling, relevant to transition-metal dichalcogenides, we identify two regimes: an intervalley $s$-wave paired state where a weak magnetic field activates the effect, and an intravalley chiral $p$-wave paired state that exhibits a spontaneous charge or spin Nernst response without a field. We propose an experimental setup that circumvents screening and provide estimates of the signal magnitude. Our results establish the Nernst effect as a direct probe of Berry curvature and pairing symmetry in 2D spin-orbit-coupled superconductors.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced diffusion transport in flat-band systems with quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our previous understanding of transport in disordered system depends on the assumption that there is a well-defined Fermi velocity. The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in the system such as the diffusion length and localization length. However, nearly flat band materials with vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain how to understand the disorder effects and what quantities determine the characteristic length scales in the system. In the clean limit, it is expected that the bulk transport is absent. In this work, we demonstrate, with a diamond lattice, that disorder can induce diffusion transport in a flat-band system with finite quantum metric. As disorder increases, the bulk transmission channels are activated, and the conductance reaches a maximum before decays inversely with disorder strength. Importantly, via the calculation of the wave-packet dynamics numerically, we show that the quantum metric determines the diffusion length of the system. Analytically, we show that the interplay between the disorder and quantum geometry gives rise to an effective Fermi velocity, as captured by the self-consistent Born approximation. The diffusion coefficient is identified from the Bethe-Salpeter equation under the ladder approximation. Our results reveal a disorder-driven delocalization mechanism in flat-band systems with finite quantum metric which cannot be understood by well-established theories of quantum diffusion. Our theory is important for understanding the disorder effects and transport properties of flat band materials such as twisted bilayer graphene which are current under intense investigation.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the Levitov-Lesovik formula for the probability distribution function of the electron charge transferred through a phase coherent conductor, to include projective measurements that monitor the chiral propagation in quantum Hall edge modes. When applied to an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the monitoring reduces the visibility of the Aharonov-Bohm conductance oscillations while preserving the binomial form of the counting statistics, thereby removing a fundamental shortcoming of the dephasing-probe model of decoherence.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e excitons and exciton-polaritons: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moir\'e excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moir\'e excitons hybridize with photons to form moir\'e exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features.
  In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moir\'e excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moir\'e patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moir\'e polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moir\'e excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.</description>

      <title>Multiple Topological Phases Controlled via Strain in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22474v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are an emergent class of magnetic materials that combine properties of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, exhibiting spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and zero net magnetic moment due to combined time-reversal and crystal symmetry. Here, we construct a Kondo-lattice model on a two-dimensional square Lieb lattice to investigate the topological properties of AMs. We identify a type-II quantum spin Hall state characterized by spin-polarized counterpropagating edge states. Breaking the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, which connects magnetic sublattices, induces a transition to a quantum anomalous Hall state. We further establish a strain-induced mechanism to control these topological phase transitions and present the corresponding phase diagram. Finally, we demonstrate the predicted transitions in monolayer CrO, a realistic altermagnetic candidate, using first-principles calculations. Our findings highlight the potential of 2D AMs as a versatile platform for topological spintronics, enabling strain-tunable helical and chiral edge states within a single system.</description>

Abstract: The Lifshitz formula is well known as a theoretical approach to investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature. In this Letter, we generalize the Lifshitz formula to the Casimir effect originating from quantum fields at finite chemical potential. To demonstrate the versatility of this formula, we discuss the typical phenomena of the Casimir effect at finite chemical potential in various systems, such as some boundary conditions, finite temperatures, arbitrary spatial dimensions, and mismatched chemical potentials. This formula can be applied to the Casimir effect in dense quark matter and Dirac/Weyl semimetals, where the chemical potential is regarded as a parameter to control the Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Origin and stability of generalized Wigner crystallinity in triangular moir\'e systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Wigner crystals (GWC) on triangular moir\'e superlattices, formed from stacking two layers of transition metal chalcogenides, have been observed at multiple fractional fillings [Nature 587, 214 - 218 (2020), Nat. Phys. 17, 715 - 719 (2021), Nature 597, 650 - 654 (2021)]. Motivated by these experiments, tied with the need for accurate microscopic descriptions of these materials, we explore the origins of GWC at $n=1/3$ and $2/3$ filling. We demonstrate the general limitations of theoretical descriptions relying on finite-range, versus long-range interactions, however, we clarify why some properties are captured by an effective nearest-neighbor model. We study both classical and quantum effects at zero and finite temperatures, discussing the role of charge frustration, identifying a ``pinball" phase, a partially quantum melted GWC, with no classical analog. Our work addresses several experimental observations and makes predictions for how many of the theoretical findings can be potentially realized in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Ratchet Hall Effect in Fluctuating Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting ratchet-induced Hall effect (RHE), characterized by the emergence of a unidirectional, rectified flux of fluctuating Cooper pairs in a two-dimensional thin film exposed to an external electromagnetic field. The RHE is a second-order response with respect to the electromagnetic field amplitude. It consists of a nonzero photocurrent due to the breaking of the system's inversion symmetry driven by the combined action of the in-plane time-dependent electric field and a spatial modulation of the critical temperature. We explore a means to control the electric current by the polarization of the external field accompanied by a non-linear Hall effect of fluctuating Cooper pairs caused by circularly polarized irradiation. Moreover, the nonlinear conductivity tensor exhibits a higher-power dependence on the reduced temperature compared to that of the conventional Aslamazov-Larkin correction (or other fluctuating second-order nonlinear responses). It results in a dramatic enhancement of the non-linear Hall response of fluctuating Cooper pairs in the vicinity of the superconducting criticality.</description>

Abstract: We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is composed of two parts. One is universal, meaning that it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term. This form constitutes the relevant part of the dissipator only as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. Then, by considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we derive the other, drive-dependent, term completing the full dissipator. This part of the dissipator, originating from the third cumulant, is usually neglected when modeling the decoherent dynamics of controlled qubits. However, this further term constitutes the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative quantum systems. Also, it notably shows that the structure of our quantum master equation goes beyond the Lindblad form. The Lindblad form is recovered for memory-less baths. Finally, we demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudo-modes for quantum environments.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Control of Interlayer Excitons in 3R-MoS$_{2}$ / MoSe$_{2}$ Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: We investigate the interaction between interlayer excitons and ferroelectric domains in hBN-encapsulated 3R-MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructures, combining photoluminescence experiments with density functional theory and many-body Green's function calculations. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals a strong redshift of the interlayer exciton energy with increasing MoS$_2$ layer thickness, attributed to band renormalization and dielectric effects. We observe local variations in exciton energy that correlate with local ferroelectric domain polarization of the 3R-MoS$_2$ layer, showcasing distinct domain-dependent interlayer exciton transition energies. Gate voltage experiments demonstrate that the interlayer exciton energy can be tuned by electrically induced domain switching. These results highlight the potential for interlayer exciton control by local ferroelectric order and establish a foundation for future ferroelectric optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</description>
