      <title>Deep-Learning Approach for Tissue Classification using Acoustic Waves during Ablation with an Er:YAG Laser (Updated)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's mechanical tools for bone cutting (osteotomy) cause mechanical trauma that prolongs the healing process. Medical device manufacturers aim to minimize this trauma, with minimally invasive surgery using laser cutting as one innovation. This method ablates tissue using laser light instead of mechanical tools, reducing post-surgery healing time. A reliable feedback system is crucial during laser surgery to prevent damage to surrounding tissues. We propose a tissue classification method analyzing acoustic waves generated during laser ablation, demonstrating its applicability in an ex-vivo experiment. The ablation process with a microsecond pulsed Er:YAG laser produces acoustic waves, acquired with an air-coupled transducer. These waves were used to classify five porcine tissue types: hard bone, soft bone, muscle, fat, and skin. For automated tissue classification, we compared five Neural Network (NN) approaches: a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with time-dependent input, a Fully-connected Neural Network (FcNN) with either the frequency spectrum or principal components of the frequency spectrum as input, and a combination of a CNN and an FcNN with time-dependent data and its frequency spectrum as input. Consecutive acoustic waves were used to improve classification accuracy. Grad-Cam identified the activation map of the frequencies, showing low frequencies as the most important for this task. Our results indicated that combining time-dependent data with its frequency spectrum achieved the highest classification accuracy (65.5%-75.5%). We also found that using the frequency spectrum alone was sufficient, with no additional benefit from applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA).</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks in Histopathology: Emerging Trends and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Histopathological analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has seen a surge in the utilization of deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs often fall short in capturing the intricate spatial dependencies inherent in WSIs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a promising alternative, adept at directly modeling pairwise interactions and effectively discerning the topological tissue and cellular structures within WSIs. Recognizing the pressing need for deep learning techniques that harness the topological structure of WSIs, the application of GNNs in histopathology has experienced rapid growth. In this comprehensive review, we survey GNNs in histopathology, discuss their applications, and explore emerging trends that pave the way for future advancements in the field. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of GNNs and their potential applications in histopathology. Leveraging quantitative literature analysis, we identify four emerging trends: Hierarchical GNNs, Adaptive Graph Structure Learning, Multimodal GNNs, and Higher-order GNNs. Through an in-depth exploration of these trends, we offer insights into the evolving landscape of GNNs in histopathological analysis. Based on our findings, we propose future directions to propel the field forward. Our analysis serves to guide researchers and practitioners towards innovative approaches and methodologies, fostering advancements in histopathological analysis through the lens of graph neural networks.</description>
