      <title>Towards Underwater Detection of Diluted Bitumen with Interdigital Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diluted bitumen spills in freshwater environments pose significant challenges for detection and remediation due to the complex behaviour of the material once released, rendering traditional oil monitoring techniques, such as aerial surveys and fluorometry, ineffective. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing interdigital capacitive sensors to detect dilbit in water via frequency-dependent impedance measurements. Three sensor designs were fabricated and tested with a vector network analyzer across samples with varying dilbit concentrations. All capacitor designs were able to detect electrical changes in water and exhibited different linear regions, suggesting a strong potential for quantitative sensing. These findings support the integration of the sensors into autonomous underwater robotic platforms for real-time, distributed monitoring of dilbit spills in freshwater systems.</description>

      <title>Novel Simplified Model for Planar Capacitors up to 1 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study and modelling of planar capacitors remain highly relevant due to their broad applications. However, their accurate modelling presents significant challenges due to intrinsic high-frequency effects, which include not only parasitic inductance but also ohmic losses in the copper and dielectric losses in the substrate. Therefore, this work proposes developing a new simplified planar capacitor model consisting of two identical rectangular plates, which incorporates the effects of both the substrate and the medium between the conductor traces on the total capacitance. Moreover, it includes the impact of parasitic inductance and losses associated with the copper and substrate. This study demonstrated the importance of modelling both the dielectric substrate and the inter-conductor medium, with results showing significant improvements in the proposed model's accuracy. Experimental validation through comparison with an already established model in the literature and physical planar capacitors revealed good agreement for most cases studied.</description>

      <title>Upscaling the hyperpolarization sample volume of an automated hydrogenative parahydrogen-induced polarizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03790v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suffer from inherently low sensitivity due to the weak thermal polarization of nuclear spins. Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) offers a powerful route to enhance NMR signals by several orders of magnitude, enabling real-time metabolic imaging. However, PHIP implementations are often constrained by small sample volumes, limited automation, and complex high-pressure requirements. In this work, we present an upgraded, automated PHIP system capable of hyperpolarizing sample volumes of up to 2.2 mL, making it suitable for preclinical MRI applications. We developed several high-pressure reactors and multi-port NMR tube caps compatible with standard commercial 5, 10, and 16 mm glass tubes. Reactor designs were simulated and fabricated from chemically resistant polymers, ensuring mechanical safety at more than 30 bar. Using FLASH MRI, nutation, and CPMG sequences, we characterized magnetic field homogeneity and stability, establishing optimal sample dimensions (12.5/16 mm ID/OD glass tube, 20 mm height) with B0 inhomogeneity below 2.5 ppm and B1 inhomogeneity around 1%. A high level of injection reproducibility was confirmed (volume precision ~0.6%). Optimization of experimental parameters, including hydrogenation pressure, pH2 flow rate, and sample temperature, enabled rapid and efficient polarization transfer. At optimized conditions (20 bar pH2, 2 L/min flow, 55{\deg}C, 4 s bubbling time), up to 31.3% 1H polarization of two protons was achieved for deuterated ethyl acetate in acetone with the theoretical maximum of 50%. This level of polarization was achieved with a duty cycle of 80 s, and the standard deviation of the mean was below 6.8%.</description>

      <title>Background in Low Earth Orbiting Cherenkov Detectors, and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cherenkov detectors have been used in space missions for many decades, and for a variety of purposes, including for example, for Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) and Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) measurements. Cherenkov detectors are sensitive to many types of particles that are present in the environment of space, including gamma rays, trapped particles and cosmic particles, and each particle component acts as essentially a background when trying to view another specific particle component. In this research, GRAS/Geant4 simulations were performed to characterise the count rates that a simple Cherenkov detector design would experience in a low Earth orbit, and we find that Cherenkov count rates due to most particle components vary significantly depending on many different factors, including the location in the orbit, the date of the orbit, whether or not the detector is within the van Allen belts, and whether or not a solar particle event is occurring. We find that a small Cherenkov detector is readily able to gather detailed data on both trapped particles and spectral information during Ground-Level Enhancements. We also investigate the use of coincidence as a method to remove count rates due to trapped particles and delta electrons, finding that this method is generally very effective for resolving count rates due to GLEs amongst intense trapped particle environments, but that some Cherenkov count rates due to trapped particles are still observed in the simulated south Atlantic anomaly region.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic energy calibration of the SoLid detector with horizontal muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05180v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SoLid is a neutrino experiment at very-short baseline searching for active-to-sterile oscillations of reactor antineutrinos. The detection principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators: polyvinyl toluene and $^6$Li:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup allows the detector to be highly segmented; the basic detection unit is a 5 cm cube. High segmentation provides numerous advantages including precise localisation of the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of an antineutrino energy estimator based on the isolated positron energy, and a powerful background reduction tool that relies on the topological signature of the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of WLS fibres coupled to photosensors. A relative electromagnetic calibration is performed with horizontal cosmic muons. This source poses the simplest calibration problem in which a single detection unit is involved. In addition, large muon energy deposits allow us to perform a calibration at the most detailed level (i.e. per fibre) and to accurately define the fraction of energy escaping to neighbouring detection cells. A statistical precision at the sub-percent level is reached. The paper also discusses two methods to calibrate the absolute energy scale. The first method relies on horizontal muons, though the precision is limited to around 10\% because of the uncertainty in the energy distribution of such muons. A novel, alternative method based on the radioactive AmBe source is proposed. It takes advantage of the electron-positron pair-production process and provides a calibration point at 3.4 MeV (i.e. in the core of the IBD positron spectrum). The paper is concluded with various cross-check including a determination of the energy spectrum of the standard cosmogenic background candle: $^{12}$B.</description>

      <title>Observation and research on cosmic ray muons and solar modulation effect based on plastic scintillator detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays, originating from stars, supernovae, and other astrophysical sources, are composed of high-energy particles that enter Earths atmosphere. Upon interaction with atmospheric nuclei, these primary cosmic rays generate secondary particles, including neutrons, electrons, and muons, with muons constituting a dominant component at ground level. Muons, due to their relative abundance, stability, and well-characterized energy loss mechanisms, serve as critical probes for investigating the fundamental properties of cosmic rays. Studies of muon energy distribution, diurnal anisotropy, and their modulation by solar activity provide critical insights into the mechanism of particle acceleration in cosmic ray sources and the effects of solar and atmospheric.This study aims to characterize the counting spectra and anisotropic properties of cosmic ray muons by using a plastic scintillator detector system. The experiment was conducted over a three-month period, from December 2023 to February 2024, leveraging long-bar plastic scintillator detectors equipped with dual-end photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and a high-resolution digital data acquisition system. A dual-end coincidence measurement technique was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing thermal noise and other background interferences. Diurnal variations in muon count rates exhibit a pronounced pattern, with a systematic reduction occurring between 8:00 AM and 1:00 PM. This phenomenon is attributed to the solar shielding effects, where enhanced solar activity during daytime hours modulates the flux of galactic cosmic rays reaching Earths surface. The study further corroborates these findings through cross-comparisons with data from the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Observatory. These observations underscore the robustness of the plastic scintillator detector system for capturing detailed muon spectra and anisotropic patterns.</description>

      <title>Aperture limitation localization using beam position and beam loss monitor measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of beam injection in circular accelerators can be impacted by unknown aperture limitations in the vacuum chamber. These limitations can be detected by introducing localized distortions to the closed orbit of the circulating beam observed at beam position monitors (BPMs). The localized nature of introduced closed orbit distortions enables targeted identification of loss regions. In this paper, we present a method for localizing beam losses designed primarily for circular electron accelerators using a set of sequentially placed scintillator-based beam loss monitors (BLMs). By moving these monitors along the accelerator lattice, the proposed technique achieves sub-meter spatial resolution in beam loss localization. Relative calibration of the BLMs was performed using a strontium-90 radioactive source. We report experimental results from the implementation of this method at the VEPP-4M collider.</description>

      <title>Revealing Secondary Particle Signatures in PoCA-Based Muography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reinterprets so-called 'noise' in cosmic ray imaging, demonstrating that reconstructed Points of Closest Approach (PoCA points) at the detector locations contain valuable physical information that has been traditionally disregarded. Through comprehensive analysis of data from the detection system of four resistive plate chambers (RPCs) and Monte Carlo simulations employing energy deposition weighting for coordinate determination, we establish that these points physically originate from secondary particles produced by cosmic ray interactions with materials of both detectors and surrounding structures. The research yields two principal findings: first, the generation of secondary particles significantly affects the measurement accuracy of cosmic ray positions; second, the roof structure significantly impacts the distribution of PoCA points at detector positions, where quantitative analysis demonstrates a strong correlation between roof thickness and the number of reconstructed PoCA points -- a relationship that can be precisely measured through z-coordinate distribution analysis in specific intervals. These discoveries demonstrate that the same detection system can extract information from a new dimension, enabling acquisition of more comprehensive physical results. More importantly, it suggests the necessity to revise standard analysis approaches to fully exploit this additional information channel in cosmic ray tomography.</description>

      <title>Replacing detector simulation with heterogeneous GNNs in flavour physics analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the increasing volume of recorded data, the demand for simulation from experiments based at the Large Hadron Collider will rise sharply in the coming years. Addressing this demand solely with existing computationally intensive workflows is not feasible. This paper introduces a new fast simulation tool designed to address this demand at the LHCb experiment. This tool emulates the detector response to arbitrary multibody decay topologies at LHCb. Rather than memorising specific decay channels, the model learns generalisable patterns within the response, allowing it to interpolate to channels not present in the training data. Novel heterogeneous graph neural network architectures are employed that are designed to embed the physical characteristics of the task directly into the network structure. We demonstrate the performance of the tool across a range of decay topologies, showing the networks can correctly model the relationships between complex variables. The architectures and methods presented are generic and could readily be adapted to emulate workflows at other simulation-intensive particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Structural Light Absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of light with optical and mechanical systems is influenced by material properties, geometrical configurations, and surface topographies. Designing these systems necessitates a careful balance of conflicting requirements, such as minimising size and weight while simultaneously improving heat transfer and reducing stray light from illuminated peripheral mounting surfaces. Stray light is typically mitigated by apertures, coatings, and microscopic structures, alongside maintaining cleanliness. However, using apertures may not always be feasible, and effective optical absorber coatings or microscopic light absorbing structures can be costly and sensitive to environmental factors such as abrasion, radiation heating, or cleaning agents.
  In a proof-of-concept investigation, we design and analyse macroscopic structural light absorbers realised as periodic minimal surface approximations and quasi-stochastic lattices. The term "macroscopic" refers to minimal structural dimensions of approximately 100 micrometres. By increasing the number of reflections before residual reflected light reaches a hemispherical receiver, we achieve reductions in received peak intensities by factors of less than 0.39 and average intensities by factors of less than 0.65, without altering the surface properties.
  Macroscopic structural light absorbers support cost-effective and robust light-absorbing materials, such as black anodised aluminium or ABS polymers, while still achieving satisfactory stray light suppression. This approach is applicable to aerospace optical systems (such as telescopes and imaging spectrometers), as well as general scientific and industrial optical instruments and commercial products (including projectors and luminaires). The demonstrated structures can be sustainably fabricated through additive manufacturing processes like laser powder bed fusion.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Microscopy Experiments through Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing self driving laboratories (SDLs) for materials research, promising unprecedented acceleration of scientific discovery. However, current SDL implementations rely on rigid protocols that fail to capture the adaptability and intuition of expert scientists in dynamic experimental settings. We introduce Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant (AILA), a framework automating atomic force microscopy through LLM driven agents. Further, we develop AFMBench a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging AI agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state of the art models struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, Claude 3.5 sonnet performs unexpectedly poorly despite excelling in materials domain question answering (QA) benchmarks, revealing that domain specific QA proficiency does not necessarily translate to effective agentic capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLMs can deviate from instructions, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi agent frameworks outperform single-agent architectures. We also observe significant prompt fragility, where slight modifications in prompt structure cause substantial performance variations in capable models like GPT 4o. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection. Our findings underscore the necessity for rigorous benchmarking protocols and prompt engineering strategies before deploying AI laboratory assistants in scientific research environments.</description>
