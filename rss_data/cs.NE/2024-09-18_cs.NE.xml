      <title>PReLU: Yet Another Single-Layer Solution to the XOR Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that a single-layer neural network using Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) activation can solve the XOR problem, a simple fact that has been overlooked so far. We compare this solution to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the Growing Cosine Unit (GCU) activation function and explain why PReLU enables this capability. Our results show that the single-layer PReLU network can achieve 100\% success rate in a wider range of learning rates while using only three learnable parameters.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning in Memristor-based Neuromorphic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks, the third generation of artificial neural networks, have become an important family of neuron-based models that sidestep many of the key limitations facing modern-day backpropagation-trained deep networks, including their high energy inefficiency and long-criticized biological implausibility. In this work, we design and investigate a proof-of-concept instantiation of contrastive-signal-dependent plasticity (CSDP), a neuromorphic form of forward-forward-based, backpropagation-free learning. Our experimental simulations demonstrate that a hardware implementation of CSDP is capable of learning simple logic functions without the need to resort to complex gradient calculations.</description>

      <title>Bio-Inspired Mamba: Temporal Locality and Bioplausible Learning in Selective State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Bio-Inspired Mamba (BIM), a novel online learning framework for selective state space models that integrates biological learning principles with the Mamba architecture. BIM combines Real-Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)-like local learning rules, addressing the challenges of temporal locality and biological plausibility in training spiking neural networks. Our approach leverages the inherent connection between backpropagation through time and STDP, offering a computationally efficient alternative that maintains the ability to capture long-range dependencies. We evaluate BIM on language modeling, speech recognition, and biomedical signal analysis tasks, demonstrating competitive performance against traditional methods while adhering to biological learning principles. Results show improved energy efficiency and potential for neuromorphic hardware implementation. BIM not only advances the field of biologically plausible machine learning but also provides insights into the mechanisms of temporal information processing in biological neural networks.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers stand as the cornerstone of mordern deep learning. Traditionally, these models rely on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers to mix the information between channels. In this paper, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), a novel architecture that replaces MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers to enhance the expressiveness and performance of the model. Integrating KANs into transformers, however, is no easy feat, especially when scaled up. Specifically, we identify three key challenges: (C1) Base function. The standard B-spline function used in KANs is not optimized for parallel computing on modern hardware, resulting in slower inference speeds. (C2) Parameter and Computation Inefficiency. KAN requires a unique function for each input-output pair, making the computation extremely large. (C3) Weight initialization. The initialization of weights in KANs is particularly challenging due to their learnable activation functions, which are critical for achieving convergence in deep neural networks. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose three key solutions: (S1) Rational basis. We replace B-spline functions with rational functions to improve compatibility with modern GPUs. By implementing this in CUDA, we achieve faster computations. (S2) Group KAN. We share the activation weights through a group of neurons, to reduce the computational load without sacrificing performance. (S3) Variance-preserving initialization. We carefully initialize the activation weights to make sure that the activation variance is maintained across layers. With these designs, KAT scales effectively and readily outperforms traditional MLP-based transformers.</description>

      <title>Evolving a Multi-Population Evolutionary-QAOA on Distributed QPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our research combines an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to update the ansatz parameters, in place of traditional gradient-based methods, and benchmark on the Max-Cut problem. We demonstrate that our Evolutionary-QAOA (E-QAOA) pairing performs on par or better than a COBYLA-based QAOA in terms of solution accuracy and variance, for $d$-3 regular graphs between 4 and 26 nodes, using both $max\_count$ and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for fitness function evaluations. Furthermore, we take our algorithm one step further and present a novel approach by presenting a multi-population EA distributed on two QPUs, which evolves independent and isolated populations in parallel, classically communicating elite individuals. Experiments were conducted on both simulators and quantum hardware, and we investigated the relative performance accuracy and variance.</description>

      <title>MonoKAN: Certified Monotonic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have significantly advanced various fields by effectively recognizing patterns and solving complex problems. Despite these advancements, their interpretability remains a critical challenge, especially in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. To address this, explainable AI (XAI) has made progress in demystifying ANNs, yet interpretability alone is often insufficient. In certain applications, model predictions must align with expert-imposed requirements, sometimes exemplified by partial monotonicity constraints. While monotonic approaches are found in the literature for traditional Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they still face difficulties in achieving both interpretability and certified partial monotonicity. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture, based on learnable activation functions parametrized as splines, has been proposed as a more interpretable alternative to MLPs. Building on this, we introduce a novel ANN architecture called MonoKAN, which is based on the KAN architecture and achieves certified partial monotonicity while enhancing interpretability. To achieve this, we employ cubic Hermite splines, which guarantee monotonicity through a set of straightforward conditions. Additionally, by using positive weights in the linear combinations of these splines, we ensure that the network preserves the monotonic relationships between input and output. Our experiments demonstrate that MonoKAN not only enhances interpretability but also improves predictive performance across the majority of benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art monotonic MLP approaches.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised End-to-End Training with a Self-Defined Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing algorithms for versatile AI hardware that can learn on the edge using both labeled and unlabeled data is challenging. Deep end-to-end training methods incorporating phases of self-supervised and supervised learning are accurate and adaptable to input data but self-supervised learning requires even more computational and memory resources than supervised learning, too high for current embedded hardware. Conversely, unsupervised layer-by-layer training, such as Hebbian learning, is more compatible with existing hardware but does not integrate well with supervised learning. To address this, we propose a method enabling networks or hardware designed for end-to-end supervised learning to also perform high-performance unsupervised learning by adding two simple elements to the output layer: Winner-Take-All (WTA) selectivity and homeostasis regularization. These mechanisms introduce a "self-defined target" for unlabeled data, allowing purely unsupervised training for both fully-connected and convolutional layers using backpropagation or equilibrium propagation on datasets like MNIST (up to 99.2%), Fashion-MNIST (up to 90.3%), and SVHN (up to 81.5%). We extend this method to semi-supervised learning, adjusting targets based on data type, achieving 96.6% accuracy with only 600 labeled MNIST samples in a multi-layer perceptron. Our results show that this approach can effectively enable networks and hardware initially dedicated to supervised learning to also perform unsupervised learning, adapting to varying availability of labeled data.</description>
