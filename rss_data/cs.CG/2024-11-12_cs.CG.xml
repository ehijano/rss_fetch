      <title>Hyperplane Distance Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth measures quantify central tendency in the analysis of statistical and geometric data. Selecting a depth measure that is simple and efficiently computable is often important, e.g., when calculating depth for multiple query points or when applied to large sets of data. In this work, we introduce \emph{Hyperplane Distance Depth (HDD)}, which measures the centrality of a query point $q$ relative to a given set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, defined as the sum of the distances from $q$ to all $\binom{n}{d}$ hyperplanes determined by points in $P$. We present algorithms for calculating the HDD of an arbitrary query point $q$ relative to $P$ in $O(d \log n)$ time after preprocessing $P$, and for finding a median point of $P$ in $O(d n^{d^2} \log n)$ time. We study various properties of hyperplane distance depth and show that it is convex, symmetric, and vanishing at infinity.</description>

      <title>On inside-out Dissections of Polygons and Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study inside-out dissections of polygons and polyhedra. We first show that an arbitrary polygon can be inside-out dissected with $2n+1$ pieces, thereby improving the best previous upper bound of $4(n-2)$ pieces. Additionally, we establish that a regular polygon can be inside-out dissected with at most $6$ pieces. Lastly, we prove that any polyhedron that can be decomposed into finitely many regular tetrahedra and octahedra can be inside-out dissected.</description>

      <title>A Sparse Multicover Bifiltration of Linear Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-cover of a point cloud $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at radius $r$ is the set of all those points within distance $r$ of at least $k$ points of $X$. By varying the order $k$ and radius $r$ we obtain a two-parameter filtration known as the multicover bifiltration. This bifiltration has received attention recently due to being parameter-free and its robustness to outliers. However, it is hard to compute: the smallest known equivalent simplicial bifiltration has $O(|X|^{d+1})$ simplices, where $d$ is the dimension. In this paper we introduce a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation of the multicover that has linear size $O(|X|)$, for a fixed $d$ and $\epsilon$. The methods also apply to the subdivision Rips bifiltration on metric spaces of bounded doubling dimension to obtain analogous results.</description>

      <title>Modeling of non-planar slicer for improved surface quality in material extrusion 3D printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm to generate a 3D extruder path, combining classic planar and non-planar layers to enhance the surface quality and accuracy of complex 3D printed parts. Material extrusion 3D printing, due to its layer-by-layer construction method, produces parts with a discretization effect commonly referred to as the "staircase" effect, particularly on near-flat surfaces. The algorithm addresses this issue using a mixed-layer approach that uses 3D non-planar layers for the surfaces that would benefit from non-planar printing, and planar layers for the remaining regions. Existing studies have demonstrated similar combined layer methods but are often limited in the variety and complexity of shapes they can process due to their inherent slicing techniques. This algorithm presents a universal approach to non-planar extruder path generation by identifying the non-planar surfaces and generating non-planar extruder paths that conform to the object's surface. Subsequently, it identifies the space occupied by the non-planar layers and removes it from the original mesh to produce a collision-free planar-only mesh, sliced using classic planar methods. The algorithm was evaluated on objects of various complex shapes, comparing the results with outputs from standard planar slicers. The improvement in surface accuracy was also quantified by measuring the Chamfer Distance. Specifically, it is shown that the algorithm can generate non-planar extruder paths of complex geometries, improving surface quality.</description>

      <title>Hyperplanes Avoiding Problem and Integer Points Counting in Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our work, we consider the problem of computing a vector $x \in Z^n$ of minimum $\|\cdot\|_p$-norm such that $a^\top x \not= a_0$, for any vector $(a,a_0)$ from a given subset of $Z^n$ of size $m$. In other words, we search for a vector of minimum norm that avoids a given finite set of hyperplanes, which is natural to call as the $\textit{Hyperplanes Avoiding Problem}$. This problem naturally appears as a subproblem in Barvinok-type algorithms for counting integer points in polyhedra. More precisely, it appears when one needs to evaluate certain rational generating functions in an avoidable critical point. We show that:
  1) With respect to $\|\cdot\|_1$, the problem admits a feasible solution $x$ with $\|x\|_1 \leq (m+n)/2$, and show that such solution can be constructed by a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm with $O(n \cdot m)$ operations. Moreover, this inequality is the best possible. This is a significant improvement over the previous randomized algorithm, which computes $x$ with a guaranty $\|x\|_{1} \leq n \cdot m$. The original approach of A.~Barvinok can guarantee only $\|x\|_1 = O\bigl((n \cdot m)^n\bigr)$;
  2) The problem is NP-hard with respect to any norm $\|\cdot\|_p$, for $p \in \bigl(R_{\geq 1} \cup \{\infty\}\bigr)$.
  3) As an application, we show that the problem to count integer points in a polytope $P = \{x \in R^n \colon A x \leq b\}$, for given $A \in Z^{m \times n}$ and $b \in Q^m$, can be solved by an algorithm with $O\bigl(\nu^2 \cdot n^3 \cdot \Delta^3 \bigr)$ operations, where $\nu$ is the maximum size of a normal fan triangulation of $P$, and $\Delta$ is the maximum value of rank-order subdeterminants of $A$. It refines the previous state-of-the-art $O\bigl(\nu^2 \cdot n^4 \cdot \Delta^3\bigr)$-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>UAV survey coverage path planning of complex regions containing exclusion zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of UAV survey coverage path planning for areas that are complex concave polygons, containing exclusion zones or obstacles. While standard drone path planners typically generate coverage paths for simple convex polygons, this study proposes a method to manage more intricate regions, including boundary splits, merges, and interior holes. To achieve this, polygonal decomposition techniques are used to partition the target area into convex sub-regions. The sub-polygons are then merged using a depth-first search algorithm, followed by the generation of continuous Boustrophedon paths based on connected components. Polygonal offset by the straight skeleton method was used to ensure a constant safe distance from the exclusion zones. This approach allows UAV path planning in environments with complex geometric constraints.</description>
