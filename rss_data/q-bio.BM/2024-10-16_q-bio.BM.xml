      <title>DeltaDock: A Unified Framework for Accurate, Efficient, and Physically Reliable Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11224v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking, a technique for predicting ligand binding poses, is crucial in structure-based drug design for understanding protein-ligand interactions. Recent advancements in docking methods, particularly those leveraging geometric deep learning (GDL), have demonstrated significant efficiency and accuracy advantages over traditional sampling methods. Despite these advancements, current methods are often tailored for specific docking settings, and limitations such as the neglect of protein side-chain structures, difficulties in handling large binding pockets, and challenges in predicting physically valid structures exist. To accommodate various docking settings and achieve accurate, efficient, and physically reliable docking, we propose a novel two-stage docking framework, DeltaDock, consisting of pocket prediction and site-specific docking. We innovatively reframe the pocket prediction task as a pocket-ligand alignment problem rather than direct prediction in the first stage. Then we follow a bi-level coarse-to-fine iterative refinement process to perform site-specific docking. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DeltaDock. Notably, in the blind docking setting, DeltaDock achieves a 31\% relative improvement over the docking success rate compared with the previous state-of-the-art GDL model. With the consideration of physical validity, this improvement increases to about 300\%.</description>

      <title>It Takes Two to Tango: Directly Optimizing for Constrained Synthesizability in Generative Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained synthesizability is an unaddressed challenge in generative molecular design. In particular, designing molecules satisfying multi-parameter optimization objectives, while simultaneously being synthesizable and enforcing the presence of specific commercial building blocks in the synthesis. This is practically important for molecule re-purposing, sustainability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel reward function called TANimoto Group Overlap (TANGO), which uses chemistry principles to transform a sparse reward function into a dense and learnable reward function -- crucial for reinforcement learning. TANGO can augment general-purpose molecular generative models to directly optimize for constrained synthesizability while simultaneously optimizing for other properties relevant to drug discovery using reinforcement learning. Our framework is general and addresses starting-material, intermediate, and divergent synthesis constraints. Contrary to most existing works in the field, we show that incentivizing a general-purpose (without any inductive biases) model is a productive approach to navigating challenging optimization scenarios. We demonstrate this by showing that the trained models explicitly learn a desirable distribution. Our framework is the first generative approach to tackle constrained synthesizability.</description>
