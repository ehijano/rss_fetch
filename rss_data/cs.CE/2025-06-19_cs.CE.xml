      <title>Explain First, Trust Later: LLM-Augmented Explanations for Graph-Based Crypto Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decentralized finance (DeFi) community has grown rapidly in recent years, pushed forward by cryptocurrency enthusiasts interested in the vast untapped potential of new markets. The surge in popularity of cryptocurrency has ushered in a new era of financial crime. Unfortunately, the novelty of the technology makes the task of catching and prosecuting offenders particularly challenging. Thus, it is necessary to implement automated detection tools related to policies to address the growing criminality in the cryptocurrency realm.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Structural Vibrations via Guided Flow Matching Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required. We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives, including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from https://github.com/ecker-lab/Optimizing_Vibrating_Plates.</description>

      <title>Simulation of parametrized cardiac electrophysiology in three dimensions using physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively used to represent various physical systems across multiple scientific domains. The same can be said for cardiac electrophysiology, wherein fully-connected neural networks (FCNNs) have been employed to predict the evolution of an action potential in a 2D space following the two-parameter phenomenological Aliev-Panfilov (AP) model. In this paper, the training behaviour of PINNs is investigated to determine optimal hyperparameters to predict the electrophysiological activity of the myocardium in 3D according to the AP model, with the inclusion of boundary and material parameters. An FCNN architecture is employed with the governing partial differential equations in their strong form, which are scaled consistently with normalization of network inputs. The finite element (FE) method is used to generate training data for the network. Numerical examples with varying spatial dimensions and parameterizations are generated using the trained models. The network predicted fields for both the action potential and the recovery variable are compared with the respective FE simulations. Network losses are weighed with individual scalar values. Their effect on training and prediction is studied to arrive at a method of controlling losses during training.</description>

      <title>An improved point-to-surface contact algorithm with penalty method for peridynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is significantly challenging to obtain accurate contact forces in peridynamics (PD) simulations due to the difficulty of surface particles identification, particularly for complex geometries. Here, an improved point-to-surface contact model is proposed for PD with high accuracy. First, the outer surface is identified using the eigenvalue method and then we construct a Verlet list to identify potential contact particle pairs efficiently. Subsequently, a point-to-surface contact search algorithm is utilized to determine precise contact locations with the penalty function method calculating the contact force. Finally, the accuracy of this point-to-surface contact model is validated through several representative contact examples. The results demonstrate that the point-to-surface contact model model can predict contact forces and deformations with high accuracy, aligning well with the classical Hertz contact theory solutions. This work presents a contact model for PD that automatically recognizes external surface particles and accurately calculates the contact force, which provides guidance for the study of multi-body contact as well as complex contact situations.</description>

      <title>Higher-Oder Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. The DG discretization of the adapted second-order viscous terms is carried out via the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method, obviating auxiliary variables. Based on this spatial discretization, we compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) a higher-order DG discretization for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, ii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iii) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>

      <title>Advancing oncology with federated learning: transcending boundaries in breast, lung, and prostate cancer. A systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the limitations of centralised machine learning (ML) in oncology, particularly in overcoming privacy concerns and harnessing the power of diverse, multi-center data. This systematic review synthesises current knowledge on the state-of-the-art FL in oncology, focusing on breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Distinct from previous surveys, our comprehensive review critically evaluates the real-world implementation and impact of FL on cancer care, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing ML generalisability, performance and data privacy in clinical settings and data. We evaluated state-of-the-art advances in FL, demonstrating its growing adoption amid tightening data privacy regulations. FL outperformed centralised ML in 15 out of the 25 studies reviewed, spanning diverse ML models and clinical applications, and facilitating integration of multi-modal information for precision medicine. Despite the current challenges identified in reproducibility, standardisation and methodology across studies, the demonstrable benefits of FL in harnessing real-world data and addressing clinical needs highlight its significant potential for advancing cancer research. We propose that future research should focus on addressing these limitations and investigating further advanced FL methods, to fully harness data diversity and realise the transformative power of cutting-edge FL in cancer care.</description>

      <title>Entropy conservative and entropy stable solid wall boundary conditions for the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for imposing non-linear entropy conservative and entropy stable wall boundary conditions for the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations in the presence of an adiabatic wall or a wall with a prescribed heat entropy flow, addressing three scenarios: electrically insulating walls, thin walls with finite conductivity, and perfectly conducting walls. The procedure relies on the formalism and mimetic properties of diagonal-norm, summation-by-parts, and simultaneous-approximation-term operators. Using the method of lines, a semi-discrete entropy estimate for the entire domain is obtained when the proposed numerical imposition of boundary conditions is coupled with an entropy-conservative or entropy-stable discrete interior operator. The resulting estimate mimics the global entropy estimate obtained at the continuous level. The boundary data at the wall are weakly imposed using a penalty flux approach and a simultaneous-approximation-term technique for both the conservative variables and the gradient of the entropy variables. Discontinuous spectral collocation operators (mass lumped nodal discontinuous Galerkin operators) on high-order unstructured grids are used to demonstrate the new procedure's accuracy, robustness, and efficacy for weakly enforcing boundary conditions. Numerical simulations confirm the non-linear stability of the proposed technique, with applications to three-dimensional flows. The procedure described is compatible with any diagonal-norm summation-by-parts spatial operator, including finite element, finite difference, finite volume, nodal and modal discontinuous Galerkin, and flux reconstruction schemes.</description>

      <title>Cross-Chain Arbitrage: The Next Frontier of MEV in Decentralized Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) markets spread across Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) blockchains rely on arbitrage to keep prices aligned. Today most price gaps are closed against centralized exchanges (CEXes), whose deep liquidity and fast execution make them the primary venue for price discovery. As trading volume migrates on-chain, cross-chain arbitrage between decentralized exchanges (DEXes) will become the canonical mechanism for price alignment. Yet, despite its importance to DeFi-and the on-chain transparency making real activity tractable in a way CEX-to-DEX arbitrage is not-existing research remains confined to conceptual overviews and hypothetical opportunity analyses.
  We study cross-chain arbitrage with a profit-cost model and a year-long measurement. The model shows that opportunity frequency, bridging time, and token depreciation determine whether inventory- or bridge-based execution is more profitable. Empirically, we analyze one year of transactions (September 2023 - August 2024) across nine blockchains and identify 242,535 executed arbitrages totaling 868.64 million USD volume. Activity clusters on Ethereum-centric L1-L2 pairs, grows 5.5x over the study period, and surges-higher volume, more trades, lower fees-after the Dencun upgrade (March 13, 2024). Most trades use pre-positioned inventory (66.96%) and settle in 9s, whereas bridge-based arbitrages take 242s, underscoring the latency cost of today's bridges. Market concentration is high: the five largest addresses execute more than half of all trades, and one alone captures almost 40% of daily volume post-Dencun. We conclude that cross-chain arbitrage fosters vertical integration, centralizing sequencing infrastructure and economic power and thereby exacerbating censorship, liveness, and finality risks; decentralizing block building and lowering entry barriers are critical to countering these threats.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>
