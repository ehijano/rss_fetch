      <title>votess: A multi-target, GPU-capable, parallel Voronoi tessellator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: votess is a library for computing parallel 3D Voronoi tessellations on heterogeneous platforms, from CPUs and GPUs, to future accelerator architectures. To do so, it leverages the SYCL abstraction layer to achieve portability and performance across these architectures. The core library is an implementation of a Voronoi cell-by-cell computation algorithm, producing the geometry of the cells and their neighbor connectivity information, rather than a full combinatorial mesh data structure. This simplifies the Voronoi tessellation and makes it more suitable to data parallel architectures than alternatives such as sequential insertion or the Bowyer-Watson algorithm. The library demonstrates significant performance improvements over established single-threaded programs and serves as a foundational tool for performance-critical applications, such as on-the-fly computations in hydrodynamical codes.</description>

      <title>The PRISMA-36 array for studying variations of the thermal neutron flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From 2012 to 2023, the PRISMA-32 array was in operation at the Experimental Complex NEVOD (MEPhI, Moscow). The purpose of the array was to study extensive air showers by detecting the air-shower neutron and electron-photon components using unshielded neutron detectors. To expand the capabilities of this facility, including for the study of cosmic and geophysical phenomena with a neutron flux, its upgrade was carried out. During the upgrade, a dedicated measuring channel for studying variations of the neutron background and the processes affecting these variations was created. To achieve this, the photomultipliers, the integrating amplifiers, the digitalizing electronics and the high-voltage power supply system were replaced. The paper describes the structure of the upgraded array, which was named PRISMA-36, and presents the results of studying the characteristics of the main elements of its "variation" channel. A method for identifying signals caused by neutron capture and the determined criteria for their selection are discussed. An example of a Forbush decrease, caused by a X1.1-class flare and recorded with the variation channel of the PRISMA-36 array, is given.</description>

      <title>The Survey of Surveys: machine learning for stellar parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning method to assign stellar parameters (temperature, surface gravity, metallicity) to the photometric data of large photometric surveys such as SDSS and SKYMAPPER. The method makes use of our previous effort in homogenizing and recalibrating spectroscopic data from surveys like APOGEE, GALAH, or LAMOST into a single catalog, which is used to inform a neural network. We obtain spectroscopic-quality parameters for millions of stars that have only been observed photometrically. The typical uncertainties are of the order of 100K in temperature, 0.1 dex in surface gravity, and 0.1 dex in metallicity and the method performs well down to low metallicity, were obtaining reliable results is known to be difficult.</description>

      <title>FAST: A software suite for automatic weather and optical turbulence forecast on ground-based telescope sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we present the FAST, which is a comprehensive software suite that aims to streamline and automatically manage the forecast of atmospheric and astroclimatic parameters (provided respectively by Meso-Nh and Astro-Meso-Nh models) on large ground-based telescope installations. The forecast of the aforementioned parameters is becoming crucial for the operation of the large telescope installations which possess atmospheric-sensitive equipment equipped with Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. FAST performs automatically all the steps of an atmosphere forecast process: initialisation and forcing data, atmospheric simulation, postprocessing and managing of the outputs.The role of such service is useful both in optimizing beforehand AO instruments to the next atmospheric conditions and in planning telescope observations (especially in "service mode") in order to maximize the scientific output. FAST was applied first to the ALTA Center project, which provides forecasts for the LBT telescope. Then it was extended to the more recent project FATE that is a similar forecast system applied to the VLT. Since its first version FAST evolved and it has has been modified to fit with the different technical specifications of the different projects gaining in modularity. It is now able to provide forecasts on different timescales (from days to hours before) and to provide forecast during night and day time. After several years of continuous development we can say that FAST reached full maturity and it is now ready for applications to other projects/sites.</description>

      <title>A compact group lens modeled with GIGA-Lens: Enhanced inference for complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of large-scale astronomical surveys, fast modeling of strong lens systems has become increasingly vital. While significant progress has been made for galaxy-scale lenses, the development of automated methods for modeling larger systems, such as groups and clusters, is not as extensive. Our study aims to extend the capabilities of the GIGA-Lens code, enhancing its efficiency in modeling multi-galaxy strong lens systems. We focus on demonstrating the potential of GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference in handling complex lensing scenarios with a high number of free parameters. We employ an improved inference approach that combines image position and pixelated data with an annealing sampling technique to obtain the posterior distribution of complex models. This method allows us to overcome the challenge of limited prior information, a high number of parameters, and memory usage. Our process is exemplified through the analysis of the compact group lens system DES J0248-3955, for which we present VLT/X-shooter spectra. We measure a redshift of $z = 0.69 \pm 0.04$ for the group, and $z = 1.2722 \pm 0.0005$ for one of the extended arcs. Our enhanced method successfully constrained a lens model with 29 free parameters and lax priors in a remarkably short time. The mass of the lens is well described by a single dark-matter halo with a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v = (690 \pm 30) \, km \, s^{-1}$. The model predicts the presence of a second source at the same redshift and a third source at approximately $z \sim 2.7$. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of our lens modeling technique for dealing with a complex system in a short time using ground-based data. This presents considerable potential within the context of large surveys such as LSST.</description>

      <title>Machine learning approach for mapping the stable orbits around planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical N-body simulations are commonly used to explore stability regions around exoplanets, offering insights into the possible existence of satellites and ring systems. This study aims to utilize Machine Learning (ML) techniques to generate predictive maps of stable regions surrounding a hypothetical planet. The approach can also be extended to planet-satellite systems, planetary ring systems, and other similar configurations. A dataset was generated using 10^5 numerical simulations, each incorporating nine orbital features for the planet and a test particle in a star-planet-test particle system. The simulations were classified as stable or unstable based on stability criteria, requiring particles to remain stable over a timespan equivalent to 10,000 orbital periods of the planet. Various ML algorithms were tested and fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization to determine the most effective predictive model. Tree-based algorithms showed comparable accuracy in performance. The best-performing model, using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, achieved an accuracy of 98.48%, with 94% recall and precision for stable particles and 99% for unstable particles. ML algorithms significantly reduce the computational time required for three-body simulations, operating approximately 100,000 times faster than traditional numerical methods. Predictive models can generate entire stability maps in less than a second, compared to the days required by numerical simulations. The results from the trained ML models will be made accessible through a public web interface, enabling broader scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning application for stellar parameters determination: III- Denoising Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this third paper in a series, we investigate the need of spectra denoising for the derivation of stellar parameters. We have used two distinct datasets for this work. The first one contains spectra in the range of 4450-5400 {\AA} at a resolution of 42000 and the second in the range of 8400-8800 {\AA} at a resolution of 11500. We constructed two denoising techniques, an autoencoder, and a Principal Component Analysis. Using random Gaussian noise added to synthetic spectra, we have trained a Neural Network to derive the stellar parameters Teff, log g, ve sin i, {\xi}t, and [M/H] of the denoised spectra. We find that, independently of the denoising technique, the stellar parameters accuracy values do not improve once we denoise the synthetic spectra. This is true with and without applying data augmentation to the stellar parameters Neural Network.</description>

      <title>Performance of iDQ ahead of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA's fourth observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors used by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, and the Virgo Collaboration are incredibly sensitive instruments which frequently detect non-stationary, non-Gaussian noise transients. iDQ is a statistical inference framework which leverages the use of auxiliary degrees of freedom monitored in the detectors to identify such transients. In this work, we describe the improvements to the iDQ pipeline made between the third and fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, and show the performance of these changes. We find that iDQ detects a total of 39,398 of the known 100,512 glitches identified by Omicron over the course of the second half of the third observing run. We construct a measure of the probability a glitch is present in the strain data of a given detector by combining information from iDQ and Omicron as well as extend the output of iDQ in a novel method which finds correlations between known glitch classifications, and auxiliary channels. We identify several channels over the course of O3b which frequently record instances of Scattered Light, Whistle, and Blip glitches and discuss use cases for this method in active observing runs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: About one third of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) sources are unassociated. We perform multi-class classification of Fermi-LAT sources using machine learning with the goal of probabilistic classification of the unassociated sources. A particular attention is paid to the fact that the distributions of associated and unassociated sources are different as functions of source parameters. In this work, we address this problem in the framework of dataset shifts in machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The results of simultaneous measurements of noctilucent clouds (NLC) position in a number of ground-based locations are presented. Observational data of 14 bright NLC events over 5 years is used for building the altitude maps of cloud fields using triangulation technique updated for multi-location case. Statistical distribution of NLC altitude and its change during the summer season is considered. Mean NLC altitudes are compared with colorimetric technique based on the same data and simple radiation transfer model. This can be used to check the model and estimate the accuracy of single-camera technique of NLC altitude measurements. Results and methods are suggested for net ground-based survey of noctilucent clouds.</description>

      <title>The neutron veto of the XENONnT experiment: Results with demineralized water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05264v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiogenic neutrons emitted by detector materials are one of the most challenging backgrounds for the direct search of dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). To mitigate this background, the XENONnT experiment is equipped with a novel gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detector, which encloses the xenon dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC). The neutron veto (NV) tags neutrons via their capture on gadolinium or hydrogen, which release $\gamma$-rays that are subsequently detected as Cherenkov light. In this work, we present the key features and the first results of the XENONnT NV when operated with demineralized water in the initial phase of the experiment. Its efficiency for detecting neutrons is $(82\pm 1)\,\%$, the highest neutron detection efficiency achieved in a water Cherenkov detector. This enables a high efficiency of $(53\pm 3)\,\%$ for the tagging of WIMP-like neutron signals, inside a tagging time window of $250\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ between TPC and NV, leading to a livetime loss of $1.6\,\%$ during the first science run of XENONnT.</description>

Abstract: The emerging era of big data in radio astronomy demands more efficient and higher-quality processing of observational data. While deep learning methods have been applied to tasks such as automatic radio frequency interference (RFI) detection, these methods often face limitations, including dependence on training data and poor generalization, which are also common issues in other deep learning applications within astronomy. In this study, we investigate the use of the open-source image recognition and segmentation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), and its optimized version, HQ-SAM, due to their impressive generalization capabilities. We evaluate these models across various tasks, including RFI detection and solar radio burst (SRB) identification. For RFI detection, HQ-SAM (SAM) shows performance that is comparable to or even superior to the SumThreshold method, especially with large-area broadband RFI data. In the search for SRBs, HQ-SAM demonstrates strong recognition abilities for Type II and Type III bursts. Overall, with its impressive generalization capability, SAM (HQ-SAM) can be a promising candidate for further optimization and application in RFI and event detection tasks in radio astronomy.</description>

Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) poses a significant challenge in radio astronomy, arising from terrestrial and celestial sources, disrupting observations conducted by radio telescopes. Addressing RFI involves intricate heuristic algorithms, manual examination, and, increasingly, machine learning methods. Given the dynamic and temporal nature of radio astronomy observations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerge as a promising approach. In this study, we cast RFI detection as a supervised multi-variate time-series segmentation problem. Notably, our investigation explores the encoding of radio astronomy visibility data for SNN inference, considering six encoding schemes: rate, latency, delta-modulation, and three variations of the step-forward algorithm. We train a small twolayer fully connected SNN on simulated data derived from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope and perform extensive hyper-parameter optimization. Results reveal that latency encoding exhibits superior performance, achieving a per-pixel accuracy of 98.8% and an f1-score of 0.761. Remarkably, these metrics approach those of contemporary RFI detection algorithms, notwithstanding the simplicity and compactness of our proposed network architecture. This study underscores the potential of RFI detection as a benchmark problem for SNN researchers, emphasizing the efficacy of SNNs in addressing complex time-series segmentation tasks in radio astronomy.</description>

      <title>Water in protoplanetary disks with JWST-MIRI: spectral excitation atlas and radial distribution from temperature diagnostic diagrams and Doppler mapping</title>

Abstract: This work aims at providing fundamental general tools for the analysis of water spectra as observed in protoplanetary disks with JWST-MIRI. We analyze 25 high-quality spectra from the JDISC Survey reduced with asteroid calibrators as presented in Pontoppidan et al. (2024). First, we present a spectral atlas to illustrate the clustering of H$_2$O transitions from different upper level energies ($E_u$) and identify single (un-blended) transitions that provide the most reliable measurements. With that, we demonstrate two important excitation effects: the opacity saturation of ortho-para line pairs that overlap, and the non-LTE excitation of $v=1-1$ lines scattered across the $v=0-0$ rotational band. Second, we define a shorter list of fundamental lines spanning $E_u=$ 1500-6000 K to develop simple line-ratio diagnostic diagrams for the radial temperature distribution of water in inner disks, which can be interpreted using discrete temperature components or a radial gradient. Third, we report the detection of disk-rotation Doppler broadening of molecular lines, which confirms the radial distribution of water emission including, for the first time, the radially-extended $\approx$ 170-220 K reservoir close to the snowline. The combination of measured line ratios and broadening suggests that drift-dominated disks have shallower temperature gradients with an extended cooler disk surface enriched by ice sublimation. We also report the first detection of a H$_2$O-rich inner disk wind from narrow blue-shifted absorption in the ro-vibrational lines. We summarize these findings and tools into a general recipe to make the study of water in planet-forming regions reliable, effective, and sustainable for samples of $&gt; 100$ disks.</description>

      <title>Capturing Turbulence with Numerical Dissipation: a Simple Dynamical Model for Unresolved Turbulence in Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>

Abstract: Modeling unresolved turbulence in astrophysical gasdynamic simulations can improve the modeling of other subgrid processes dependent on the turbulent structure of gas: from flame propagation in the interiors of combusting white dwarfs to star formation and chemical reaction rates in the interstellar medium, and non-thermal pressure support of circum- and intergalactic gas. We present a simple method for modeling unresolved turbulence in hydrodynamic simulations via tracking its sourcing by local numerical dissipation and modeling its decay into heat. This method is physically justified by the generic property of turbulent flows that they dissipate kinetic energy at a rate set by the energy cascade rate from large scales, which is independent of fluid viscosity regardless of its nature, be it physical or numerical. We calibrate and test our model against decaying supersonic turbulence simulations. Despite its simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces multiple non-trivial features of the high-resolution turbulence run: the temporal evolution of the average small-scale turbulence, its dependence on spatial scale, and the slope and scatter of the local correlation between subgrid turbulent velocities, gas densities, and local compression rates. As an example of practical applications, we use our model in isolated galactic disk simulations to model locally variable star formation efficiency at the subresolution scale. In the supersonic, star-forming gas, the new model performs comparably to a more sophisticated model where the turbulent cascade is described by explicit subgrid terms. Our new model is straightforward to implement in many hydrodynamic codes used in galaxy simulations as it utilizes already existing infrastructure to implicitly track the numerical dissipation in such codes.</description>
