      <title>Export proceeds repatriation policies: A shield against exchange rate volatility in emerging markets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of mandatory export proceeds repatriation on exchange rate stability in three emerging markets, Iran, Sri Lanka, and Turkey, using the Generalized Synthetic Control framework. By modeling exchange rate stochastic volatility as our outcome of interest and controlling for interest rate differentials, exchange rate regime shifts, and inflation rate gaps, we address both unobserved time-varying confounders and heterogeneous treatment effects. Our estimates reveal no statistically significant impact of repatriation mandates on exchange-rate volatility across the three countries. We also find that we cannot reject the possibility of a non-zero impact. These results remain robust to an extensive range of sensitivity analyses, including alternative covariate specifications and placebo tests, thereby confirming their reliability.</description>

      <title>A causal evaluation of Bogota's cable car illustrates the transformative potential of mobile phone data for policy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport infrastructure is vital to the functioning of cities. However, assessing the impact of transport policies on urban mobility and behaviour is often costly and time-consuming, particularly in low-data environments. We demonstrate how GPS location data derived from smartphones, available at high spatial granularity and in near real time, can be used to conduct causal impact evaluation, capturing broad mobility and interaction patterns beyond the scope of traditional sources such as surveys or administrative data. We illustrate this approach by assessing the impact of a 2018 cable car system connecting a peripheral low-income neighbourhood in Bogota to the bus rapid transit (BRT) system. Using a difference-in-differences event study design, we compare people living near the new cable car line to people living in similar areas near planned stations of a future line. We find that the cable car increased mobility by approximately 6.5 trips per person per month, with most trips within the local neighbourhood and to the city centre. However, we find limited evidence of increased encounters between the low income cable car residents and other socioeconomic groups, suggesting that while the cable car improved access to urban amenities and quality of life, its impact on everyday socioeconomic mixing was more modest. Our study highlights the potential of mobile phone data to capture previously hard-to-measure outcomes of transport policies, such as socioeconomic mixing.</description>

      <title>TrendFolios: A Portfolio Construction Framework for Utilizing Momentum and Trend-Following In a Multi-Asset Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a portfolio construction framework and implement an active investment strategy utilizing momentum and trend-following signals across multiple asset classes and asset class risk factors. We quantify the performance of this strategy to demonstrate its ability to create excess returns above industry standard benchmarks, as well as manage volatility and drawdown risks over a 22+ year period.</description>

      <title>Early and Accurate Recession Detection Using Classifiers on the Anticipation-Precision Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a new method for detecting US recessions in real time. The method constructs millions of recession classifiers by combining unemployment and vacancy data to reduce detection noise. Classifiers are then selected to avoid both false negatives (missed recessions) and false positives (nonexistent recessions). The selected classifiers are therefore perfect, in that they identify all 15 historical recessions in the training period without any false positives. By further selecting classifiers that lie on the high-precision segment of the anticipation-precision frontier, the method optimizes early detection without sacrificing precision. On average, over 1929--2021, the classifier ensemble signals recessions 2.2 months after their true onset, with a standard deviation of 1.9 months. Applied to May 2025 data, the classifier ensemble gives a 71% probability that the US economy is currently in recession. Backtesting to 2004, 1984, and 1964 confirms the algorithm's reliability. Algorithms trained on limited historical windows continue to detect all subsequent recessions without errors. Furthermore, they all detect the Great Recession by mid-2008 -- even when they are only trained on data up to 1984 or 1964. The classifier ensembles trained on 1929--2004, 1929--1984, and 1929--1964 data give a current recession probability of 58%, 83%, and 25%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Measuring Communication Quality of Interest Rate Announcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use text-mining techniques to measure the accessibility and quality of information within the texts of interest rate announcements published by the Bank of Israel over the past decade. We find that comprehension of interest rate announcements published by the Bank of Israel requires fewer years of education than interest rate announcements published by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. In addition, we show that the sentiment within these announcements is aligned with economic fluctuations. We also find that textual uncertainty is correlated with the volatility of the domestic financial market.</description>

      <title>The COVID-19 Inflation Weighting in Israel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant shifts in the composition of consumer spending as a result of the COVID-19 crisis can complicate the interpretation of official inflation data, which are calculated by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) based on a fixed basket of goods. We focus on Israel as a country that experienced three lockdowns, additional restrictions that significantly changed consumer behavior, and a successful vaccination campaign that has led to the lifting of most of these restrictions. We use credit card spending data to construct a consumption basket of goods representing the composition of household consumption during the COVID-19 period. We use this synthetic COVID-19 basket to calculate the adjusted inflation rate that should prevail during the pandemic period. We find that the differences between COVID-19-adjusted and CBS (unadjusted) inflation measures are transitory. Only the contribution of certain goods and services, particularly housing and transportation, to inflation changed significantly, especially during the first and second lockdowns. Although lockdowns and restrictions in developed countries created a significant bias in inflation weighting, the inflation bias remained unexpectedly small and transitory during the COVID-19 period in Israel.</description>
