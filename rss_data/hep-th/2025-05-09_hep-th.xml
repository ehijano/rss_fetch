      <title>Modular chaos, operator algebras, and the Berry phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular Berry transport associates a geometric phase to a zero mode ambiguity in a family of modular operators. In holographic settings, this phase was shown to encode nontrivial information about the emergent spacetime geometry. We reformulate modular Berry transport for arbitrary von Neumann algebras, including giving a precise definition of the zero mode projection in terms of a conditional expectation. For a certain class of state perturbations, we demonstrate that the modular Berry phase gives rise to an emergent symplectic form in the large $N$ limit, extending related results in the context of subregion/subalgebra duality. We also show that the vanishing of the Berry curvature for modular scrambling modes signals the emergence of a local Poincar\'e algebra, which plays a key role in the quantum ergodic hierarchy. These results provide an intriguing relation between geometric phases, modular chaos and the local structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>QNM orthogonality relations for AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present orthogonality relations for quasinormal modes of a wide class of asymptotically AdS black holes. The definition is obtained from a standard product, modified by a CPT operator and placed on a complex radial contour which avoids branch points of the modes. They are inspired by existing constructions for de Sitter and Kerr spacetimes. The CPT operator is needed to map right eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian into left eigenfunctions. The radial contour connects two copies of the dual QFT on a thermal Schwinger-Keldysh contour, making contact with real-time holography and the double cone wormhole.</description>

      <title>Analytic Properties of Infrared-Finite Amplitudes in Theories with Long-Range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared divergences obscure important analytic properties of scattering amplitudes, indicating gaps in our understanding of unitarity, causality, and crossing symmetry in theories with long-range forces. Using the exactly solvable model of a charged scalar particle in a fixed Coulomb background, we demonstrate that novel analytic properties arise and can be systematically studied when long-range interactions are properly incorporated. We first canonically quantize a scalar particle in a Coulomb potential, confirming that basic conditions for unitarity and causality hold. We then examine the necessary modifications to the LSZ reduction formula, the general optical theorem, and the treatment of the disconnected components of scattering amplitudes. Next, we show that the Coulomb phase divergence is analytically related to real radiative divergences via crossing symmetry, implying that a well-defined treatment of the Coulomb phase divergence provides constraints on the real radiative divergence. In contrast to the Faddeev-Kulish approach, we propose that an effective way to eliminate infrared divergences and study these analytic properties is to fully solve the quantum theory associated with the asymptotic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Modularity, 4d mirror symmetry, and VOA modules of 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ SCFTs with $a = c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infinite series of 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ SCFTs with central charge relation $a_\text{4d} = c_\text{4d}$ are closely related to the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. In this paper we study the modular properties of their associated VOAs $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{p,N}]$ where $\mathcal{T}_{p, N}$ are those $a = c$ theories with $SU(N)$ gauge group. We exploit the closed-form formula for the Schur index of the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ theories $\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}$ to derive the space of characters of the VOA $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{p,N}]$ and the $S, T$-matrices, and find the (non-monic) modular linear differential equations that constrain the module characters when possible. We investigate the geometric interpretation of some of these modular data through the view point of 4d mirror symmetry. Using insights from the flavored modular differential equation and defect index, we investigate a map between modules characters of $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ and those of $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{p,N}]$.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian dynamics of 3D gravity-coupled topological matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of two one-form topological matter fields minimally coupled to first-order gravity in three-dimensional spacetime using the Dirac Hamiltonian formalism. Working in the full phase space, we systematically identify the complete set of constraints of the system, classify them into first- and second-class, and compute their Poisson bracket algebra. The constraint analysis confirms the absence of physical degrees of freedom, consistent with the system's topological character. Furthermore, we construct the generating functional for gauge transformations and demonstrate that, with appropriate gauge parameter mappings, these transformations recover the full diffeomorphism and Poincar\'e symmetries of the theory. Finally, we explicitly compute the Dirac brackets, establishing the symplectic structure of the reduced phase space.</description>

      <title>Probing the multipolar structure of Myers-Perry black holes with scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the scattering of massive scalar probes off Myers-Perry black holes in the Kerr-Schild gauge. Extending the analysis performed recently for Kerr(-Newman) black holes, we show that the Kerr-Schild gauge allows to write down the tree-level scattering amplitude for Myers-Perry black holes in analytic form. For generic values of the angular momenta, Myers-Perry solutions have a richer multipolar structure compared to their four-dimensional counterparts, because they are characterized by the presence of stress multipoles, together with the more familiar mass and current multipoles. By focusing on the five-dimensional case, we derive the leading eikonal phase from the scattering amplitude and we give an explicit expression for two limiting scenari, namely when the two angular momenta are the same, so that the mass multipoles vanish but still the solution has a non-vanishing stress quadrupole and a current dipole, and when one of the two angular momenta is zero, and correspondingly the stress multipoles vanish similar to the Kerr case.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relation on black branes with arbitrary cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the Goon-Penco(GP) relationship in (n+1)-dimensional black branes with an arbitrary cosmological constant. Our analysis revealed that the GP relation preserved its form in four-dimensional and (n+1)-dimensional spacetimes, demonstrating its universal behavior with respect to dimensionality. Furthermore, we established that the GP relation exhibits universality across all states of the black hole, including those associated with the event horizon and the cosmological horizon. These findings confirm that the GP relationship remains valid for (n+1)-dimensional black holes and black branes with an arbitrary cosmological constant, independent of the coordinate system employed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail the internal structure of rotationally invariant higher-charge Abelian-Higgs vortices. The symmetry of the normal modes close to the critical regime for type II vortices determines the possible disintegration channels. The full internal mode structure is discussed, finding modes that conserve the vortex symmetry (Derrick type modes) and modes whose symmetry differs (multipolar modes).</description>

      <title>BMS representations for generic supermomentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classification, and give explicit realisations, of unitary irreducible representations of the BMS group. As compared to McCarthy's seminal work, we make use of a unique, Lorentz-invariant, decomposition of supermomenta into a hard and a soft piece, that we introduce and properly define, to investigate the extent to which generic representations depart from usual Poincar\'e particles and highlight their relations to gravitational infrared physics. We insist on making wavefunctions as explicit as possible. Similarly, we explain how branching to a Poincar\'e subgroup works in practice: this is physically relevant because this amounts to reading off the field content of a given BMS state in terms of a choice of gravity vacuum. In particular, we emphasise how different gravity vacua differ in their interpretation of the same BMS state, here again providing concrete examples as well as the general procedure. Finally, we demonstrate on an example that generic BMS particles are flexible enough to encode memory, as opposed to usual Poincar\'e particles.</description>

      <title>Boundary Energy-Momentum Tensors for Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 3D and 4D asymptotically flat spacetimes near future null infinity endowed with the most general allowed Carroll geometry. We define a boundary energy-momentum tensor by varying the on-shell action with respect to the Carroll metric data. This requires adding counterterms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We show that, in 4D, the shear is on par with the Carroll metric data. Their combined response defines a boundary energy-momentum-news complex whose diffeomorphism Ward identity is equivalent to the Bondi mass and angular momentum loss equations. Weyl invariance leads to an identity for the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and local Carroll boosts are anomalous in 3D and in 4D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stress-energy tensor of a massless, conformally coupled, quantum scalar field in a rigidly-rotating thermal state on three- and four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time. We first find the stress-energy tensor using relativistic kinetic theory, modelling the field as a thermal gas of massless bosons. We then compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the scalar field in quantum field theory and compare it with that resulting from relativistic kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Screened Axio-dilaton Cosmology: Novel Forms of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of multi-field Dark Energy, using a well-motivated axio-dilaton model that contains the minimal number of fields to have the 2-derivative sigma-model interactions that power-counting arguments show naturally compete with General Relativity at low energies. Our analysis differs from earlier, related, studies by treating the case where the dilaton's couplings to matter are large enough to require screening to avoid unacceptable dilaton-mediated forces in the solar system. We use a recently proposed screening mechanism that exploits the interplay between stronger-than-gravitational axion-matter couplings with the 2-derivative axion-dilaton interactions to suppress the couplings of the dilaton to bulk matter. The required axion-matter couplings also modify cosmology, with the axion's background energy density turning out to resemble early dark energy. We compute the properties of the axion fluid describing the rapid oscillations of the axion field around the time-dependent minimum of its matter-dependent effective potential, extending the usual formalism to include nontrivial kinetic sigma-model interactions. We explore the implications of these models for the Cosmic Microwave Background and the growth of structure and find that for dilaton potentials of the Albrecht-Skordis form (itself well-motivated by UV physics), successful screening can be consistent with the early dark energy temporarily comprising as much as 10% of the total density in the past. We find that increasing the dilaton-matter coupling decreases the growth of structure due to enhanced Hubble friction, an effect that dominates the usual fifth-force effects that amplify structure growth.</description>

      <title>Parity anomaly from LSM: exact valley symmetries on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the honeycomb tight-binding model hosts an exact microscopic avatar of its low-energy SU(2) valley symmetry and parity anomaly. Specifically, the SU(2) valley symmetry arises from a collection of conserved, integer-quantized charge operators that obey the Onsager algebra. Along with lattice reflection and time-reversal symmetries, this Onsager symmetry has a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly that matches the parity anomaly in the IR. Indeed, we show that any local Hamiltonian commuting with these symmetries cannot have a trivial unique gapped ground state. We study the phase diagram of the simplest symmetric model and survey various deformations, including Haldane's mass term, which preserves only the Onsager symmetry. Our results place the parity anomaly in 2+1D alongside Schwinger's anomaly in 1+1D and Witten's SU(2) anomaly in 3+1D as 't Hooft anomalies that can arise from the Onsager symmetry on the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) exploits the existence of correlations to enable remote energy transfer without without the need for physical energy carriers between emitter and receiver. This paper presents a review of the thermodynamic foundations of QET and reviews its first experimental demonstration (performed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), along with its implementation on publicly available superconducting quantum hardware. Additionally, we review an application of QET in the field of quantum thermodynamics as an efficient algorithmic cooling technique to cool down individual parts of interacting systems. Finally, we will review how QET can be employed to optimally generate exotic quantum states characterized by negative average stress-energy densities, offering a new operational approach to engineering such states which are promising in the context of semiclassical gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for relaxing a gauge theory CP violating phase in discrete steps to very small values. The idea is that the CP violating phase includes the magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux which can discharge by the nucleation of membranes. Inside the bubbles surrounded by the membranes, the total CP violating phase is reduced. When the bubbles are produced rapidly during radiation domination in the early universe, near the chiral symmetry breaking scale, they will collide and percolate, melting away into gauge theory radiation and dramatically relaxing CP violation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlations across the horizon could be pivotal in unveiling the puzzles surrounding quantum aspects of black holes and Hawking radiation. The peaks in the equal time correlation function are typically attributed to the entangled particle excitations. In this work, we have investigated the evolution of the correlations of a test quantum field on a dynamical background spacetime undergoing gravitational collapse. In the case of super-critical collapse, as the black hole and its horizon forms, correlated peaks are seen to appear across the horizon, representing an entangled Hawking pair. The outside peak moves away from the horizon as the system evolves, possibly representing outgoing Hawking flux. The implications of these non-local correlations are discussed in light of information paradox, quantum atmosphere and analogue black holes.</description>

We show that current direct-detection constraints on these interactions are more than an order of magnitude weaker than those for flavor-universal couplings: effective scales in the few-TeV range remain allowed by existing data, leaving open the possibility of a connection between this type of new physics and a solution to the electroweak hierarchy problem. Imposing the observed relic abundance from thermal freeze-out within the same effective theory, a well-defined region for a fermionic DM candidate with mass in the 1-2 TeV range emerges. Notably, this region will be fully probed by upcoming direct-detection experiments. Finally, we show that additional parameter space for both fermion and scalar cases can be recovered by going beyond the effective theory, through the introduction of a suitable vector mediator enabling resonant DM annihilation.</description>

      <title>Dissipation meets conformal interface: How the relaxation rate is suppressed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal interfaces play an important role in quantum critical systems. In closed systems, the transmission properties of conformal interfaces are typically characterized by two quantities: One is the effective central charge $c_{\text{eff}}$, which measures the amount of quantum entanglement through the interface, and the other is the transmission coefficient $c_{\text{LR}}$, which measures the energy transmission through the interface. In the present work, to characterize the transmission property of conformal interfaces in open quantum systems, we propose a third quantity $c_{\text{relax}}$, which is defined through the ratio of Liouvillian gaps with and without an interface. Physically, $c_{\text{relax}}$ measures the suppression of the relaxation rate towards a steady state when the system is subject to a local dissipation. We perform both analytical perturbation calculations and exact numerical calculations based on a free fermion chain at the critical point. It is found that $c_{\text{relax}}$ decreases monotonically with the strength of the interface. In particular, $0\le c_{\text{relax}}\le c_{\text{LR}}\le c_{\text{eff}}$, where the equalities hold if and only if the interface is totally reflective or totally transmissive. Our result for $c_{\text{relax}}$ is universal in the sense that $c_{\text{relax}}$ is independent of (i) the dissipation strength in the weak dissipation regime and (ii) the location where the local dissipation is introduced. Comparing to the previously known $c_{\text{LR}}$ and $c_{\text{eff}}$ in a closed system, our $c_{\text{relax}}$ shows a distinct behavior as a function of the interface strength, suggesting its novelty to characterize conformal interfaces in open systems and offering insights into critical systems under dissipation.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries and anomalies in quantum lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an 't Hooft anomaly index for a group acting on a 2d quantum lattice system by finite-depth circuits. It takes values in the degree-4 cohomology of the group and is an obstruction to on-siteability of the group action. We introduce a 3-group (modeled as a crossed square) describing higher symmetries of a 2d lattice system and show that the 2d anomaly index is an obstruction for promoting a symmetry action to a morphism of 3-groups. This demonstrates that 't Hooft anomalies are a consequence of a mixing between ordinary symmetries and higher symmetries. Similarly, to any 1d lattice system we attach a 2-group (modeled as a crossed module) and interpret the Nayak-Else anomaly index as an obstruction for promoting a group action to a morphism of 2-groups. The meaning of indices of Symmetry Protected Topological states is also illuminated by higher group symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the Higher Categorical Structure of Topological Defects in Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying mathematical framework describing the higher categorical structures formed by topological defects in quantum field theory equipped with tangential structures, such as orientations, framings, or $\operatorname{Pin}^{\pm}$-structures, in terms of structured versions of higher dagger categories. This recovers all previously known results, including the description of oriented topological defects in 2-dimensional quantum field theories by pivotal bicategories. Assuming the stratified cobordism hypothesis, we prove our proposal for topological defects with stable tangential structures that admit a direct sum in fully extended topological quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Mass, Charge, and Angular Momentum in Black Hole Evaporation: a Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of the evaporation dynamics of Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Reissner- Nordstrom black holes, focusing on the evolution of their mass, charge, and angular momentum, using detailed calculations of the corresponding Page factors. We investigate the evolution of black holes during the evaporation process, emphasizing how these quantities evolve relative to one another. Our study incorporates the effects of greybody factors, near-extremal conditions, and the introduction of additional particle species beyond the Standard Model. We demonstrate that the addition of particle degrees of freedom may significantly alter the evaporation hierarchy, potentially leading to scenarios in which the effective black hole charge increases during evaporation. Additionally, we examine the impact of Schwinger pair production and of super-radiance on charged, spinning black hole evaporation. These findings offer new insights into the complex interplay between different black hole parameters during evaporation and highlight the importance of considering additional particle species in the process.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac Fermions on Honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study superconducting (SC) phases that are naturally proximate to a spin-orbit coupled SU(8) Dirac semi-metal on a honeycomb lattice. This system, which offers enhanced low-energy symmetries, presents an interesting platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity in j=3/2 electrons. In particular, we find 72 superconducting charge-$2e$ fermion bilinears which, under classification of microscopic symmetries, lead to 12 different SCs -- four singlets, two doublets, and six triplets -- 7 of them are gapped and 5 are symmetry-protected nodal SCs. The strong spin-orbit coupling leads to locking of the spin of the Cooper pairs with real-space direction -- as is evident from the structure of the Cooper pair wave-functions -- leading to unusual non-unitary superconductors (even singlets), and with finite momentum pairing (for the triplets). This results, in many cases, in the magnitude of multiple pairing gaps being intricately dependent on the direction of the SC order-parameter. The present classification of SCs along with normal phases (Phys. Rev. B 108, 245106 (2023)) provides the complete list of naturally occurring phases in the vicinity of such a SU(8) Dirac semi-metal. This study allows for understanding the global phase diagram of such systems, stimulating further experimental work on candidate materials such as metallic halides (MX$_3$ with M=Zr, Hf, and X=Cl, Br). Further, it provides the starting point for the exploration of unconventional phase transitions in such systems.</description>

      <title>Ghost-induced phase transition in the final stages of black hole evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel scenario in which a quantum-induced ghost instability drives the natural evolution of an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole toward a stable naked singularity. This process, arising from quadratic curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high energies, circumvents the inconsistencies associated with classical naked singularities. The onset of ghost-driven instability signals a phase transition that fundamentally alters black hole evaporation, rendering the information paradox moot as it merges with the singularity issue. Our findings suggest a new pathway for black hole evolution at high-energy scales, offering insights that may bridge key gaps until a full theory of quantum gravity is realized.</description>

      <title>Effective ALP-Photon Coupling in External Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete calculation of the one-loop fermionic correction to the effective coupling between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons within a constant, homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary strength. This interaction, responsible for the Primakoff effect, is central to detecting axion-like particles in astrophysical settings and terrestrial experiments like helioscopes and haloscopes. Accurately predicting the interaction rate requires accounting for quantum corrections. Our work tackles this by employing magnetically enhanced fermion propagators derived using Schwinger's proper time method and a systematic Lorentz decomposition using the Ritus basis. We evaluate the triangle loop diagram exactly, avoiding approximations on field strength or particle kinematics.</description>

Abstract: We consider the addition to the Standard Model of a scalar $SU(2)$ multiplet $\Delta_n$ with dimension $n$ going from $1$ to $6$. The multiplet $\Delta_n$ is assumed to have null vacuum expectation value and an arbitrary (free) hypercharge. We determine the shape of the phase space for the new terms that appear in the scalar potential (SP); we observe in particular that, in the case of a 6-plet, the phase space is slightly concave along one of its boundaries. We determine the bounded-from-below and vacuum stability conditions on the SP for each value of $n$.</description>

Abstract: We reassess foundational aspects of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) in light of the Dressing Field Method, a tool allowing to systematically build gauge-invariant field variables. To get MAG started, one has to deal with the problem of "gauge translations". We first recall that Cartan geometry is the proper mathematical foundation for gauge theories of gravity, and that this problem never arises in that framework, which still allows to clarify the geometric status of gauge translations. Then, we show how the MAG kinematics is obtained via dressing in a technically streamlined way, which highlights that it reduces to a Cartan-geometric kinematics.</description>

      <title>Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as ultra-long period objects after a dormant cooling epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-long period transients (ULPs) are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for isolated ULPs, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$~hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as Galactic ULPs may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states describing a putative holographic dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of a time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

Abstract: We study the back-reaction of a quantum scalar field on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. The renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a massless, conformally-coupled quantum scalar field on global AdS space-time in four space-time dimensions acts as a source term on the right-hand-side of the Einstein equations for the quantum-corrected metric. We solve the quantum-corrected Einstein equations numerically and find deviations from pure AdS which increase as the temperature of the quantum scalar field state increases. We interpret these quantum-corrected metrics as asymptotically-AdS solitons, and study the mass of these solitons as a function of the temperature of the quantum scalar field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a massive self-interacting scalar quantum field in a Lorentz-violation scenario based on a Horava-Lifshitz model. Specifically, we investigate the vacuum energy density and its loop correction, up to first order in the self-interaction coupling constant, and also the topological mass generation. These quantities are also analyzed in the case where the field is massless. The scalar vacuum state is perturbed by the presence of two large parallel plates, placed at a distance L from each other, due to the imposition of Dirichlet boundary condition on the two plates. To perform this study, the effective potential approach in quantum field theory is applied.</description>

We study the integrated correlator between a half-BPS Wilson line and two Higgs branch operators of conformal dimension 2. Using supersymmetric localization, we resum the perturbative series for this observable and obtain exact expressions for both the planar and next-to-planar terms of its large $N$ expansion, valid for arbitrary values of the 't Hooft coupling. Finally, through a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we determine the leading terms of the corresponding strong-coupling expansions.</description>

      <title>Topological 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, and $A_\infty$-categories of Six, Five, and Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homologies of six and five-manifolds, and the Floer homology of four-manifolds from [arXiv:2311.18302] -- where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>

      <title>Gravity and Unification: Insights from SL(2N,C) Gauge Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11854v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perspective that gravity may govern the unification of all known elementary forces calls for an extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group $SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ reflects the internal $SU(N)$ symmetry subgroup. This extension is shown to lead to a consistent hyperunification framework, provided that the tetrad fields of $% SL(2,C)$ retain their invertibility condition in the extended theory, thus maintaining their connection to gravity. As a result -- while the full gauge multiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ typically comprises vector, axial-vector and tensor field submultiplets of $SU(N)$ -- only the vector submultiplet and singlet tensor field may manifest in an observed particle spectrum. The axial-vector submultiplet remains decoupled from ordinary matter, while the tensor submultiplet acquires the Planck scale order mass. Consequently, the effective symmetry of the theory reduces to $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$, bringing together $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity and $SU(N)$ grand unification. As all states in $SL(2N,C)$ are also classified by their spin magnitudes, some $% SU(N)$ grand unified models, including the standard $SU(5)$, appear unsuitable for the standard spin-$1/2$ quarks and leptons. However, applying $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to a model of composite quarks and leptons, where constituent chiral preons form the fundamental representations, identifies $% SL(16,C)$ with its effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most compelling candidate for hyperunification of the existing fundamental forces.</description>

      <title>RPST-Inspired Formalism for Black Holes in Flat Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel formalism for the thermodynamics of flat black holes, inspired by the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) framework. Our construction is motivated by the observed similarities in the thermodynamic behavior of flat black holes within the R\'enyi entropy framework and that of AdS black holes described by the Bekenstein entropy regime. The RPST framework is, by construction, exclusive to AdS black holes because it depends on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which is linked to the central charge $C$ of the dual conformal field theory (CFT). However, for non-AdS black holes, where $\Lambda$ is absent, we introduce a deformation parameter $\lambda$ to replace the central charge $C$. This RPST-inspired formalism incorporates $\lambda$ and its conjugate variable, the response potential $\zeta$, as a new pair of thermodynamic variables, analogous to the central charge $C$ and chemical potential $\mu$ in the AdS case. To illustrate the applicability of this formalism, we analyze two examples: the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) flat black hole and the Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>Monopoles, Dirac Strings and Generalised Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dirac's formulation of magnetic monopoles is shown to be equivalent to Maxwell theory coupled to 2-form gauge fields so that it has a local 1-form symmetry, with the 2-form gauge fields given in terms of the 2-form current densities associated with the Dirac strings. The field equations of Dirac's theory do not depend on the positions of the Dirac strings provided that they do not intersect the worldlines of any electrically charged particles; this constraint is called the Dirac veto. It is shown that Dirac's action is independent of the positions of the Dirac strings and that this corresponds a local 1-form symmetry. The electric and magnetic 1-form symmetries have a mixed anomaly, and the Dirac veto is shown to correspond to a restriction to gauge transformations for which the anomaly vanishes. The extension to $p$-form gauge fields in d-dimensions coupled to charged branes is discussed, together with the possibility of cancelling the anomaly by embedding in a higher-dimensional theory and so avoiding the veto.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at $\theta =\pi$ from imaginary $\theta$ simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory at $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it is the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are available. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$ term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, where the sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$. We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to be used in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the topological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and provide an evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low temperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature. This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantizing Null p-branes: Light-Cone Gauge Analysis and Physical Hilbert Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study null $p$-branes, $p$-branes with a Carrollian $p+1$-dimensional worldvolume embedded in a generic $D$-dimensional flat Minkowski target space. This theory has a generalized BMS$_{p+1}$ gauge symmetry. By fixing the light-cone gauge, the BMS symmetry is partly fixed, leaving $p$ ``momentum constraints'' alongside $p$-dimensional area-preserving diffeomorphisms. We quantize the theory in the light-cone gauge via canonical quantization and construct the physical Hilbert space by imposing the remaining constraints using sandwich conditions: the constraints must vanish when sandwiched between any two physical states. We show that solutions to the sandwich conditions are classified into $p+1$ distinct classes, which we completely specify. In addition, we discuss special and interesting case of membranes in four dimensions and examine the physical implications of the quantized null $p$-brane and its associated physical Hilbert space.</description>

Abstract: In general the speed of Gravitational Waves (GWs) in Scalar-Tensor modifications of Einstein's gravity is different from the speed of Light. Nevertheless, it has been measured that their speeds are nearly the same. For the most general Scalar-Tensor theories classified to date that do propagate a graviton -- DHOST, {\it including Horndeski and Beyond Horndeski (BH) theories} -- we show that, remarkably, up to 5 self-consistent couplings of the scalar of Dark Energy (DE) to the Photon are enough to make their GWs luminal in a wide set of cases. We find at least one Luminal Beyond Horndeski theory for which the GW decay into Dark Energy is suppressed in any cosmological background.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the interaction between matter and causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) in the context of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We focus on the Ising model coupled to CDT, contrasting this with Liouville gravity and the relation to the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (KPZ) formula. We demonstrate analytically for the quenched model that the conformal dimensions of fields on CDT align with those on a fixed lattice. We do this using a combination of lattice methods and adapting the Duplantier-Sheffield framework to CDT, emphasizing the one-dimensional nature of CDT and its description via a stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Finite-coupling spectrum of O(N) model in AdS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimensions in the boundary $\mathsf{CFT}_{d}$ corresponding to the $\mathsf{O}(N)$ model in $\mathsf{EAdS}_{d+1}$. The $\mathsf{CFT}$ data accessible to the 4-point boundary correlator of fundamental fields are extracted in $d=2$ and $d=4$, at a finite coupling, and to the leading nontrivial order in the $1/N$ expansion. We focus on the non-singlet sectors, namely the anti-symmetric and symmetric traceless irreducible representations of the $\mathsf{O}(N)$ group, extending the previous results that considered only the singlet sector. Studying the non-singlet sector requires an understanding of the crossed-channel diagram contributions to the $s$-channel conformal block decomposition. Building upon an existing computation, we present general formulas in $d=2$ and $d=4$ for the contribution of a $t$-channel conformal block to the anomalous dimensions of $s$-channel double-twist operators, derived for external scalar operators with equal scaling dimensions. Up to some technical details, this eventually leads to the complete picture of $1/N$ corrections to the $\mathsf{CFT}$ data in the interacting theory.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$\textbf{$c$}$ CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

Abstract: Braneworlds inside an AdS black hole provide simple models where a closed cosmology can be encoded in a dual field theory. Previous studies have focused on pure-tension branes, where the only matter in the cosmology is that dual to the holographic bulk. We consider models with additional explicit matter fields on the brane. Both for perfect fluid matter and for an axion field on the brane, we show that this can avoid a self-intersection problem in the Euclidean construction of such geometries in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simple or "outermost" wedge in AdS is the portion of the entanglement wedge that can be reconstructed with sub-exponential effort from CFT data. Here we furnish a definition in arbitrary spacetimes: given an input wedge $a$ analogous to a CFT boundary region, the simple wedge $z(a)$ is the largest wedge accessible by a "zigzag," a certain sequence of antinormal lightsheets. We show that $z(a)$ is a throat, and that it is contained in every other throat. This implies that $z(a)$ is unique; that it is contained in the generalized entanglement wedge; and that it reduces to the AdS prescription as a special case.
  The zigzag explicitly constructs a preferred Cauchy slice that renders the simple wedge accessible from $a$; thus it adds a novel structure even in AdS. So far, no spacelike construction is known to reproduce these results, even in time-symmetric settings. This may have implications for the modeling of holographic encoding by tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Unified exact WKB framework for resonance -- Zel'dovich/complex-scaling regularization and rigged Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing quantum mechanical resonances using the exact WKB method. The non-perturbative formulation based on the exact WKB method works for incorporating the Zel'dovich regularization, the complex scaling method, and the rigged Hilbert space. While previous studies have demonstrated the exact WKB analysis in bound state problems, our work extends its application to quasi-stationary states. By examining the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, we illustrate how the exact WKB analysis captures resonant phenomena in a rigorous manner. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations \`a la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. Also, we find the most essential regulator of functional analyticity and construct a modified Hilbert space of the exact WKB framework for resonance, which is called the rigged Hilbert space. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact WKB methods in unstable quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents a possible attempt at renormalisable quantum gravity based on the standard BRST quantisation used for Yang-Mills theory. We have provided the BRST invariant Lagrangian of the gravitationally interacting U(1) gauge theory, namely the Quantum GraviElectro Dynamics (QGED), including the gauge fixing and the ghost Lagrangian. We have extracted a set of Feynman rules in the local inertial frame where gravity locally vanishes from this Lagrangian. Using the Feynman rules of the QGED constructed here, we have built all the renormalisation constants and show that the theory is perturbatively renormalisable, at least in the one-loop order. Power counting suggests that our theory could be renormalised in all orders of perturbative expansion. All infinite naked objects in the naked Lagrangian can replace experimentally measured ones. In addition to the standard QED parameters, we have shown that the gravitational coupling constant can be experimentally measured.
  We have also discussed a running effect of the gravitational coupling constant and the perturbative estimation of the Hawking radiation as examples of perturbative QGED. The difference between our theory and the widely known un-renormalisable quantum general relativity is clarified.</description>

Abstract: We present a mathematical proof of the Aganagic-Dijkgraaf-Klemm-Mari\~no-Vafa Conjecture proposed in 2006, which states that the generating function of the topological vertex, i.e., the generating function of the open Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{C}^3$, satisfies the $3$-component KP hierarchy. In our proof we introduce a boson-fermionic field assignment which generalizes the well-known boson-fermion correspondence. The proof also works for the generalization to the framed topological vertex case conjectured by Deng and Zhou. As a consequence, open Gromov-Witten theory of all smooth toric Calabi-Yau threefolds are controlled by the multi-component KP hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetry and Exotic Hall Conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate fractionalization of non-invertible symmetry in (2+1)D topological orders. We focus on coset non-invertible symmetries obtained by gauging non-normal subgroups of invertible $0$-form symmetries. These symmetries can arise as global symmetries in quantum spin liquids, given by the quotient of the projective symmetry group by a non-normal subgroup as invariant gauge group. We point out that such coset non-invertible symmetries in topological orders can exhibit symmetry fractionalization: each anyon can carry a "fractional charge" under the coset non-invertible symmetry given by a gauge invariant superposition of fractional quantum numbers. We present various examples using field theories and quantum double lattice models, such as fractional quantum Hall systems with charge conjugation symmetry gauged and finite group gauge theory from gauging a non-normal subgroup. They include symmetry enriched $S_3$ and $O(2)$ gauge theories. We show that such systems have a fractionalized continuous non-invertible coset symmetry and a well-defined electric Hall conductance. The coset symmetry enforces a gapless edge state if the boundary preserves the continuous non-invertible symmetry. We propose a general approach for constructing coset symmetry defects using a "sandwich" construction: non-invertible symmetry defects can generally be constructed from an invertible defect sandwiched by condensation defects. The anomaly free condition for finite coset symmetry is also identified.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence from complex saddle points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum decoherence is the effect that bridges quantum physics to well-understood classical physics. As such, it plays a crucial role in understanding the mysterious nature of quantum physics. Quantum decoherence is also a source of quantum noise that has to be well under control in quantum computing and in various experiments based on quantum technologies. Here we point out that quantum decoherence can be captured by $\textit{complex}$ saddle points in the Feynman path integral in much the same way as quantum tunneling can be captured by instantons. In particular, we present some first-principle calculations in the Caldeira-Leggett model, which reproduce the predicted scaling behavior of quantum decoherence with respect to the parameters of the environment, such as the temperature and the coupling to the system of interest. We also discuss how to extend our approach to general models by Monte Carlo calculations using a recently developed method to overcome the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the computational aspects of detecting topological order in a quantum many-body system. We contrast the widely used topological entanglement entropy with a recently introduced operational definition for topological order based on error correction properties, finding exponential scaling with the system size for the former and polynomial scaling for the latter. We exemplify our approach for a variant of the paradigmatic toric code model with mobile particles, finding that the error correction method allows to treat substantially larger system sizes. In particular, the phase diagram of the model can be successfully computed using error correction, while the topological entanglement entropy is too severely limited by finite size effects to obtain conclusive results. While we mainly focus on one-dimensional systems whose ground states can be expressed in terms of matrix product states, our strategy can be readily generalized to higher dimensions and systems out of equilibrium, even allowing for an efficient detection of topological order in current quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

      <title>How does non-metricity affect particle creation and evaporation in bumblebee gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the impact of non-metricity on particle creation and the evaporation process of black holes within the framework of bumblebee gravity. In general lines, we compare black holes in the metric formalism [1] and the metric-affine approach [2]. Initially, we focus on bosonic particle modes to investigate Hawking radiation. Using the Klein-Gordon equation, we compute the Bogoliubov coefficients and derive the Hawking temperature. Subsequently, we examine Hawking radiation as a tunneling process, resolving divergent integrals through the residue method. The analysis is then extended to fermionic particle modes, also within the tunneling framework. Particle creation densities are calculated for both bosonic and fermionic cases. Additionally, greybody bounds are estimated for bosonic and fermionic particles. Furthermore, we explore the evaporation process, considering the final state of the black holes and we also investigate the correlation between the greybody factors and the quasinormal modes. Finally, constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameters $\ell$ (for the metric case) and $X$ (for the metric-affine case) are established using recent astrophysical data on black hole lifetimes. In a general panorama, non-metricity (except for the tensor perturbations) in bumblebee gravity raises particle density for bosons while reducing it for fermions, increases greybody factors (for both bosons and fermions), amplifies the emission rate, and accelerates the evaporation process.</description>

      <title>Acceleration-induced radiation from a qudit particle detector model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We nonperturbatively examine the emission rate of acceleration-induced radiation from a uniformly accelerated gapless qudit-type Unruh-DeWitt detector. We find that the emission rate can be written as Larmor's formula multiplied by a factor that depends on the detector's initial state. In particular, certain initial states of integer-spin detectors do not produce radiation. Although the appearance of Larmor's formula may suggest a classical phenomenon, we argue that the resulting radiation is fundamentally distinct from that of structureless classical sources, as it evolves into a multimode coherent state correlated with the detector's internal degree of freedom. Thus, gapless detectors cannot be treated as structureless sources, as previously proposed.</description>

      <title>Causality constraints on radiative transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard formula, due to Spiegel, for the smoothing of temperature fluctuations by radiative transfer is unstable in relativity. This is due to the fact that Spiegel neglected the transit time of light, thereby allowing the transport coefficients to move outside the convex geometry compatible with causality (the "hydrohedron"). Here, we fix this pathology. First, we prove that the linearized radiative transfer equations are causal and covariantly stable by construction. Then, we repeat Spiegel's calculation accounting for the finite speed of photons. We find that the full transfer problem can be solved analytically. All the infinite (exact) transport coefficients arising from it fall inside the hydrohedron. Our analysis also accounts for isotropic scattering.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. In particular, it admits a good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form. Our key idea is to use Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties.
  For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertion -- namely, the existence of a canonical (local) torus action -- assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)Kahler metrics. Conversely, our results can be also used to study local behaviour of such metrics around the germ. For instance, we show that such singular hyperKahler metric around isolated singularity is close to a metric cone in a polynomial order, and satisfies $r=1$ i.e., has a good canonical (local) $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, as the complexification of the cone metric rescaling. Our theory also fits well to singularities on many hyperKahler reductions.</description>

      <title>Geodesic dynamics in brane-de Sitter wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a dynamical analysis of the null and timelike geodesics around an asymptotically de Sitter wormhole in a Randall-Sundrum brane. In this framework, the wormhole throat is interpreted both as a photon sphere and as a fixed point of the associated dynamical system. The stability of this structure is evaluated using Lyapunov and Jacobi criteria with consistent results. A Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation is observed in the null-geodesic dynamics, highlighting critical changes in the behavior of light around the wormhole. Explicit solutions are derived for geodesics near the throat, providing insight into the optical appearance of the wormhole shadow. These results show qualitatively similar behavior for null and timelike orbits, suggesting universal features of geodesic dynamics in brane-de Sitter wormholes.</description>

Abstract: We show that the latest empirical constraints on cosmology, from a combination of DESI, CMB and supernova data, can be accounted for if a small component of dark matter has an evolving and oscillating equation of state within $-1&lt;w&lt;1$. From a fundamental physics perspective, this interpretation is more appealing than an evolving phantom dark energy with $w&lt;-1$, which violates the null energy condition.</description>

      <title>Deep learning spinfoam vertex amplitudes: the Euclidean Barrett-Crane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spinfoam theories propose a well-defined path-integral formulation for quantum gravity and are hoped to provide the dynamics of loop quantum gravity. However, it is computationally hard to calculate spinfoam amplitudes. The well-studied Euclidean Barrett-Crane model provides an excellent setting for testing analytical and numerical tools to probe spinfoam models. We explore a data-driven approach to accelerating spinfoam computations by showing that the vertex amplitude is an object that can be learned from data using deep learning. We divide the learning process into a classification and a regression task: Two networks are independently engineered to decide whether the amplitude is zero or not and to predict the precise numerical value, respectively. The trained networks are tested with several accuracy measures. The classifier in particular demonstrates robust generalisation far outside the training domain, while the regressor demonstrates high predictive accuracy in the domain it is trained on. We discuss limitations, possible improvements, and implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Hot Holographic 2-flavor Quark Star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark-gluon plasma around the critical point at $T=182$ MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.15. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. Besides, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>
