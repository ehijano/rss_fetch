      <title>General Chen-Ricci inequalities for Riemannian submersions and Riemannian maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive general forms of the Chen-Ricci inequalities for Riemannian submersions between Riemannian manifolds. We also derive general forms of the Chen-Ricci and improved Chen-Ricci inequalities for Riemannian maps between Riemannian manifolds, involving the relations between curvatures of subspaces of source and target spaces. These general forms give new techniques that are easy, elegant, and fruitful to obtain the Chen-Ricci inequalities for such smooth mappings with various space forms. As applications, utilizing these general forms, we explicitly establish Chen-Ricci inequalities when the source manifolds of Riemannian submersions and the target manifolds of Riemannian maps belong to broader classes, such as generalized complex and generalized Sasakian space forms, particularly including real, complex, real K\"ahler, Sasakian, Kenmotsu, cosymplectic, and $C(\alpha)$ space forms. Furthermore, we provide Chen-Ricci inequalities for various types of geometrically structured Riemannian submersions and Riemannian maps, such as invariant, anti-invariant, semi-invariant, slant, semi-slant, and hemi-slant. In particular, imposing suitable circumstances towards validation, our inequalities become the same as various known inequalities established by many authors in [1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 22, 23, 29, 48, 49].</description>

      <title>Uniqueness in the Plateau problem near Quadratic cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider minimal hypersurfaces inside the unit ball whose boundary on the sphere is a small perturbation of the link of a minimizing quadratic cone. We show that such minimal surfaces are uniquely determined by their boundary condition. In particular the solutions of the Plateau problem are unique for boundary conditions given by small perturbations of the link of a quadratic cone.</description>

      <title>On the classification of Jacobi curves and their conformal curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the theory of Jacobi curves, a far reaching extension of the spaces of Jacobi fields along Riemannian geodesics, developed by Agrachev and Zelenko. Jacobi curves are curves in the Lagrangian Grassmannian of a symplectic space satisfying appropriate regularity conditions. It is shown that they are fully characterised in terms of a family of conformal symplectic invariant curvatures. In addition to a new derivation of the Ricci curvature tensor of a Jacobi curve, a Cartan-like theory of Jacobi curves is presented that allows to associate to any admissible Jacobi curve a reduced normal Cartan matrix. A reconstruction theorem proving that an admissible Jacobi curve is characterised, up to conformal symplectic transformations, by a reduced normal Cartan matrix and a geometric parametrization is obtained. The theory of cycles is studied proving that they correspond to flat Jacobi curves.</description>

      <title>On Markowitz's pseudodistance for conformal manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1980s, M. J. Markowitz introduced a conformally invariant pseudodistance on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, inspired by the Kobayashi metric in projective geometry. This construction relies on a distinguished class of parametrized lightlike geodesics, called projectively parametrized. We begin by reviewing the fundamental properties of this pseudodistance and provide several families of examples where it is non-degenerate and, in some cases, complete. In particular, we investigate three classes of manifolds: closed manifolds, conformally convex domains of the Einstein universe, and globally hyperbolic, conformally flat, $C$-maximal spacetimes. For the first two classes, we obtain results analogous to those of Brody and Barth concerning the complex Kobayashi metric. Finally, we apply Markowitz's pseudodistance to classify all quasi-homogeneous domains of the Einstein-de Sitter space, that is, a half-space of Minkowski space bounded by a spacelike hyperplane. Up to conformal transformations, only finitely many such domains exist, and all of them turn out to be homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Projective geodesic extensions by conformal modifications in nonholonomic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projective geodesic extensions are reparametrizations of the trajectories of a nonholonomic mechanical system (with only a kinetic energy Lagrangian), in such a way that they can be interpreted as part of the geodesics of a Riemannian metric. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these extensions, in the case where the constrained Lagrangian remains preserved up to a conformal transformation. When the nonholonomic system has a symmetry group (a Chaplygin system), we clarify the relation between projective geodesic extensions and closely related concepts, such as ${\phi}$-simplicity, invariant measures and Hamiltonization. Throughout the paper, new and relevant examples illustrate the key differences between all these concepts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GJMS operators, introduced by Graham, Jenne, Mason, and Sparling, are a family of conformally invariant linear differential operators with leading term a power of the Laplacian. These operators and their method of construction have had a major impact in geometry, analysis, and physics. We describe the GJMS operators and their construction, and briefly survey their importance and impact.</description>

      <title>Spin(7)-Orbifold Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general analytic and geometric framework for resolving Spin(7)--orbifolds. These spaces arise naturally as boundary points in the moduli space of exceptional holonomy metrics, and smooth Gromov--Hausdorff resolutions can be viewed as paths from the boundary to the interior of the moduli space. Our construction combines algebraic and symplectic techniques with analytic gluing methods: singular strata are replaced by families of adiabatic torsion--free, asymptotically conical fibred spaces, whose existence is controlled by the analysis of Dirac--type operators on orbifold resolutions. We formulate obstruction conditions in terms of string cohomology, prove existence results for torsion--free Spin(7)--structures extending Joyce's theorem arXiv:math/9910002 to the setting of orbifold resolutions, and construct new families of compact Spin(7)--manifolds. By dimensional reduction, our results also recover, generalise and extend the results of Joyce and Karigiannis arXiv:1707.09325 on $G_2$--orbifold resolutions. This unifies and extends all known resolution methods for exceptional holonomy orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Spaces with Rectangular Unit Lattices, Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a theorem of Loos stating that a Riemannian symmetric space X with rectangular unit lattice is a symmetric R-space. For this we construct explicitly an isometric extrinsically symmetric embedding of X in a Euclidean space which reveals X as a standardly embedded symmetric R-space. We further determine the root systems, Euclidean root data, fundamental groups and eigenvalues of the Laplacian of symmetric spaces with rectangular unit lattice in a direct way.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing invariants in $G$-equivariant birational geometry by unifying two recent approaches: the \emph{theory of atoms} recently developed by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, and the theory of \emph{modular symbols} due to Kontsevich, Tschinkel, and Pestun.
  We initiate the theory of Chen-Ruan atoms. Assuming the blowup formula for the quantum Chen-Ruan cohomology, we outline how to extend the theory of atoms to global quotient orbifolds and present some striking applications.
  In addition, we develop a separate class of purely geometric invariants for $\mathbb{Z}/2$- and $\mathbb{Z}/3$-actions on surfaces and threefolds.
  We provide many examples of non-$G$-linearizable $G$-actions on projective varieties treated with these new techniques.</description>

      <title>Singularities of Ricci flow and diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06240v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparing and recognizing metrics can be extraordinarily difficult because of the group of diffeomorphisms. Two metrics, that could even be the same, could look completely different in different coordinates. This is the gauge problem. The general gauge problem is extremely subtle for non-compact spaces. Often it can be avoided if one uses some additional structure of the particular situation. However, in many problems there is no additional structure. Instead we solve the gauge problem directly in great generality.
  The techniques and ideas apply to many problems. We use them to solve a well-known open problem in Ricci flow: Strong rigidity of cylinders. Strong rigidity is an illustration of a {\it shrinker principle} that uniqueness radiates out from a compact set. It implies that if one tangent flow at a future singular point is a cylinder, then all tangent flows are.
  We solve the gauge problem by solving a nonlinear system of PDEs. The PDE produces a diffeomorphism that fixes an appropriate gauge in the spirit of the slice theorem for group actions. We then show optimal bounds for the displacement function of the diffeomorphism. Strong rigidity relies on gauge fixing and several other new ideas. One of these is "propagation of almost splitting", another is quadratic rigidity in the right gauge, and a third is an optimal polynomial growth bound for PDEs that holds in great generality.</description>

      <title>Higher order obstructions to Riccati-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new techniques in order to deal with Riccati-type equations, subject to a further algebraic constraint, on Riemannian manifolds $(M^3,g)$. We find that the obstruction to solve the aforementioned equation has order $4$ in the metric coefficients and is fully described by an homogeneous polynomial in $\mathrm{Sym}^{16}TM$. Techniques from real algebraic geometry, reminiscent of those used for the "PositiveStellen-Satz " problem, allow determining the geometry in terms of the connection coefficients and a class of Hessian-type equations. Analysis of the latter shows flatness for the metric $g$; in particular we complete the classification of asymptotically harmonic manifolds of dimension $3$, establishing those are either flat or real hyperbolic spaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to a kind of rearrangement of functions on CD(k,n)-spaces, which satisfy a Polya-Szeg\"o type inequality. We use this rearrangement to prove the validity of a Moser-Trudinger type inequality on a wide class of metric measure spaces satisfying a CD(k,n)-curvature-dimension inequality. As a consequence, we give a characterization, among manifolds with lower bounded Ricci curvature, of those admitting a Moser-Trudinger type inequality.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Cheeger-Gromov convergence and temporal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniqueness (up to isometries) and existence of limits are analyzed in the context of Cheeger-Gromov convergence of spacetimes. To face the non-compactness of the vector isometry group in the semi-Riemannian setting, standard pointed convergence is strengthened to anchored convergence (which requires the convergence of a timelike direction in the Lorentzian case). Then, a local isometry between the neighborhoods of the basepoints is found, and extended globally under geodesic completeness of just inextensibility. In spacetimes, by using Cauchy temporal functions as both strengthenings of the anchor and tools to ''Wick rotate'' metrics, a new notion of convergence for globally hyperbolic spacetimes (including the case of timelike boundaries) is introduced. The machinery of Riemannian Cheeger-Gromov theory becomes applicable after revisiting the tools related to time functions and studying their connections with Sormani--Vega null distance. In particular, several results with interest on their own right are obtained such as: time functions are locally Lipschitz up to rescaling, global and local characterizations of $h$-steep functions, independence of steepness and $h$-steepness for temporal functions, compatibility of both conditions for Cauchy temporal functions, and the stability of the latter.</description>

Abstract: Given a smooth open oriented surface $X$ endowed with a family of complex structures $\{J_b\}_{b\in B}$ of some H\"older class and depending continuously or smoothly on the parameter $b$ in a suitable topological space $B$, we construct continuous or smooth families $F_b:X\to Y$, $b\in B$, of $J_b$-holomorphic maps to any Oka manifold $Y$, with approximation on a suitable family of compact Runge sets in $X$. Along the way, we prove Runge and Mergelyan approximation theorems and Weierstrass interpolation theorem for functions on such families. We include applications to the construction of families of directed holomorphic immersions and conformal minimal immersions to Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Compactness and non-compactness theorems of the fourth- and sixth-order constant $Q$-curvature problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete resolution to the question of compactness for the full solution sets of the fourth-order and sixth-order constant $Q$-curvature problems on smooth closed Riemannian manifolds not conformally diffeomorphic to the standard unit $n$-sphere, provided the associated conformally covariant differential operator has a positive Green's function.
  Firstly, we prove that the solution set of the fourth-order constant $Q$-curvature problem is $C^4$-compact in dimensions $5 \le n \le 24$. For $n \ge 25$, an example of an $L^{\infty}$-unbounded sequence of solutions has been known for over a decade (Wei and Zhao). Additionally, the compactness result for $5 \le n \le 9$ was established by Li and Xiong.
  Secondly, we demonstrate that the solution set of the sixth-order constant $Q$-curvature problem is $C^6$-compact in dimensions $7 \le n \le 26$, whereas a blow-up example exists for $n \ge 27$.
  Our main observation is that the linearized equations associated with both $Q$-curvature problems can be transformed into overdetermined linear systems, which admit nontrivial solutions due to unexpected algebraic structures of the Paneitz operator and the sixth-order GJMS operator. This key insight not only plays a crucial role in deducing the compactness result for high-dimensional manifolds, but also reveals an elegant hierarchical pattern with respect to the order of the conformally covariant operators, suggesting the possibility of a unified theory of the compactness of the constant $Q$-curvature problems of all admissible even integer orders.</description>

      <title>Locally homogeneous Axiom A flows II: geometric structures for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a non-compact semisimple real Lie group $G$ and an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$, we utilize the correspondence between $\mathbb R$-valued additive characters on Levi subgroups $L$ of $G$ and $\mathbb R$-affine homogeneous line bundles over $G/L$ to systematically construct families of non-empty domains of proper discontinuity for the $\Gamma$-action. If $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, the analytic dynamical systems on the quotients are Axiom A, and assemble into a single partially hyperbolic multiflow. Each Axiom A system admits global analytic stable/unstable foliations with non-wandering set a single basic set on which the flow is conjugate to Sambarino's refraction flow, establishing that all refraction flows arise in this fashion. Furthermore, the $\mathbb R$-valued additive character is regular if and only if the associated Axiom A system admits a compatible pseudo-Riemannian metric and contact structure, which we relate to the Poisson structure on the dual of the Lie algebra of $G$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of higher rank via affine maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Hadamard spaces with geometric group actions admit affine maps that are not dilations, if and only if they are Riemannian symmetric spaces of higher rank, Euclidean buildings of higher rank, or split as non-trivial metric products.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons potentials of higher-dimensional Pontryagin densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the $(2n-1)$-form Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density, i.e. the $n^{\text{th}}$ Chern character, in arbitrary even dimensions $D=2 n \geq 2$. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general, and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Chern characters and hence Pontryagin densities. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>Asymptotia of Kerr-de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exterior geometries of physical black holes are believed to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter spacetime at late times. A characteristic feature of that vacuum Einstein solution is the presence of a hidden symmetry generated by a closed conformal Killing--Yano tensor. Using this symmetry and modern conformal geometry technology, we find necessary conditions for generic solutions to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter metric. Further, we constrain the admissible form of the geometric free data on the conformal infinity giving rise to this family of spacetimes and constrain it in terms of the stress-energy tensor.</description>
