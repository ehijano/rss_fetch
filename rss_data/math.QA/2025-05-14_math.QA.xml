      <title>Homomorphism Indistinguishability Relations induced by Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homomorphism indistinguishability is a way of characterising many natural equivalence relations on graphs. Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are called homomorphism indistinguishable over a graph class $\mathcal{F}$ if for each $F \in \mathcal{F}$, the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$ equals the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $H$. Examples of such equivalence relations include isomorphism and cospectrality, as well as equivalence with respect to many formal logics. Quantum groups are a generalisation of topological groups that describe "non-commutative symmetries" and, inter alia, have applications in quantum information theory. An important subclass are the easy quantum groups, which enjoy a combinatorial characterisation and have been fully classified by Raum and Weber. A recent connection between these seemingly distant concepts was made by Man\v{c}inska and Roberson, who showed that quantum isomorphism, a relaxation of classical isomorphism that can be phrased in terms of the quantum symmetric group, is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over the class of planar graphs. We generalise Man\v{c}inska and Roberson's result to all orthogonal easy quantum groups. We obtain for each orthogonal easy quantum group a graph isomorphism relaxation $\approx$ and a graph class $\mathcal{F}$, such that homomorphism indistinguishability over $\mathcal{F}$ coincides with $\approx$. Our results include a full classification of the $(0, 0)$-intertwiners of the graph-theoretic quantum group obtained by adding the adjacency matrix of a graph to the intertwiners of an orthogonal easy quantum group.</description>

      <title>$C^\ast$-categorical prefactorization algebras for superselection sectors and topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under certain assumptions which are implied by Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^1\times\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\mathbb{R}^1\times(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\setminus\mathrm{pt}) \cong\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors.</description>

      <title>Equivalences of racks, Legendrian racks, and symmetric racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Racks and Legendrian racks are nonassociative algebraic structures based on the framed and Legendrian Reidemeister moves, respectively. Motivated by the classification problem for Legendrian knots, we construct an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks (and, hence, GL-quandles). We deduce equivalences between kink-involutory racks and Legendrian quandles, involutory racks and Legendrian kei, and the respective pairs of full subcategories whose objects are medial.
  As applications, we classify objects in these categories up to order 8 and classify several families of symmetric racks; these results are likely to be of independent interest. In particular, the categories of kei with good involutions, Legendrian kei, and involutory racks are all equivalent.</description>

      <title>The Links-Gould invariant as a classical generalization of the Alexander polynomial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we conjecture that the Links-Gould invariant of links, that we know is a generalization of the Alexander-Conway polynomial, shares some of its classical features. In particular it seems to give a lower bound for the genus of links and to provide a criterion for fiberedness of knots. We give some evidence for these two assumptions.</description>

      <title>A new bijective proof of the $q$-Pfaff--Saalsch\"utz identity with applications to quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a bijective proof of a family of $q$-binomial identities -- including Stanley's identity -- each equivalent to the $q$-Pfaff--Saalsch\"utz identity. Our proof is far shorter than those previously known and is the first in which $q$-binomial coefficients are interpreted as counting subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_q$-vector spaces. As a corollary, we obtain a new multiplication rule for quantum binomial coefficients and hence a new presentation of Lusztig's integral form $U_{\mathbb{Z}[q, q^{-1}]}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ of the Cartan subalgebra of the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of integrable modules over $\imath$quantum groups (a.k.a. quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebras). After determining a presentation of such modules, we prove that each integrable module over a quantum group is integrable when restricted to an $\imath$quantum group. As an application, we show that the space of matrix coefficients of all simple integrable modules over an $\imath$quantum group of finite type with specific parameters coincides with Bao-Song's coordinate ring of the $\imath$quantum group.</description>

      <title>Symplectic tableaux and quantum symmetric pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new branching rule from the general linear group $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to the symplectic group $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ by establishing a simple algorithm which gives rise to a bijection from the set of semistandard tableaux of a fixed shape to a disjoint union of several copies of sets of symplectic tableaux of various shapes. The algorithm arises from representation theory of a quantum symmetric pair of type $A\mathrm{II}_{2n-1}$, which is a $q$-analogue of the classical symmetric pair $(\mathfrak{gl}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}), \mathfrak{sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}))$.</description>

      <title>Torsion elements in the associated graded of the $Y$-filtration of the monoid of homology cylinders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clasper surgery induces the $Y$-filtration $\{Y_n\mathcal{IC}\}_n$ over the monoid of homology cylinders, which serves as a $3$-dimensional analogue of the lower central series of the Torelli group of a surface. In this paper, we investigate the torsion submodules of the associated graded modules of these filtrations. To detect torsion elements, we introduce a homomorphism on $Y_n\mathcal{IC}/Y_{n+1}$ induced by the degree $n+2$ part of the LMO functor. Additionally, we provide a formula that computes this homomorphism under clasper surgery, and use it to demonstrate that every non-trivial torsion element in $Y_6\mathcal{IC}/Y_7$ has order $3$.</description>

      <title>Hopf braces and semi-abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopf braces have been introduced as a Hopf-theoretic generalization of skew braces. Under the assumption of cocommutativity, these algebraic structures are equivalent to matched pairs of actions on Hopf algebras, that can be used to produce solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We prove that the category of cocommutative Hopf braces is semi-abelian and strongly protomodular. In particular, this implies that the main homological lemmas known for groups, Lie algebras and other classical algebraic structures also hold for cocommutative Hopf braces. Abelian objects are commutative and cocommutative Hopf algebras, that form an abelian Birkhoff subcategory of the category of cocommutative Hopf braces. Moreover, we show that the full subcategories of "primitive Hopf braces" and of "skew braces" form an hereditary torsion theory in the category of cocommutative Hopf braces, and that "skew braces" are also a Birkhoff subcategory and a localization of the latter category. Finally, we describe central extensions and commutators for cocommutative Hopf braces.</description>
