      <title>Impacts and Ejecta in Natural Granular Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With laboratory experiments we investigate the ejecta of low-velocity (~m/s) impacts into multi-scale granular media and compare them against ejecta from impacts into mono-scale media. Impacts are into a 50 cm diameter galvanized washtub filled with fine sand that has larger diameter gravel buried below the surface is filmed with two high-speed cameras. The resulting ejecta curtain consists mainly of fine sand, and has a complex asymmetric structure that depends on the location and interaction of the ejecta with the larger gravel grains mixed into the sand. To characterize the highly heterogeneous ejecta curtain we combine three analysis techniques: Particle tracking measures the ejecta velocities and ejecta angles best in low density regions, while particle image velocimetry (PIV) elucidates average motion in dense regions, and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) which captures directions of motion against a patterned background. We find significant asymmetries in the multi-scale ejecta's velocity distributions and ejection angles compared to the symmetry seen in the ejecta from impacts into mono-scale media. Our experiments show that larger grains under the surface impede and direct ejecta along preferential paths during the impact process.</description>

      <title>A Proliferating Nematic That Collectively Senses an Anisotropic Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on growing fibroblasts, we examine the development of nematic order in a colony of elongated cells proliferating on a nematic elastomer substrate. After sparse seeding, the cells divide and grow into locally ordered, but randomly oriented, domains that then interact with each other and the substrate. Global alignment with the substrate is only achieved above a critical density, suggesting a collective mechanism for the sensing of substrate anisotropy. The system jams at high density, where both reorientation and proliferation stop. Using a continuum model of a proliferating nematic liquid crystal, we examine the competition between growth-driven alignment and substrate-driven alignment in controlling the density and structure of the final jammed state. We propose that anisotropic traction forces and the tendency of cells to align perpendicular to the direction of density gradients act in concert to provide a mechanism for collective cell alignment.</description>

      <title>Intermediate scattering function of colloids in a periodic laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of individual colloidal particles in a one-dimensional periodic potential using the intermediate scattering function (ISF) as a key observable. We elaborate a theoretical framework and derive formally exact analytical expressions for the ISF. We introduce and analyze a generalized ISF with two wave vectors to capture correlations in a periodic potential beyond the standard ISF. Relying on Bloch's theorem for periodic systems and, by solving the Smoluchowski equation for an overdamped Brownian particle in a cosine potential, we evaluate the ISF by numerically solving for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the expression. We apply time-dependent perturbation theory to expand the ISF and extract low-order moments, including the mean-square displacement, the time-dependent diffusivity, and the non-Gaussian parameter. Our analytical results are validated through Brownian-dynamics simulations and experiments on 2D colloidal systems exposed to a light-induced periodic potential generated by two interacting laser beams.</description>

      <title>Steady-state extensional viscosity of wormlike micellar solutions via dissipative particle dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state extensional viscosity of wormlike micellar solutions using dissipative particle dynamics simulations. As the extension rate increases, the steady-state extensional viscosity initially increases and subsequently decreases after reaching a maximum, as observed in experiments. We reveal that this nonmonotonic behavior arises from the competition between micellar stretching and scission under uniaxial extensional flow. We further propose a relation that connects the extensional viscosity to micellar structures and kinetics. This relation provides a unified description of the extensional viscosity of unentangled wormlike micellar solutions for various temperatures, concentrations, and extension rates.</description>

      <title>Configurational forces explain echelon cracks in soft materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft fracture in highly deformable solids involves both geometric and constitutive nonlinearities, necessitating advanced theoretical and computational frameworks for its accurate understanding. Tensile fractures subjected to mixed-mode loading deviate from their original planar shape, resulting in echelon crack patterns. When out-of-plane shear is superimposed, a crack front segments into an array of tilted facets. The physical interpretation of echelon cracks is only marginally understood, and it is customarily based on rather limited approaches based on Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics. Here we investigate mixed-mode I + III fracture within the framework of configurational mechanics. Using the Configurational Force Method, implemented as a post-processing algorithm in a finite-element-based simulation, we compute the configurational forces acting at the crack tip of model fracture geometries prior to propagation. Configurational forces characterize both the magnitude and direction of propagation for maximal energy release rate. Our results reveal the complex interactions between tilted facets and their critical role in shaping the fracture morphology. We also examine the effects of facet coalescence-driven by the growth of the parent crack-where neighboring facets merge into a unified crack front. These findings provide new insights into fracture processes in soft, quasi-brittle materials under mixed-mode loading.</description>

      <title>When $B_2$ is Not Enough: Evaluating Simple Metrics for Predicting Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12312v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological processes. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex dependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the propensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific metrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second virial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure density. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this data to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive performance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective strengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a broadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and accuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across both phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this metric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties for IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond binary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior or predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.</description>

      <title>Velocity Distribution and Diffusion of an Athermal Inertial Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Shear-Thickening Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an athermal inertial run-and-tumble particle moving in a shear-thickening medium in $d=1$. The viscosity of the medium is represented by a nonlinear function $f(v)\sim\tan(v)$, while a symmetric dichotomous noise of strength $\Sigma$ and flipping rate $\lambda$ models the activity of the particle. Starting from the Fokker-Planck~(FP) equation for the time-dependent probability distribution $W_{\pm\Sigma}(v, t)$ of the particle's velocity $v$ at time $t$ and the active force is $\pm\Sigma$, we analytically derive the steady-state velocity distribution function $W_s(v)$ and a quadrature expression for the effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm eff}$. For a fixed $\Sigma$, $W_s(v)$ undergoes multiple transitions with varying $\lambda$, and we have identified the corresponding transition points. We then numerically compute $W_s(v)$, the mean-squared velocity $\langle v^2\rangle(t)$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm eff}$, all of which show excellent agreement with the analytical results in the steady-state. Finally, we test the robustness of the transitions in $W_s(v)$ by considering an alternative $f(v)$ function that also capture the shear-thickening behavior of the medium.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Number of Stable Configurations for the Generalized Thomson Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:1504.00637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a natural number N, one may ask what configuration of N points on the two-sphere minimizes the discrete generalized Coulomb energy. If one applies a gradient-based numerical optimization to this problem, one encounters many configurations that are stable but not globally minimal. This led the authors of this manuscript to the question, how many stable configurations are there? In this manuscript we report methods for identifying and counting observed stable configurations, and estimating the actual number of stable configurations. These estimates indicate that for N approaching two hundred, there are at least tens of thousands of stable configurations.</description>

      <title>A geometric condition for robot-swarm cohesion and cluster-flock transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometric design rule for size-controlled clustering of self-propelled particles. We show that active particles that tend to rotate under an external force have an intrinsic, signed parameter with units of curvature which we call curvity, that can be derived from first principles. Experiments with robots and numerical simulations show that properties of individual robots (radius and curvity) control pair cohesion in a binary system, and the stability of flocking and self-limiting clustering in a swarm, with applications in meta-materials and in embodied decentralized control.</description>

      <title>Granular segregation across flow geometries: a closure model for the particle segregation velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting particle segregation has remained challenging due to the lack of a general model for the segregation velocity that is applicable across a range of granular flow geometries. Here, a segregation velocity model for dense granular flows is developed by exploiting momentum balance and recent advances in particle-scale modelling of the segregation driving and drag forces over a wide range of particle concentrations, size and density ratios, and flow conditions. This model is shown to correctly predict particle segregation velocity in a diverse set of idealized and natural granular flow geometries simulated using the discrete element method. When incorporated in the well-established advection-diffusion-segregation formulation, the model has the potential to accurately capture segregation phenomena in many relevant industrial application and geophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Long-range order in two-dimensional systems with fluctuating active stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional tissues, such as developing germ layers, pair-wise forces (or active stresses) arise from the contractile activity of the cytoskeleton, with dissipation provided by the three-dimensional surroundings. We show analytically how these pair-wise stochastic forces, unlike the particle-wise independent fluctuating forces usually considered in active matter systems, produce conserved centre-of-mass dynamics and so are able to damp large-wavelength displacement fluctuations in elastic systems. A consequence of this is the stabilisation of long-range translational order in two dimensions, in clear violation of the celebrated Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the emergence of hyperuniformity with a structure factor $S(q) \sim q^2$ in the $q \to 0$ limit. We then introduce two numerical cell tissue models which feature these pair-wise active forces. First a vertex model, in which the cell tissue is represented by a tiling of polygons where the edges represent cell junctions and with activity provided by stochastic junctional contractions. Second an active disk model, derived from active Brownian particles, but with pairs of equal and opposite stochastic forces between particles. We study the melting transition of these models and find a first-order phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase in the disk model with active stresses. We confirm our analytical prediction of long-range order in both numerical models and show that hyperuniformity survives in the disordered phase, thus constituting a hidden order in our model tissue. Owing to the generality of this mechanism, we expect our results to be testable in living organisms, and to also apply to artificial systems with the same symmetry.</description>

      <title>Twist, splay, and uniform domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The newly-discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal exhibits a variety of unique defect phenomena. The depolarization field in the material favors spontaneous spatial variations in polarization, manifesting in diverse forms such as bulk twists and arrangements of alternating polarization domains. The configuration of these domains is governed by a balance between depolarization field reduction and molecular alignment at interfaces. We investigate a ferroelectric nematic confined in a thin cell with apolar surface anchoring, patterned using photoalignment. Under uniform planar alignment, the system forms stripes, while a radial +1 defect pattern results in pie-slice domains. Neighboring domains show either opposite directions of uniform polarization (thin cells) or opposite handedness of the spontaneous twist (thick cells). Our calculations and experiments demonstrate that electrostatic interactions tend to shrink domain size, whereas elastic and surface anchoring effects promote larger domains. In this work, we make predictions and measurements of the domain size as a function of cell thickness, and show that ionic screening suppresses domain formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear dynamics governing the breakup of a two-dimensional strip of active chiral fluid, finding that the strip thickness goes to zero at the pinch points as a power law in finite time. Using slender body theory combined with a scaling analysis, we predict new anomalous scaling exponents and functions characterizing the speed and shape of breakup. The scaling analysis is shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic equations.</description>
