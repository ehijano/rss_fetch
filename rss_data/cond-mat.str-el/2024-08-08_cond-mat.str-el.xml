      <title>Fractionalization as an alternate to charge ordering in electronic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incompressible insulating phases of electronic systems at partial filling of a lattice are often associated with charge ordering that breaks lattice symmetry. The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective integer filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which we dub "Quantum Charge Liquids" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that preserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either have gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order or have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on gapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological order. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is consistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational fillings $\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state degeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that of the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical systems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of these phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin liquid from electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is an exotic insulating phase with emergent gauge fields and fractionalized excitations. However, the unambiguous demonstration of the existence of a QSL in a "non-engineered" microscopic model (or in any material) remains challenging. Here, using numerically-exact sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a QSL arises in a non-engineered electron-phonon model. Specifically, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a 2D triangular lattice at half filling (one electron per site) which we show includes a QSL phase which is fully gapped, exhibits no symmetry-breaking order, and supports deconfined fractionalized holon excitations. This suggests new routes for finding QSLs in realistic materials and high-$T_c$ superconductivity by lightly doping them.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Kitaev's honeycomb model from braided fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion surface models, as introduced by Inamura and Ohmori, extend the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, taking fusion 2-categories as their input. In this work, we construct and analyze fusion surface models on the honeycomb lattice built from braided fusion 1-categories. These models preserve mutually commuting plaquette operators and anomalous 1-form symmetries. Their Hamiltonian is chosen to mimic the structure of Kitaev's honeycomb model, which is unitarily equivalent to the Ising fusion surface model. In the anisotropic limit, where one coupling constant is dominant, the fusion surface models reduce to Levin-Wen string-nets. In the isotropic limit, they are described by weakly coupled anyon chains and are likely to realize chiral topological order. We focus on three specific examples: (i) Kitaev's honeycomb model with a perturbation breaking time-reversal symmetry that realizes chiral Ising topological order, (ii) a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalization proposed by Barkeshli et al., which potentially realizes chiral parafermion topological order, and (iii) a novel Fibonacci honeycomb model featuring a non-invertible 1-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>Generalized Josephson effect with arbitrary periodicity in quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Easy-plane quantum magnets are strikingly similar to superconductors, allowing for spin supercurrent and an effective superconducting phase stemming from their $U(1)$ rotation symmetry around the $z$-axis. We uncover a generalized fractional Josephson effect with a periodicity that increases linearly with system size in one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ chains at selected anisotropies and phase-fixing boundary fields. The effect combines arbitrary integer periodicities in a single system, exceeding the $4\pi $ and $8\pi $ periodicity of superconducting Josephson effects of Majorana zero modes and other exotic quasiparticles. We reveal a universal energy-phase relation and connect the effect to the recently discovered phantom helices.</description>

      <title>Strong effects of thermally induced low-spin-to-high-spin crossover on transport properties of correlated metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use dynamical mean-field theory to study how electronic transport in multi-orbital metals is influenced by correlated (nominally) empty orbitals that are in proximity to the Fermi level. Specifically, we study 2 + 1 orbital and 3 + 2 orbital (i.e. t2g + eg ) models on a Bethe lattice with a crystal field that is set so that the higher lying orbitals are nearly empty at low temperatures but get a non-negligible occupancy at elevated temperature. The high temperature regime is characterized by thermal activation of carriers leading to higher magnetic response (i.e., thermally induced low-spin to high-spin transition) and substantial influence on resistivity, where one can distinguish two counteracting effects: increased scattering due to formation of high spin and increased scattering phase space on one hand, and additional parallel conduction channel on the other. The former effect is stronger and one may identify cases where resistivity increases by a factor of three at high temperatures even though the occupancy of the unoccupied band remains small (&lt; 10%). We discuss implications of our findings for transport properties of correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum-metric-induced giant and reversible nonreciprocal transport phenomena in chiral loop-current phases of kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rich spontaneous symmetry-breaking phenomena with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. The emergence of chiral loop-current order, accompanied by time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in various kagome metals, has garnered significant attention as a novel quantum topological state. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) in CsV3Sb5 [Guo et al, Nature 611, 461 (2022)], which provides compelling evidence of TRS and inversion-symmetry breaking. However, the underlying essence of this observation has remained obscured due to the lack of theoretical understanding. Here, we identify that the chiral loop-current induces substantial and switchable eMChA in kagome metals by taking account of the experimentally observed stripe charge-density-wave. The obtained eMChA coefficient is $\gamma_{eM}\propto M_{orb} \tau$, where $M_{orb}$ is the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization and $\tau$ is the lifetime of conduction electrons. Importantly, giant eMChA arises from the quantum metric (QM), which defines essential quantum phases of matter and their unique functionalities, including nonlinear effects. This effect is resonantly amplified in the loop-current phase, and the derived eMChA is switched by minute magnetic fields. This research elucidates the fundamental symmetry breaking in kagome metals and also sets the stage for investigating the QM-induced phenomena arising from electronic correlations.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of UTe$_2$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A heavy-fermion paramagnet UTe$_2$ has been a strong candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor. Experiments on \ute under pressure have been vigorously conducted, and rich phase diagrams have been suggested. Multiple superconducting phases exist in the pressure region of $0 \leq P &lt; 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$, and an antiferromagnetic ordered state is observed in the high-pressure region $P &gt; 1.8 \mathrm{\;GPa}$. However, under pressure, an underlying electronic structure in the normal state has not been clarified, although knowledge of electronic structures is essential for studying magnetic and superconducting states. As an indispensable step toward understanding the phase diagram of UTe$_2$, we study the electronic structure under hydrostatic and uniaxial pressures based on density functional theory with and without employing structural optimization. It is shown that the low-energy band structure and Fermi surfaces are not sensitive to pressure for parameters where itinerant $f$-electrons are not essential. However, we find significant pressure dependence for particular Coulomb interaction $U$ of the GGA+$U$ calculation, where the large weight of $f$-electrons appears on the Fermi level. We also discuss the possibility of a pressure-induced Lifshitz transition accompanied by the topological superconducting transition. The electronic structure can change from three-dimensional to two-dimensional under uniaxial pressure along the [010] and [001] axes.</description>

      <title>Exotic Kondo effect in two one dimensional spin 1/2 chains coupled to two localized spin 1/2 magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an exotic Kondo effect in a system consisting of two one-dimensional XX Heisenberg ferromagnetic spin $1/2$ chains (denoted by $\alpha = u, d$ for up and down chains) coupled to a quantum dot consisting of two localized spin $1/2$ magnets. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation on the Heisenberg Hamiltonian of the two chains, this system can be expressed in terms of non-interacting spinless fermionic quasiparticles. As a result, the Hamiltonian of the whole system is expressed as an Anderson model for spin 1/2 fermions interacting with a spin-1/2 impurity. Thus, we study the scattering of fermionic quasiparticles (propagating along spin chains) by a pair of localized magnetic impurities. At low temperature, the localized spin $1/2$ magnets are shielded by the chain `spins' via the Kondo effect. We calculate the Kondo temperature $T_K$ and derive the temperature dependence of the entropy, the specific heat, the specific heat and the `magnetic susceptibility' of the dot for $T \gg T_K$. Our results can be generalized to the case of anti-ferromagnetic XX chains.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Hall effects in a quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that electronic correlation, geometric frustration, and topology, \textit{individually}, can facilitate the emergence of various intriguing properties that have attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. Here, we report a systematic investigation on a quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$. A series of unconventional Hall effects are observed. In the paramagnetic phase, signature of dynamic $c$-$f$ hybridization is revealed by a reduction of anomalous Hall effect and is connected to frustration-promoted incoherent Kondo scattering. A large topological Hall effect exceeding 0.2 $\mu\Omega$ cm is found at low temperatures, which should be ascribed to the noncolinear magnetic structures of the frustrated quasi-kagome lattice. In addition, a peculiar loop-shaped Hall effect with switching chirality is also seen, which is inferred to be associated with magnetic domain walls that pin history-dependent spin chirality and / or Fermi-arc surface states projected from the in-gap Weyl nodes. These exotic results place Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$ in a regime of highly-frustrated antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice with a nontrivial topology on an ``extended" global phase diagram, and highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, geometric frustration and topology.</description>

      <title>Edge modes of topologically ordered systems as emergent integrable flows: Robustness of algebraic structures in nonlinear quantum fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these decades, it has been gradually established that edge modes of a wide class of topologically ordered systems are governed by the bulk-edge correspondence and anyon condensation. The former has been studied many times because it can be summarized as the correspondence between conformal field theory and topological quantum field theory, but the latter has captured attention more recently because it suggests that one can deform the theories from one to another condensable or Witt equivalent. We reinterpret this phenomenon as the appearance of integrable flow at the edges of a topologically ordered system. By revisiting the existing phenomena from this view, one can relate the anyon condensation to the existing formalism of integrable models and their renormalization group flow. Moreover, we observe the robustness of the bulk-edge correspondence even under the existence of irrelevant perturbations at the edges. This formulation can enable one to analyze edge modes at the level of quantum fluid (non-linear) dynamics, or mixed state topological order even in non-Hermitian systems. Moreover, especially in the study of a class of non-Hermitian systems, we show a fundamental necessity to revisit Rogers-Ramanujan type identities as an appearance of the hidden (fractional) supersymmetric model which has a close relation to string field theories. Our view can give a unified paradigm to study edge modes of topologically ordered systems at the level of their dynamics potentially in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Frustrated charge density wave and quasi-long-range bond-orientational order in the magnetic kagome FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic frustrated nature of a kagome lattice is amenable to the realization of exotic phases of matter, such as quantum spin liquids or spin ices, and more recently the multiple-$\mathrm{\textbf{q}}$ charge density waves (CDW) in the kagome metals. Despite intense efforts to understand the mechanism driving the electronic modulations, its origin is still unknown and hindered by competing interactions and intertwined orders. Here, we identify a dimerization-driven 2D hexagonal charge-diffuse precursor in the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe and demonstrate that the fraction of dimerized/undimerized states is the relevant order parameter of the multiple-$\mathrm{\textbf{q}}$ CDW of a continuous phase transition. The pretransitional charge fluctuations with propagation vector $\mathrm{\textbf{q}=\textbf{q}_M}$ at T$_{\mathrm{CDW}}$$&lt;$T$&lt;$T$^*$(125 K) are anisotropic, hence holding a quasi-long-range bond-orientational order. The broken translational symmetry emerges from the anisotropic diffuse precursor, akin to the Ising scenario of antiferromagnetic triangular lattices. The temperature and momentum dependence of the critical scattering show parallels to the stacked hexatic $\mathrm{B}$-phases reported in liquid crystals and transient states of CDWs and highlight the key role of the topological defect-mediated melting of the CDW in FeGe.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scaling behavior of the two-dimensional random singlet state in the random $Q$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the scaling relation of energy and length scales in the 2D random-singlet (RS) state of the random $Q$ model. To investigate the intrinsic energy scale of the spinon subsystem arising from the model, we develop a constrained subspace update algorithm within the framework of the stochastic series expansion method (SSE) to extract the singlet-triplet gap of the system. The 2D RS state exhibits scaling behavior similar to the infinite randomness fixed point (IRFP), at least within the length scales that we simulate. Furthermore, by rescaling the system size according to the strength of randomness, we observe that the data for the excitation gap and the width of the gap distribution collapse onto a single curve. This implies that the model with different strengths of randomness may correspond to the same fixed point.</description>

      <title>Projective spin adaptation for the exact diagonalization of isotropic spin clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin Hamiltonians, like the Heisenberg model, are used to describe magnetic properties of exchange-coupled molecules and solids. For finite clusters, physical quantities such as heat capacities, magnetic susceptibilities or neutron-scattering spectra, can be calculated based on energies and eigenstates obtained by exact diagonalization (ED). Utilizing spinrotational symmetry SU(2) to factor the Hamiltonian with respect to total spin S facilitates ED, but the conventional approach to spin-adapting the basis is more intricate than selecting states with a given magnetic quantum number M (the spin z-component), as it relies on irreducible tensor-operator techniques and spin-coupling coefficients. Here, we present a simpler technique based on applying a spin projector to uncoupled basis states. As an alternative to L\"owdin's projection operator, we consider a group-theoretical formulation of the projector, which can be evaluated either exactly or approximately using an integration grid. An important aspect is the choice of uncoupled basis states. We present an extension of L\"owdin's theorem for s = 1/2 to arbitrary local spin quantum numbers s, which allows for the direct selection of configurations that span a complete, linearly independent basis in an S sector upon spin projection. We illustrate the procedure with a few examples.</description>

      <title>Constraints on superconducting pairing in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the recently discovered altermagnetic materials hosts large prospects for both fundamental physics and technological applications. In this work we show that a characteristic spin-sublattice locking in altermagnets puts severe constraints on possible superconducting pairing. In particular, we uncover that the most common form of superconductivity, uniform $s$-wave spin-singlet pairing is not possible to achieve in altermagnets. Considering an effective model for a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet on a square lattice, we instead find that the most likely forms of spin-singlet pairing have $d_{x^2-y^2}$- or extended $s$-wave symmetry. We also find that the simplest form of equal-spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing is not allowed, but it can only exist as a mixed-spin-triplet $p$-wave state. We verify these constraints on pairing within an interaction-induced model of altermagnetism, where we also establish their validity for finite-momentum pairing. Additionally we discuss the possible pairing symmetries for odd-frequency superconducting pairing. Due to the generality of our results, they are applicable to both intrinsic superconductivity and proximity-induced superconductivity in altermagnet-superconductor hybrid junctions.</description>

Abstract: These lectures present the Fermi-liquid theory of superconductivity, which is applicable to a broad range of systems that are candidates for non-s wave pairing, {\it e.g.} the heavy fermions, organic metals and the CuO superconductors. Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory provides an important link between experimental properties of non-s wave superconductors and the more general Fermi-liquid theory. The multiple superconducting phases of UPt$_3$ provide an ideal example of the role that is played by the GL theory for non-s wave superconductors. The difference between non-s wave superconductivity and conventional anisotropic superconductivity is illustrated here by the unique effects that impurities are predicted to have on the properties of non-s wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Localized RG flows on composite defects and $\mathcal{C}$-theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a composite defect system where a lower-dimensional defect (sub-defect) is embedded to a higher-dimensional one, and examine renormalization group (RG) flows localized on the defect. A composite defect is constructed in the $(3-\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\text{O}(N)$ vector model with line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to non-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$. We also examine a $\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the sub-defect and show that the $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Role of scaling dimensions in generalized noises in fractional quantum Hall tunneling due to a temperature bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continued improvement of heat control in mesoscopic conductors brings novel tools for probing strongly correlated electron phenomena. Motivated by these advances, we comprehensively study transport due to a temperature bias in a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the charge-current noise (so-called delta-$T$ noise), heat-current noise, and mixed noise and elucidate how these observables can be used to infer strongly correlated properties of the device. Our main focus is the extraction of so-called scaling dimensions of the tunneling anyonic quasiparticles, of critical importance to correctly infer their anyonic exchange statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative experimental protocol for the detection of doped Chern insulators and chiral superconductors. Our approach relies on coupling the target chiral system to adatom spins. Due to the substrate chirality, the adatom spins are expected to order in a noncoplanar configuration with a nonzero spin chirality. Here, we obtain concrete results for chiral substrates which are invariant under arbitrary spin rotations, and are coupled to three adatoms carrying classical moments. By exploring all the accessible magnetic ground states, we identify the regimes in which nonzero spin chirality is induced on the adatom complex. We apply our method to valley-polarized bilayer graphene and $d+id$ superconductors, and find qualitatively different ground state diagrams. Our analysis shows that the adatom spin chirality fully encodes the properties of the substrate chirality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) of a two-dimensional gapped ground state obeys the universal inequality $\gamma \geq \log \mathcal{D}$, where $\gamma$ is the TEE and $\mathcal{D}$ is the total quantum dimension of all anyon excitations, $\mathcal{D} = \sqrt{\sum_a d_a^2}$. Here we present an alternative, more direct proof of this inequality. Our proof uses only the strong subadditivity property of the von Neumann entropy together with a few physical assumptions about the ground state density operator. Our derivation naturally generalizes to a variety of systems, including spatially inhomogeneous systems with defects and boundaries, higher dimensional systems, and mixed states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gas microscopy has developed into a powerful tool to explore strongly correlated quantum systems. However, discerning phases with topological or off-diagonal long range order requires the ability to extract these correlations from site-resolved measurements. Here, we show that a multi-scale complexity measure can pinpoint the transition to and from the bond ordered wave phase of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model with an off-diagonal order parameter, sandwiched between diagonal charge and spin density wave phases, using only diagonal descriptors. We study the model directly in the thermodynamic limit using the recently developed variational uniform matrix product states algorithm, and draw our samples from degenerate ground states related by global spin rotations, emulating the projective measurements that are accessible in experiments. Our results will have important implications for the study of exotic phases using optical lattice experiments.</description>

Abstract: Capitalizing on recent work, that clarifies the consistent use of bosonization-debosonization methods to study Kondo-type quantum impurity models even in nonequilibrium settings, we revisit the compactification procedure of the two-channel Kondo model (by which it is rewritten more ``compactly'' using the single-channel version of the model and exploiting separation and duality between spin and charge) and uncover some hidden approximations that could limit its range of validity. This complements and extends, for two or any even number of channels, beyond previous work on the Toulouse limit of these models, and reinforces the need for the use of an extended framework in these calculations. We carry out a number of exact comparisons between the different models, and show that keeping track of the, so-called, consistency factors leads to full agreement between the compactified and original versions of the model.</description>

Abstract: Following up on the systematic compactification of the two-channel Kondo model (and its multichannel extensions; see $\href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.03569}{\textsf{companion paper I}}$) and the demonstration of its validity over the past proposal of compactification, we resort to a study of scaling using Anderson's simple poor man's procedure to carry out a comparative study of these two and the original model. By doing so we unveil a universal agreement among the three models in how they flow upon scaling, and suggest the general limits of such a concordance. In this way we further elucidate the conditions under which the standard simplifications implicit in many bosonization-based mappings (particularly of quantum impurity models) can be used reliably, and when the consistent bosonization-debosonization approach is needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a field-theoretical renormalization group procedure based on the Callan-Symanzik equation to calculate the detailed flow for the (multi) two-channel Kondo model and its compactified versions. In doing so, we go beyond the universal terms in the beta function we obtained using poor man's scaling (see $\href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.03590}{\textsf{companion paper II}}$) and culminate our analysis of how the compactified versions of the model fare against the original one. Among other results, we explore the large-channel-number limit and extend our considerations to the finite temperature crossover region. Moreover, we gain insights into the contradistinction between the consistent vs. conventional bosonization-debosonization formalisms, thereby advancing our understanding on multiple fronts. In particular, we make use of renormalization-flow arguments to further justify the consistent refermionization of the parallel Kondo interaction we presented earlier (see $\href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.03569}{\textsf{companion paper I}}$)</description>

Abstract: We show how the stability conditions for a system of interacting fermions that conventionally involve variations of thermodynamic potentials can be rewritten in terms of one- and two-particle correlators. We illustrate the applicability of this alternative formulation in a multi-orbital model of strongly correlated electrons at finite temperatures, inspecting the lowest eigenvalues of the generalized local charge susceptibility in proximity of the phase-separation region. Additionally to the conventional unstable branches, we address unstable solutions possessing a positive, rather than negative compressibility. Our stability conditions require no derivative of free energy functions with conceptual and practical advantages for actual calculations and offer a clear-cut criterion for analyzing the thermodynamics of correlated complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study many-body phase transitions in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic transversed field Ising model with an imaginary field and show that the system exhibits three phase transitions: one second-order phase transition and two $\mathcal{PT}$ phase transitions. The second-order phase transition occurring in the ground state is investigated via biorthogonal and self-normal entanglement entropy, for which we develop an approach to perform finite-size scaling theory to extract the central charge for small systems. Compared with the second-order phase transition, the first $\mathcal{PT}$ transition is characterized by the appearance of an exceptional point in the full energy spectrum, while the second $\mathcal{PT}$ transition only occurs in specific excited states. Furthermore, we interestingly show that both of exceptional points are second-order in terms of scalings of imaginary parts of the energy. This work provides an exact solution for many-body phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Cellular Automata Generated Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases and Detection Through Multi-Point Strange Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computer and system sciences, higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) are a type of cellular automata that evolve over multiple time steps and generate complex patterns, which have various applications such as secret sharing schemes, data compression, and image encryption. In this paper, we introduce HOCA to quantum many-body physics and construct a series of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of matter, in which symmetries are supported on a great variety of subsystems embbeded in the SPT bulk. We call these phases HOCA-generated SPT (HGSPT) phases. Specifically, we show that HOCA can generate not only well-understood SPTs with symmetries supported on either regular (e.g., line-like subsystems in the 2D cluster model) or fractal subsystems, but also a large class of unexplored SPTs with symmetries supported on more choices of subsystems. One example is \textit{mixed-subsystem SPT} that has either fractal and line-like subsystem symmetries simultaneously or two distinct types of fractal symmetries simultaneously. Another example is \textit{chaotic-subsystem SPT} in which chaotic-looking symmetries are significantly different from and thus cannot reduce to fractal or regular subsystem symmetries. We also introduce a new notation system to characterize HGSPTs. We prove that all possible subsystem symmetries in square lattice can be locally simulated by an HOCA generated symmetry. As the usual two-point strange correlators are trivial in most HGSPTs, we find that the nontrivial SPT orders can be detected by what we call \textit{multi-point strange correlators}. We propose a universal procedure to design the spatial configuration of the multi-point strange correlators for a given HGSPT phase. Specifically, we find deep connections between multi-point strange correlators and the spurious topological entanglement entropy (STEE), both exhibiting long range behavior in SRE states.</description>

Abstract: The time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method has become a very competitive numerical method for studying the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity problems. For small impurities, the most challenging calculation in TEMPO is to construct the matrix product state representation of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. In this work we propose an efficient method for this task, which exploits the time-translationally invariant property of the influence functional. The required number of matrix product state multiplication in our method is almost independent of the total evolution time, as compared to the method originally used in TEMPO which requires a linearly scaling number of multiplications. The accuracy and efficiency of this method are demonstrated for the Toulouse model and the single impurity Anderson model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for quantum impurity problems, which directly works in the steady state. The method embraces the well-established infinite matrix product state algorithms with the recently developed GTEMPO method, and benefits from both sides: it obtains real-time Green's functions without sampling noises and bath discretization error, it is applicable for any temperature without the sign problem, its computational cost is independent of the transient dynamics and does not scale with the number of baths. We benchmark the method on the finite-temperature equilibrium Green's function in the noninteracting limit against exact solutions and in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model against GTEMPO calculations. We also study the zero-temperature non-equilibrium steady state of an impurity coupled to two baths with a voltage bias, obtaining consistent particle currents with existing calculations. The method is ideal for studying steady-state quantum transport, and can be readily used as an efficient real-time impurity solver in the dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and optical conductivity in a two-valley system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical conductivity of a Fermi liquid (FL) in the absence of umklapp scattering is dramatically affected by the topology of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically, electron-electron (ee) scattering leads to rapid current relaxation in systems with multiple, or multiply connected, FSs, provided the valleys have different effective masses. This effect results from intervalley drag. We microscopically derive the optical conductivity of a two-valley system, both within the FL regime and near a quantum critical point (QCP) of the Ising-nematic type. In the FL regime, intervalley drag restores the Gurzhi-like scaling of the conductivity, $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^0$. This dependence contrasts sharply with the previously identified sub-leading contribution to the conductivity of a two-dimensional FL with a single convex FS, where $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^2 \ln |\omega|$. The vanishing of the leading term in the optical conductivity is a signature of geometric constraints on ee scattering channels, which are lifted for a multiply connected FS. A large differential response, $d \mathrm{Re} \sigma/d \mu$ with $\mu$ being the chemical potential, is predicted at the Lifshitz transition from a single-valley to a multi-valley FS, which should be observable within the experimentally accessible frequency range. Near a QCP, intervalley drag leads to a $|\omega|^{-2/3}$ scaling of $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega)$ in 2D, thus providing a specific current-relaxing process for this long-standing conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions of metals involve changes in the Fermi surface, and can be divided into three categories. The first two categories involve symmetry breaking, and lead to a deformation or reconstruction of the Fermi surface. The third category involves a change in the volume enclosed by the Fermi surface without any symmetry breaking: one phase is a Fermi liquid (FL) with the conventional Luttinger volume, while the other phase is a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*), which has a non-Luttinger volume Fermi surface accompanied by a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. It is a relatively simple matter to obtain a FL*-FL transition in Kondo lattice models. However, the FL*-FL transition can also be present in single-band Hubbard-like models: this is efficiently described by the `ancilla' method, which shows that the transition is a `flipped' Kondo lattice transition. This single-band FL*-FL transition is argued to apply to the metallic states of the hole-doped cuprates. In the clean limit, the critical properties of the quantum transitions in the three categories are distinct, but all lead to perfect metal transport in the quantum-critical regime. Impurity-induced `Harris disorder', with spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point, is a relevant perturbation to the clean critical points. In the presence of Harris disorder, all three categories exhibit strange metal behavior, which can be described by a universal two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>A Gallery of Soft Modes: Theory and Experiment at a Ferromagnetic Quantum Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the low-energy excitations in the vicinity of the quantum critical point in LiHoF$_4$, a physical realization of the Transverse Field Ising Model, focusing on the long-range fluctuations which soften to zero energy at the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. Microwave spectroscopy in tunable loop-gap resonator structures identifies and characterizes the soft mode and higher-energy electronuclear states. We study these modes as a function of frequency and magnetic fields applied transverse and parallel to the Ising axis. These are understood in the context of a theoretical model of a soft electronuclear mode that interacts with soft photons as well as soft phonons. We identify competing infrared divergences at the quantum critical point, coming from the photons and the electronuclear soft mode. It is an incomplete cancellation of these divergences that leads to the muted but distinct signatures observed in the experiments. The application of a longitudinal magnetic field gaps the soft mode. Measurements well away from the quantum critical point reveal a set of ``Walker'' modes associated with ferromagnetic domain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid state in $T$*-type La$_{1-x/2}$Eu$_{1-x/2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ revealed via element substitution effects on magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.03529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its unique structural features, the magnetism of single-layered cuprate with five oxygen coordination ($T$*-type structure) has not been investigated thus far. Here, we report the results of muon spin relaxation and magnetic susceptibility measurements to elucidate the magnetism of $T$*-type La$_{1-x/2}$Eu$_{1-x/2}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LESCO) via magnetic Fe- and non-magnetic Zn-substitution. We clarified the inducement of the spin-glass (SG)-like magnetically ordered state in La$_{1-x/2}$Eu$_{1-x/2}$Sr$_x$Cu$_y$Fe$_{1-y}$O$_4$ with $x = 0.24 + y$, and the non-magnetic state in La$_{1-x/2}$Eu$_{1-x/2}$Sr$_x$Cu$_y$Zn$_{1-y}$O$_4$ with $x$ = 0.24 after the suppression of superconductivity for $y$ $\geq$ 0.025. The SG state lies below $\sim$7 K in a wide Sr concentration range between 0.19 and 0.34 in 5$\%$ Fe-substituted LESCO. The short-range SG state is consistent with that originating from the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction in a metallic state. Thus, the results provide the first evidence for Fermi liquid (FL) state in the pristine $T$*-type LESCO. Taking into account the results of an oxygen $K$-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurement $[$J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 89, 075002 (2020)$]$ reporting the actual hole concentrations in LESCO, our results demonstrate the existence of the FL state in a lower hole-concentration region, compared to that in $T$-type La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. The emergence of the FL state in a lower hole-concentration region is possibly associated with a smaller charge transfer gap energy in the parent material with five oxygen coordination.</description>

      <title>Magnonic $\varphi$ Josephson junctions and synchronized precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian physics. One of its main goals is to engineer dissipation and to explore ensuing functionality. In magnonics, the effect of dissipation due to local damping on magnon transport has been explored. However, the effects of non-local damping on the magnonic analog of the Josephson effect remain missing, despite that non-local damping is inevitable and has been playing a central role in magnonics. Here, we uncover theoretically that a surprisingly rich dynamics can emerge in magnetic junctions due to intrinsic non-local damping, using analytical and numerical methods. In particular, under microwave pumping, we show that coherent spin precession in the right and left insulating ferromagnet (FM) of the junction becomes synchronized by non-local damping and thereby a magnonic analog of the $\varphi$ Josephson junction emerges, where $\varphi$ stands here for the relative precession phase of right and left FM in the stationary limit. Remarkably, $\varphi$ decreases monotonically from $ \pi$ to $\pi/2$ as the magnon-magnon interaction, arising from spin anisotropies, increases. Moreover, we also find a magnonic diode effect giving rise to rectification of magnon currents. Our predictions are readily testable with current device and measurement technologies at room temperatures.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal electrodynamics and the penetration depth of superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal quasiparticles in a clean type-II superconductor with line nodes give rise to a quadratic low-temperature change of the penetration depth, $\Delta \lambda \sim T^2$, as first shown by Kosztin and Leggett [I. Kosztin and A. J. Leggett, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 135 (1997)]. Here, we generalize this result to multiple nodes and compare it to numerically exact evaluations of the temperature-dependent penetration depth in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using a high-precision tight-binding model. We compare the calculations to recent penetration depth measurements in high purity single crystals of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ [J. F. Landaeta et al., arXiv:2312.05129]. When assuming the order parameter to have $\mathrm{B}_{1\mathrm{g}}$ symmetry, we find that both a simple $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and complicated gap structures with contributions from higher harmonics and accidental nodes can accommodate the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the spatially inhomogeneous condensates in the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model via the bosonic two-point function in the infinite-$N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work shows that the known phase boundary between the phase with chiral symmetry and the phase of spatially inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in the phase diagram of the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model can be detected from the bosonic two-point function alone and thereby confirms and extends previous results arXiv:hep-th/0008175, arXiv:0807.2571, arXiv:0909.3714, arXiv:1810.03921, arXiv:2203.08503. The analysis is referred to as the stability analysis of the symmetric phase and does not require knowledge about spatial modulations of condensates. We perform this analysis in the infinite-$N$ limit at nonzero temperature and nonzero quark and chiral chemical potentials also inside the inhomogeneous phase. Thereby we observe an interesting relation between the bosonic $1$-particle irreducible two-point vertex function of the chiral Gross-Neveu model and the spinodal line of the Gross-Neveu model.</description>

      <title>$T_c$ and the elastocaloric effect of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under $\langle 110 \rangle$ uniaxial stress: no indications of transition splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that the superconductivity of Sr2RuO4 has two components. Among this evidence is a jump in the shear elastic modulus $c_{66}$ at the critical temperature $T_c$, observed in ultrasound measurements. Such a jump is forbidden for homogeneous single-component order parameters, and implies that $T_c$ should develop as a cusp under the application of shear strain with $\langle 110 \rangle$ principal axes. This shear strain should split the onset temperatures of the two components, if they coexist, or select one component if they do not. Here, we report measurements of $T_c$ and the elastocaloric effect of Sr2RuO4 under uniaxial stress applied along the $[110]$ lattice direction. Within experimental resolution, we resolve neither a cusp in the stress dependence of $T_c$, nor any second transition in the elastocaloric effect data. We show that reconciling these null results with the observed jumps in $c_{66}$ requires extraordinarily fine tuning to a triple point of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter space. In addition, our results are inconsistent with homogeneous time reversal symmetry breaking at a temperature $T_2 \leq T_c$ as identified in muon spin relaxation experiments.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum error correcting codes from conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy subspace of a conformal field theory (CFT) can serve as a quantum error correcting code, with important consequences in holography and quantum gravity. We consider generic 1+1D CFT codes under extensive local dephasing channels and analyze their error correctability in the thermodynamic limit. We show that (i) there is a finite decoding threshold if and only if the minimal nonzero scaling dimension in the fusion algebra generated by the jump operator of the channel is larger than $1/2$ and (ii) the number of protected logical qubits $k \geq \Omega( \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. As an application, we show that the one-dimensional quantum critical Ising model has a finite threshold for certain types of dephasing noise. Our general results also imply that a CFT code with continuous symmetry saturates a bound on the recovery fidelity for covariant codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the combined effects of dynamical Coulomb blockade and integer quantum Hall effect in a coupled hybrid metal-semiconductor setup provide a pathway for realizing resonant tunneling in Luttinger liquids. This hybrid setup can be brought to the quantum critical regime by varying gate voltages and contact resistances. We explore the nature of quantum criticality, Kondo effect, charge fractionalization and transport in such a hybrid setup, and verify their robust non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Our work opens a promising route for quantum simulating exotic zero temperature quantum critical phenomena associated with Luttinger liquid physics in a nanoengineered electronic circuit with well-defined quantum Hall channels.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Adiabatic Learning for Quantum-Classical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-classical hybrid dynamics is crucial for accurately simulating complex systems where both quantum and classical behaviors need to be considered. However, coupling between classical and quantum degrees of freedom and the exponential growth of the Hilbert space present significant challenges. Current machine learning approaches for predicting such dynamics, while promising, remain unknown in their error bounds, sample complexity, and generalizability. In this work, we establish a generic theoretical framework for analyzing quantum-classical adiabatic dynamics with learning algorithms. Based on quantum information theory, we develop a provably efficient adiabatic learning (PEAL) algorithm with logarithmic system size sampling complexity and favorable time scaling properties. We benchmark PEAL on the Holstein model, and demonstrate its accuracy in predicting single-path dynamics and ensemble dynamics observables as well as transfer learning over a family of Hamiltonians. Our framework and algorithm open up new avenues for reliable and efficient learning of quantum-classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Petz map recovery for long-range entangled quantum many-body states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a tripartite quantum state on $A,B,C$ and the erasure channel on $C$, the rotated Petz map is a recovery channel that acts on $B$ to recover the erased quantum information. The infidelity of the best recovery is upper-bounded by the conditional mutual information (CMI). In this work, we study the infidelity of the rotated Petz map on several physically-relevant long-range entangled quantum states. Specifically, we study three classes of quantum phases: (i) steady states of measurement-induced phase transitions, (ii) critical ground state under local measurements, and (iii) chiral states under local measurements. We find that the average Petz map infidelity sharply distinguishes the three classes: (i) and (ii) are distinguished by the scaling of the infidelity with CMI and (iii) is characterized by an asymmetry of the infidelity with the rotation parameter. We also study Petz map recovery for topological order and find an operational interpretation of the topological entanglement entropy. Our result indicates that the Petz map fidelity is a useful diagnostic of quantum phases of matter.</description>
