      <title>Habitable Worlds Formed at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial supernovae were the first, great nucleosynthetic engines in the Universe, forging the elements required for the later formation of planets and life. Here we show that planetesimals, the precursors of terrestrial planets, formed around low-mass stars in the debris of the first cosmic explosions 200 Myr after the Big Bang, before the first galaxies and far earlier than previously thought. A dense core in one of these explosions collapsed to a protoplanetary disk in which several Earth masses of planetesimals formed 0.46 - 1.66 AU from their parent 0.7 M$_{\odot}$ star, where equilibrium temperatures varied from 269 K to 186 K, in water mass fractions that were only a factor of a few less than in the Solar System today. Habitable worlds thus formed among the first generation of stars in the Universe, before the advent of the first galaxies.</description>

      <title>Strong nebular HeII emission induced by He$^+$ ionizing photons escaping through the clumpy winds of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of nebular HeII-emission in both local and high-redshift galaxies remains an unsolved problem. Various theories have been proposed to explain it, including HeII-ionization by high mass X-ray binaries, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, or "stripped" He stars, shock ionization, and hidden AGNs. All these theories have shortcomings, however, leaving the cause of nebular HeII emission unclear. We investigate the hypothesis that the photons responsible for driving nebular HeII emissions are produced by the evolution of single massive stars and/or WR stars. We combine models of stellar evolution with population synthesis and nebular models to identify the most favorable scenarios for producing nebular HeII via this channel. We find that, if WR winds are clumpy enough to become close to optically thin, stellar populations with a wide range of metallicities and rotation rates can produce HeII ionizing photons at rates sufficient to explain the observed nebular $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ ratio $\sim 0.004-0.07$ found in HeII-emitting galaxies. Metal-poor, rapidly rotating stellar populations ($[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]=-2.0$, $v/v_\mathrm{crit}=0.4$) also reach these levels of HeII production even for partially clumpy winds. These scenarios also yield HeII, H$\beta$, and "Blue-Bump" line equivalent widths comparable to those observed in HeII emitters. Only for laminar, non-clumpy winds, do we fail to find combinations of metallicity and stellar rotation rate that yield $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ values as high as those observed in HeII-emitters. Contrary to previous findings, we conclude that single WR stars can be a strong source for nebular HeII emission if their winds are sufficiently clumpy allowing significant escape of hard ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Measuring the intracluster light fraction with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intracluster light (ICL) is an important tracer of a galaxy cluster's history and past interactions. However, only small samples have been studied to date due to its very low surface brightness and the heavy manual involvement required for the majority of measurement algorithms. Upcoming large imaging surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time are expected to vastly expand available samples of deep cluster images. However, to process this increased amount of data, we need faster, fully automated methods to streamline the measurement process. This paper presents a machine learning model designed to automatically measure the ICL fraction in large samples of images, with no manual preprocessing required. We train the fully supervised model on a training dataset of 50,000 images with injected artificial ICL profiles. We then transfer its learning onto real data by fine-tuning with a sample of 101 real clusters with their ICL fraction measured manually using the surface brightness threshold method. With this process, the model is able to effectively learn the task and then adapt its learning to real cluster images. Our model can be directly applied to Hyper Suprime-Cam images, processing up to 500 images in a matter of seconds on a single GPU, or fine-tuned for other imaging surveys such as LSST, with the fine-tuning process taking just 3 minutes. The model could also be retrained to match other ICL measurement methods. Our model and the code for training it is made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Constructing Merger Trees of Density Peaks Using Phase-Space Watershed Segmentation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure identification in cosmological simulations plays an important role in analysing simulation outputs. The definition of these structures directly impacts the inferred properties derived from these simulations. This paper proposes a more straightforward definition and model of structure by focusing on density peaks rather than halos and clumps. It introduces a new watershed algorithm that uses phase-space analysis to identify structures, especially in complex environments where traditional methods may struggle due to spatially overlapping structures. Additionally, a merger tree code is introduced to track density peaks across timesteps, making use of the boosted potential for identifying the most bound particles for each peak.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: the subtle role of environment and not-so-subtle impact of generations of stars on galaxy dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar age and mass of galaxies have been suggested as the primary determinants for the dynamical state of galaxies, with environment seemingly playing no or only a very minor role. We use a sample of 77 galaxies at intermediate redshift (z~0.3) in the Middle-Ages Galaxies Properties with Integral field spectroscopy (MAGPI) Survey to study the subtle impact of environment on galaxy dynamics. We use a combination of statistical techniques (simple and partial correlations and principal component analysis) to isolate the contribution of environment on galaxy dynamics, while explicitly accounting for known factors such as stellar age, star formation histories and stellar masses. We consider these dynamical parameters: high-order kinematics of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (parametrised by the Gauss-Hermite coefficients $h_3$ and $h_4$), kinematic asymmetries $V_{\rm asym}$ derived using kinemetry and the observational spin parameter proxy $\lambda_{R_e}$. Of these, the mean $h_4$ is the only parameter found to have a significant correlation with environment as parametrised by group dynamical mass. This correlation exists even after accounting for age and stellar mass trends. Finally, we confirm that variations in the spin parameter $\lambda_{R_e}$ are most strongly (anti-)correlated with age as seen in local studies, and show that this dependence is well-established by z~0.3.</description>

      <title>Exploring the spatially resolved initial mass function in SAMI star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) is a construct that describes the distribution of stellar masses for a newly formed population of stars. It is a fundamental element underlying all of star and galaxy formation, and has been the subject of extensive investigation for more than 60 years. In the past few decades there has been a growing, and now substantial, body of evidence supporting the need for a variable IMF. In this light, it is crucial to investigate the IMF's characteristics across different spatial scales and to understand the factors driving its variability. We make use of spatially resolved spectroscopy to examine the high-mass IMF slope of star-forming galaxies within the SAMI survey. By applying the Kennicutt method and stellar population synthesis models, we estimated both the spaxel-resolved ($\alpha_{res}$) and galaxy-integrated ($\alpha_{int}$) high-mass IMF slopes of these galaxies. Our findings indicate that the resolved and integrated IMF slopes exhibit a near 1:1 relationship for $\alpha_{int}&gt; -2.7$. We observe a wide range of $\alpha_{res}$ distributions within galaxies. To explore the sources of this variability, we analyse the relationships between the resolved and integrated IMF slopes and both the star formation rate (SFR) and SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$). Our results reveal a strong correlation where flatter/steeper slopes are associated with higher/lower SFR and $\Sigma_{SFR}$. This trend is qualitatively similar for resolved and global scales. Additionally, we identify a mass dependency in the relationship with SFR, though none was found in the relation between the resolved slope and $\Sigma_{SFR}$. These findings suggest an scenario where the formation of high-mass stars is favoured in regions with more concentrated star formation. This may be a consequence of the reduced fragmentation of molecular clouds, which nonetheless accrete more material.</description>

      <title>Cold Gas and Star Formation in the Phoenix Cluster with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present integral field unit observations of the Phoenix Cluster with the JWST Mid-infrared Instrument's Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). We focus this study on the molecular gas, dust, and star formation in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use precise spectral modeling to produce maps of the silicate dust, molecular gas, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the inner $\sim$50 kpc of the cluster. We have developed a novel method for measuring the optical depth from silicates by comparing the observed H$_2$ line ratios to those predicted by excitation models. We provide updated measurements of the total molecular gas mass of $2.2^{+0.4}_{-0.1} \times 10^{10}$ ${\rm M}_\odot$, which agrees with CO-based estimates, providing an estimate of the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 0.9 \pm 0.2\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}\,({\rm K}\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1})^{-1}$; an updated stellar mass of $M_* = 2.6 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{10}$ ${\rm M}_\odot$; and star formation rates averaged over 10 and 100 Myr of $\langle{\rm SFR}\rangle_{\rm 10} = 1340 \pm 100$ ${\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $\langle{\rm SFR}\rangle_{\rm 100} = 740 \pm 80$ ${\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, respectively. The H$_2$ emission seems to be powered predominantly by star formation within the central $\sim 20$ kpc, with no need for an extra particle heating component as is seen in other BCGs. Additionally, we find nearly an order of magnitude drop in the star formation rates estimated by PAH fluxes in cool core BCGs compared to field galaxies, suggesting that hot particles from the intracluster medium are destroying PAH grains even in the centralmost 10s of kpc.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 19 strongly-lensed quasars, dual and projected quasars in DESI-LS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of two lensed quasars, six dual quasars, and eleven projected quasars that were previously identified as lensed-quasar candidates in \cite{He2023}. The spectroscopic data were obtained from two different sources: the P200/DBSP in California and publicly available datasets, including SDSS and DESI-EDR. The two lensed quasars (both pairs) have the following properties: $\theta_E$ = 1.208'', $z_s$ = 3.105; $\theta_E$ = 0.749, $z_s$ = 2.395. The six dual quasars have redshifts ranging from 0.58 to 3.28 and projected separations ranging from 15.44 to 22.54 kpc, with a mean separation of 17.95 kpc. The eleven projected quasars have projected separations ranging from 10.96 to 39.07 kpc, with a mean separation of 22.64 kpc. Additionally, there are three likely lensed quasars that cannot be definitively confirmed, contributed by two reasons. Firstly, their image separations (0.83'', 0.98'', and 0.93'') are small compared to the seeing conditions during our observations (around 1.2''). Secondly, no high SNR lensing galaxy can be detected in the Legacy Survey Imaging. Better spectroscopy and (or) imaging are needed to confirm their lensing nature.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the kinematics of a central region in the triple AGN host NGC 7733-7734 interacting group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the interacting triple active galactic nuclear system NGC 7733-34, focusing on stellar kinematics, ionised gas characteristics and star formation within the central region and stellar bars of both galaxies. We performed a comprehensive analysis using archival data from MUSE, HST/ACS, and DECaLS, complemented by observations from UVIT and IRSF. We identified a disc-like bulge in both NGC 7733 and NGC 7734 through 2-D decomposition. A central nuclear structure, with a semi-major axis of $\sim$1.113 kpc, was detected in NGC 7733 via photometric and kinematic analysis, confirmed by the strong anti-correlation between $V/\sigma$ and $h_{3}$, indicative of circular orbits in the centre. NGC 7734 lacks a distinct nuclear structure. The presence of disc-like bulge results in an anti-correlation between $V/\sigma$ and $h_{3}$ along with diffuse light. However, it does show higher central velocity dispersion, possibly attributed to an interaction with a smaller clump, which is likely a fourth galaxy within the system. Both galaxies demonstrate ongoing star formation, evidenced by $FUV$ and $H\alpha$ observations. NGC 7734 shows recent star formation along its bar, while NGC 7733 experiences bar quenching. The star formation rate (SFR) analysis of NGC 7734 reveals that the bar region's SFR dominates the galaxy's overall SFR. Conversely, in NGC 7733, the lack of star formation along the bar and the presence of a Seyfert 2 active galactic nuclei at the galaxy centre leave the possibility of a connection between both facts. However, it does not affect the galaxy's overall star formation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the stellar and gas kinematics, star formation processes, and active galactic nuclear feedback mechanisms in interacting galaxies hosting stellar bars.</description>

      <title>LAMOST medium-resolution spectroscopic survey of Galactic Open Clusters (LAMOST-MRS-O): An overview of survey plan and preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the LAMOST medium-resolution spectroscopic survey, the LAMOST-MRS-O is a non-time domain survey that aims to perform medium-resolution spectral observations for member stars in the open cluster area. This survey plans to obtain the spectroscopic parameters such as radial velocity and metal abundances of member stars and provide data support for further study on the chemical and dynamical characteristics and evolution of open clusters in combination with Gaia data. We have completed the observations on ten open cluster fields and obtained 235184 medium-resolution spectra of 133792 stars. Based on the data analyzed of LAMOST DR11V1.1, for some clusters of particular concern, it is found that the sampling ratio of members stars with Gmag &lt; 15 mag can reach 70%, which indicates that the LAMOST-MRS-O has reached our initial design goal.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Star Formation Histories Reveal Formative Starbursts Experienced by Lyman Alpha Emitting Galaxies at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we test the conventional assumption that Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs) are experiencing their first major burst of star formation at the time of observation. To this end, we identify 74 LAEs from the ODIN Survey with rest-UV-through-NIR photometry from UVCANDELS. For each LAE, we perform non-parametric star formation history (SFH) reconstruction using the Dense Basis Gaussian process-based method of spectral energy distribution fitting. We find that a strong majority (67%) of our LAE SFHs align with the conventional archetype of a first major star formation burst, with at most modest star formation rates (SFRs) in the past. However, the rest of our LAE SFHs have significant amounts of star formation in the past, with 28% exhibiting earlier bursts of star formation with the ongoing burst having the highest SFR (dominant bursts), and the final 5% having experienced their highest SFR in the past (non-dominant bursts). Combining the SFHs indicating first and dominant bursts, 95% of LAEs are experiencing their largest burst yet -- a formative burst. This suggests that LAEs have more complicated stellar mass assembly than expected. We also find that the fraction of total stellar mass created in the last 200 Myr is ~1.33 times higher in LAEs than in control Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) samples, and that a majority of LBGs are experiencing dominant bursts, reaffirming that LAEs differ from other star forming galaxies. Overall, our results suggest that multiple evolutionary paths can produce galaxies with strong observed Ly$\alpha$ emission.</description>

      <title>Growth of Diffuse Intragroup Light in Simulated Galaxy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse intragroup light (IGL) is a pervasive feature of galaxy groups consisting of an extended low-surface-brightness component that permeates the intergalactic medium of these galaxy associations. It is primarily formed by stars separated from their host galaxies and now drift freely, unbound to any particular galaxy. We used controlled numerical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of IGL in galaxy groups during the pre-virialization phase. Our study reveals that the emergence of this diffuse luminous component typically begins to form in significant amounts around the turnaround epoch, increasing steadily thereafter. We analyzed the correlation between the mass and fraction of IGL and other group properties. We found a sublinear relationship between the IGL mass and the brightest group galaxy, suggesting intertwined formation histories but with potentially differing growth rates and distinct driving mechanisms. Additionally, we observed a negative correlation between the IGL fraction and the group's velocity dispersion, indicating that a lower velocity dispersion may enhance IGL formation through increased gravitational interaction effectiveness. Furthermore, our comparative analysis of the density profiles of IGL and total system mass revealed significant similarities, suggesting that the intragroup light serves as a reliable tracer of the gravitational potential of host groups, even when these galaxy aggregations are far from dynamic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The post-gas expulsion coalescence of embedded clusters as an origin of open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mismatch between the mass function of the Milky Way's embedded clusters (ECs) and that of open clusters (OCs) raises the question of whether each OC originates from a single EC. In this work, we explore a scenario in which OCs form as a result of post-gas expulsion coalescence of ECs within the same parental molecular cloud. We model this process using N-body simulations of ECs undergoing expansion due to gas expulsion. Our initial conditions are based on the observed spatial, kinematic, and mass distributions of ECs in three representative massive star-forming regions (MSFRs). Initially, ECs are isolated. After further expansion, interactions between ECs begin, mutually influencing their evolution. We examine this process as a function of gas expulsion timescales, spatial separations between ECs, and their relative velocities. Our results demonstrate that, within a reasonable range of these parameters, the coalescence of ECs is robust and largely insensitive to initial conditions. The mass of ECs plays a critical role in the coalescence process. More massive ECs form stable gravitational cores, which greatly facilitate coalescence and help the resulting cluster resist expansion and Galactic tidal forces. Additionally, the number of ECs also enhances coalescence. The current mass distribution of clumps in the Milky Way suggests that directly forming massive ECs is challenging. However, the coalescence of multiple low-mass ECs can account for the observed parameter space of OCs in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>On the abiotic origin of dimethyl sulfide: discovery of DMS in the Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the discovery of dimethyl sulfide (CH$_3$SCH$_3$, DMS) signatures in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we report the first detection of this organosulfur species in the interstellar medium, during the exploration of an ultradeep molecular line survey performed toward the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 with the Yebes 40$\,$m and IRAM 30$\,$m telescopes. We derive a molecular column density of $N$ = (2.6 $\pm$ 0.3)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, yielding a fractional abundance relative to H$_2$ of $\sim$1.9$\times$10$^{-10}$. This implies that DMS is a factor of $\sim$1.6 times less abundant than its structural isomer CH$_3$CH$_2$SH and $\sim$30 times less abundant than its O-analogue dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) toward this cloud, in excellent agreement with previous results on various O/S pairs. Furthermore, we find a remarkable resemblance between the relative abundance of DMS/CH$_3$OH in G+0.693-0.027 ($\sim$1.7$\times$10$^{-3}$) and in the comet ($\sim$1.3$\times$10$^{-3}$), further strengthening the connection between the chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and that of the minor bodies of the Solar System. Although the chemistry of DMS beyond Earth is yet to be fully disclosed, this discovery provides conclusive observational evidence on its efficient abiotic production in the interstellar medium, casting doubts about using DMS as a reliable biomarker in exoplanet science.</description>

      <title>Prompt gravitational-wave mergers aided by gas in Active Galactic Nuclei: The hydrodynamics of binary-single black hole scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole binary systems embedded in AGN discs have been proposed as a source of the observed gravitational waves (GWs) from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Studies have indicated binary-single encounters could be common place within this population, yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of how the ambient gas affects the dynamics of these three-body encounters. We present the first hydrodynamical simulations of black hole binary-single encounters in an AGN disc. We find gas is a non-negligible component of binary-single interactions, leading to unique dynamics, including the formation of quasi-stable hierarchical triples. The gas efficiently and reliably dissipates the energy of the three-body system, hardening the triple provided it remains bound after the initial encounter. The hardening timescale is shorter for higher ambient gas densities. Formed triple systems can be hardened reliably by $2-3$ orders of magnitude relative to the initial binary semi-major axis within less than a few AGN orbits, limited only by our resolution. We calculate that the gas hardening of the triple enhances the probability for a merger by a minimum factor of $3.5-8$ depending on our assumptions. In several cases, two of the black holes can execute periapses on the order of less than $10$ Schwarzschild radii, where the dynamics were fully resolved for previous close approaches. The likelihood of these prompt mergers increases when the gas density is larger. Our results suggest that current timescale estimates (without gas drag) for binary-single induced mergers are an upper bound. The shrinkage of the triple by gas has the prospect of increasing the chance for unique GW phenomena such as residual eccentricity, dephasing from a third object and double GW mergers.</description>

      <title>The NEMESIS Catalogue of Young Stellar Objects for the Orion Star Formation Complex. I. General description of data curation</title>

Abstract: The past decade has seen a rise in the use of Machine Learning methods in the study of young stellar evolution. This trend has led to a growing need for a comprehensive database of young stellar objects (YSO) that goes beyond survey-specific biases and that can be employed for training, validation, and refining the physical interpretation of machine learning outcomes. We reviewed the literature focused on the Orion Star Formation complex (OSFC) to compile a thorough catalogue of previously identified YSO candidates in the region including the curation of observables relevant to probe their youth. Starting from the NASA/ADS database, we assembled YSO candidates from more than 200 peer-reviewed publications. We collated data products relevant to the study of YSOs into a dedicated catalogue, which was complemented with data from large photometric and spectroscopic surveys and in the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center. We also added significant value to the catalogue by homogeneously deriving YSO infrared classification labels and through a comprehensive curation of labels concerning sources' multiplicity. Finally, we used a panchromatic approach to derive the probabilities that the sources in our catalogue were contaminant extragalactic sources or giant stars. We present the NEMESIS catalogue of YSOs for the OSFC, which includes data collated for 27879 sources covering the whole mass spectrum and the various stages of pre-Main Sequence evolution from protostars to diskless young stars. The catalogue includes a collection of panchromatic photometric data processed into spectral energy distributions, stellar parameters, infrared classes, equivalent widths of emission lines related to YSOs accretion and star-disk interaction, and absorption lines such as lithium and lines related to source's gravity, X-ray emission observables, photometric variability observables, and multiplicity labels.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray flares from the jet of the blazar CTA 102 in 2016-2018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CTA 102 is a $\gamma$-ray bright blazar that exhibited multiple flares in observations by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope during the period of 2016-2018. We present results from the analysis of multi-wavelength light curves aiming at revealing the nature of $\gamma$-ray flares from the relativistic jet in the blazar. We analyse radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray data obtained in a period from 2012 September 29 to 2018 October 8. We identify six flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve, showing a harder-when-brighter-trend in the $\gamma$-ray spectra. We perform a cross-correlation analysis of the multi-wavelength light curves. We find nearly zero time lags between the $\gamma$-ray and optical and X-ray light curves, implying a common spatial origin for the emission in these bands. We find significant correlations between the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves as well as negative/positive time lags with the $\gamma$-ray emission lagging/leading the radio during different flaring periods. The time lags between $\gamma$-ray and radio emission propose the presence of multiple $\gamma$-ray emission sites in the source. As seen in 43 GHz images from the Very Long Baseline Array, two moving disturbances (or shocks) were newly ejected from the radio core. The $\gamma$-ray flares from 2016 to 2017 are temporally coincident with the interaction between a traveling shock and a quasi-stationary one at $\sim$0.1 mas from the core. The other shock is found to emerge from the core nearly simultaneous with the $\gamma$-ray flare in 2018. Our results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray flares originated from shock-shock interactions.</description>

      <title>The putative center in NGC 1052</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many active galaxies harbor powerful relativistic jets, however, the detailed mechanisms of their formation and acceleration remain poorly understood. To investigate the area of jet acceleration and collimation with the highest available angular resolution, we study the innermost region of the bipolar jet in the nearby low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy NGC 1052. We combined observations of NGC 1052 taken with VLBA, GMVA, and EHT over one week in the spring of 2017. For the first time, NGC 1052 was detected with the EHT, providing a size of the central region in-between both jet bases of 250 RS (Schwarzschild radii) perpendicular to the jet axes. This size estimate supports previous studies of the jets expansion profile which suggest two breaks of the profile at around 300 RS and 10000 RS distances to the core. Furthermore, we estimated the magnetic field to be 1.25 Gauss at a distance of 22 {\mu}as from the central engine by fitting a synchrotron-self absorption spectrum to the innermost emission feature, which shows a spectral turn-over at about 130 GHz. Assuming a purely poloidal magnetic field, this implies an upper limit on the magnetic field strength at the event horizon of 26000 Gauss, which is consistent with previous measurements. The complex, low-brightness, double-sided jet structure in NGC 1052 makes it a challenge to detect the source at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. However, our first EHT observations have demonstrated that detection is possible up to at least 230 GHz. This study offers a glimpse through the dense surrounding torus and into the innermost central region, where the jets are formed. This has enabled us to finally resolve this region and provide improved constraints on its expansion and magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Complex Structure around a Circumstellar Disk Caused by Interchange Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a strongly magnetized cloud core and investigate the complex structure caused by the interchange instability. This is the first simulation that does not use a central sink cell and calculates the long term ($&gt; 10^4$ yr) evolution even as the disk and outflow formation occur. The magnetic field dissipates inside the disk, and magnetic flux accumulates around the edge of the disk, leading to the occurrence of interchange instability. During the main accretion phase, the interchange instability occurs recurrently, disturbing the circumstellar region and forming ring, arc, and cavity structures. These are consistent with recent high-resolution observations of circumstellar regions around young protostars. The structures extend to $&gt;1,000$ au and persist for at least 30,000 yr after protostar formation, demonstrating the dynamic removal process of magnetic flux during star formation. We find that the disk continues to grow even as interchange instability occurs, by accretion through channels between the outgoing cavities. The outflow is initially weak, but becomes strong after $\sim 10^3$ yr.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a years-delayed radio flare from an unusually slow-evolved tidal disruption event</title>

Abstract: SDSS J1115+0544 is a unique low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxy with energetic ultraviolet (UV), optical and mid-infrared outbursts occurring in its nucleus. We present the results from an analysis of multi-wavelength photometric and radio follow-up observations covering a period of ~9 years since its discovery. We find that following a luminosity plateau of ~500 days, the UV/optical emission has decayed back to the pre-outburst level, suggesting that the nuclear outburst might be caused by a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE). In this case, SDSS J1115+0544 could be an unusually slow-evolved optical TDE with longest rise and decline time-scales ever found. Three years later than the optical peak, a delayed radio brightening was found with a 5.5 GHz luminosity as high as ~1.9x10^39 erg/s. Using a standard equipartition analysis, we find the outflow powering the radio emission was launched at t~1260 days with a velocity of beta&lt;~0.1 and kinetic energy of E_K~&gt;10^50 erg. The delayed radio brightening coupled with the disappearing plateau in the UV/optical light curves is consistent with the scenario involving delayed ejection of an outflow from a state transition in the disk. SDSS J1115+0544 is the first TDE displaying both a short-lived UV/optical plateau emission and a late-time radio brightening. Future radio observations of these TDEs in the post-plateau decay phase will help to establish the connection between outflow launching and changes in accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Properties of high-redshift Type II supernovae discovered by the JADES transient survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 &lt;= z &lt;= 3.61 discovered by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. This high-redshift Type II SN sample allows us to compare low-redshift Type II SNe to their high-redshift counterparts. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxies of Radio AGN: New Views from Combining LoTSS and MaNGA Observations</title>

Abstract: We utilize a combination of radio continuum observations and optical integral field spectroscopic (IFS) data to explore the impact of radio AGN on the evolution of their host galaxies at both global and sub-galactic scales. We construct a comprehensive radio-IFS sample comprising 5548 galaxies with redshift z&lt;0.15 by cross-matching the LoTSS with the MaNGA survey. We revisit the tight linear radio continuum - star formation relation and quantify its intrinsic scatter, then use the relation to classify 616 radio-excess AGN with excessive radio luminosities over that expected from their star formation rate. Massive radio AGN host galaxies are predominantly quiescent systems, but the quenching level shows no correlation with the jet luminosity. The mass assembly histories derived from the stellar population synthesis model fitting agree with the cosmological simulations incorporating radio-mode AGN feedback models. We observe that radio AGN hosts grow faster than a control sample of galaxies matched in stellar mass, and the quenching age ($\sim$5 Gyr) is at larger lookback times than the typical radio jet age (&lt;1 Gyr). By stacking the spectra in different radial bins and comparing results for radio AGN hosts and their controls, we find emission line excess features in the nuclear region of radio AGN hosts. This excess is more prominent in low-luminosity, low-mass, and compact radio AGN. The [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios of the excessive emission line indicate that radio AGN or related jets are ionizing the surrounding interstellar medium in the vicinity of the nucleus. Our results support the scenario that the observed present-day radio AGN activity may help their host galaxies maintain quiescence through gas ionization and heating, but it is not responsible for the past quenching of their hosts.</description>

      <title>Core Revelations: the Star Formation and AGN Connection at the Heart of NGC 7469</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation-AGN connection in the Seyfert 1 NGC 7469 using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mid-infrared spectroscopic integral field unit (IFU) data. We use the IFU data to generate maps of different emission lines present in the spectrum, such as the star formation (SF) tracer [Ne II] 12.81{\mu}m, and the AGN tracer [Ne V] 14.32{\mu}m. We can separate the AGN- and SF-dominated regions using spatially resolved mid-infrared diagnostic diagrams, and further investigate the ionization sources powering each region by constructing photoionization models. We find that the previously detected eastern wind populates an intermediary region of the diagrams, between our star-forming and AGN points. Although it is possible that the star-forming ring may inherently not be uniform, this wind also coincides with a reduction in the [Ne II] emission in the ring, which suggests that the ionization cone intersects the ring in this direction.</description>

      <title>Investigating C-D out-of-plane vibrational modes in PAHs as a tool to study interstellar deuterium-containing PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAH-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative tool is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out-of-plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes in PAHs bearing a single to multiple deuterium atoms are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. This paper reports that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at the 14-19 micron range. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to the D/H ratio in PAHs. In addition, a moderate change in the spectra of deuterated PAHs is observed from that of the undeuterated counterparts, as deuteration would alternate the adjacency class of the C-H bonds and the symmetry of the molecule. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.</description>

      <title>ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey: Properties of X-ray- and SED-selected AGNs in Bright Submillimeter Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the brightest submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the COSMOS field. We utilize the bright sample of ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey (AS2COSMOS), which consists of 260 SMGs with $S_{\mathrm{870}\, \mu \mathrm{m}}=0.7\text{--}19.2\,\mathrm{mJy}$ at $z=0\text{--}6$. We perform optical to millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling for the whole sample. We identify 24 AGN-host galaxies from the SEDs. Supplemented by 23 X-ray detected AGNs (X-ray AGNs), we construct an overall sample of 40 AGN-host galaxies. The X-ray luminosity upper bounds indicate that the X-ray undetected SED-identified AGNs are likely to be nearly Compton thick or have unusually suppressed X-ray emission. From visual classification, we identify $25^{+6}_{-5}$\% of the SMGs without AGNs as major merger candidates. This fraction is almost consistent with the general galaxy population at $z\sim2$, suggesting that major mergers are not necessarily required for the enhanced star formation in SMGs. We also identify $47^{+16}_{-15}$\% of the AGN hosts as major merger candidates, which is about twice as high as that in the SMGs without AGNs. This suggests that major mergers play a key role in triggering AGN activity in bright SMGs.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO project: the coupling between baryonic feedback and cosmology in light of the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale structure surveys have reported measurements of the density of matter, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, and the amplitude of clustering, $\sigma_8$, that are in tension with the values inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background. While this may be a sign of new physics that slows the growth of structure at late times, strong astrophysical feedback processes could also be responsible. In this work, we argue that astrophysical processes are not independent of cosmology and that their coupling naturally leads to stronger baryonic feedback in cosmological models with suppressed structure formation or when combined with a mechanism that removes dark matter from halos. We illustrate this with two well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model known to suppress structure formation: massive neutrinos and decaying dark matter. Our results, based on the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, show that the combined effect of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms is greater than the sum of its parts, particularly for decaying dark matter. We also show that the dependence of baryonic feedback on cosmology can be modelled as a function of the ratio $f_\mathrm{b}/c^2_\mathrm{v}\sim f_\mathrm{b}/(\Omega_\mathrm{m}\sigma_8)^{1/4}$ of the universal baryon fraction, $f_\mathrm{b}$, to a velocity-based definition of halo concentration, $c^2_\mathrm{v}$, giving an accurate fitting formula for the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. Although the combination of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms can resolve the tension, the models with neutrinos and decaying dark matter are challenged by constraints on the expansion history.</description>

      <title>New ultracool dwarf candidates from multi-epoch WISE data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thirty years after the discovery of brown dwarfs, the search for these objects continues, particularly in the vicinity of the Sun. Objects near the Sun are characterized by large proper motions, making them seen as fast-moving objects. While the Gaia DR3 catalogue is a comprehensive source of proper motions, it lacks the depth needed for discovering fainter objects. Modern multi-epoch surveys, with their greater depth, offer a new opportunity for systematic search for ultracool dwarfs. The study aims to systematically search for high proper motion objects using the newly released catalogue of epochal WISE data in order to identify new brown dwarf candidates in the solar neighborhood, estimate their spectral types, distances and spatial velocities. We used recently released unTimely catalogue of epochal detections in unWISE coadds to search for objects with high proper motions using simple motion detection algorithm, combined with machine learning based artefact rejection routine. This method was used to identify objects with proper motions exceeding approximately 0.3 arcseconds per year. The identified objects were then cross-referenced with data from other large-scale sky surveys to further analyze their characteristics. The search yielded 21,885 moving objects with significant proper motions, 258 of which had not been previously published. All except 6 of them are compatible with being ultracool dwarfs. Among these, at least 33 were identified as most promising new T dwarf candidates, with estimated distances closer than about 40 parsecs, and effective temperatures less than 1300 K.</description>

      <title>Half a Million Binary Stars from the low resolution spectra of LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are prevalent yet challenging to detect. We present a novel approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify binary stars from low-resolution spectra obtained by the LAMOST survey. The CNN is trained on a dataset that distinguishes binaries from single main sequence stars based on their positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Specifically, the training data labels stars with mass ratios between approximately 0.71 and 0.93 as intermediate mass ratio binaries, while excluding those beyond this range. The network achieves high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.949 on the test set. Its performance is further validated against known eclipsing binaries (97% detection rate) and binary stars identified by radial velocity variations (92% detection rate). Applying the trained CNN to a sample of one million main sequence stars from LAMOST DR10 and Gaia DR3 yields a catalog of 468,634 binary stars, which are mainly intermediate mass ratio binaries given the training data. This catalog includes 115 binary stars located beyond 10 kpc from the Sun and 128 cross-matched with known exoplanet hosts from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This new catalog provides a valuable resource for future research on the properties, formation, and evolution of binary systems, particularly for statistically characterizing large populations.</description>

      <title>The no-hair theorems at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a perturbative calculation to the first post-Newtonian order has shown that the analytically worked out Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital angular momentum of a test particle following a circular path around a massive spinning primary is able to explain the measured features of the jet precession of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. It is shown that also the hole's mass quadrupole moment $Q_2$, as given by the no-hair theorems, has a dynamical effect which cannot be neglected, as, instead, done so far in the literature. New allowed regions for the hole's dimensionless spin parameter $a^\ast$ and the effective radius $r_0$ of the accretion disk, assumed tightly coupled with the jet, are obtained by including both the Lense-Thirring and the quadrupole effects in the dynamics of the effective test particle modeling the accretion disk. One obtains that, by numerically integrating the resulting averaged equations for the rates of change of the angles $\eta$ and $\phi$ characterizing the orientation of the orbital angular momentum with $a^\ast = +0.98$ and $r_0=14.1$ gravitational radii, it is possible to reproduce, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the time series for them recently measured with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique. Instead, the resulting time series produced with $a^\ast = -0.95$ and $r_0=16$ gravitational radii turn out to be out of phase with respect to the observationally determined ones, while maintaining the same amplitudes.</description>
