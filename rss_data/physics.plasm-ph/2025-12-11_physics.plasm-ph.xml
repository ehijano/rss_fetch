      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Laser-Wakefield Acceleration via Spectral Pulse Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of spectral pulse shaping of the laser driver on the performance of channel-guided, laser-plasma accelerators. The study was carried out with the assistance of Bayesian optimization using particle-in-cell simulations. We used a realistic plasma profile based on a novel optical-field-ionized channel technique with ionization injection and low on-axis plasma densities to maximize the energy gain of the electron bunch trailing the laser. Spectral shaping allows us to modify the temporal profile of the laser driver while keeping the laser energy constant, affecting the acceleration and injection processes. Given the complexity and breadth of the parameter space in question, we used numerical optimization to identify high performers. In particular, we found laser profiles with additional spectral content that, when used with optimal plasma channel parameters, result in charge content an order of magnitude higher than the baseline Gaussian case while also increasing the mean energy of the electron bunch.</description>

      <title>The skin effect in anomalous transport of charged particles in plasma with a microturbulent magnetic field. I. Isotropic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of electromagnetic skin effect on anomalous charged particle transport in dense, non-relativistic, collisionless plasma with a small-scale turbulent magnetic field was investigated using quasi-linear kinetic equations, through both analytical and numerical methods. Analytical expressions for the diffusion tensor components in the Fokker-Planck equation that take this effect into account have been found. The equation was solved numerically in the case of magnetostatic turbulence. It has been demonstrated that the skin effect increases the mean free path of particles in turbulent plasma, thereby reducing its anomalous resistance. It also leads to anisotropy in particle scattering, resulting in anisotropy in their stationary velocity distribution, which increases as the screening parameter grows. Approximate analytical formulas for the effective mobility of charged particles and the electric conductivity of plasma with isotropic magnetostatic turbulence have been obtained.</description>

      <title>Activation of Polylactic Acid and Polycarbonate Surfaces with Non-Thermal Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-thermal plasma (NTP) surface activation has become a powerful and versatile strategy to engineer the interfacial properties of biomedical polymers whose intrinsic hydrophobicity limits their biological performance. In polymers such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC), NTP promotes the controlled incorporation of polar functional groups, increases surface energy, modifies dielectric behavior, and generates micro-roughness that collectively enhance protein adsorption and early cell adhesion. This review synthesizes and critically evaluates evidence across four complementary analytical pillars-contact-angle theory, dielectric impedance spectroscopy, FT-IR chemical mapping, and optical microscopy-to construct an integrated framework for interpreting plasma-induced chemical and morphological transformations.
  The convergence of multimodal results demonstrates that NTP consistently produces chemically active, polar, and moderately textured surfaces that support robust initial cell-material interactions. Furthermore, combining wettability, dielectric, and spectroscopic analysis enables the identification of activation pathways, the assessment of hydrophobic recovery dynamics, and the development of quantitative correlations between dielectric parameters and biological response. However, the literature also reveals key methodological gaps, including the limited use of unified multimodal protocols, insufficient evaluation of temporal stability, and a lack of predictive dielectric-biological models.
  By articulating these advances and limitations within a unified conceptual scheme, this review provides a roadmap for future research aimed at standardizing characterization workflows and enabling the rational design of next-generation plasma-functionalized biomaterials for tissue-engineering scaffolds, implantable devices, and advanced drug-delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Isotope Production in Fusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion systems producing isotopes via neutron-driven transmutation can achieve economic viability well before reaching energy breakeven. Incorporating carefully selected feedstock materials within the blanket allows fusion systems to generate both electrical power and high-value isotopes, expanding the space of viable concepts, significantly enhancing the economic value of fusion energy, and supporting an accelerated path to adoption. We calculate the value of this co-generation and derive a new economic breakeven condition based on net present value. At lower plasma gain, $Q_{\mathrm{plas}}\lesssim1-3$, high-value transmutation, such as medical radioisotopes, enables pure transmuter fusion systems operating at only a few megawatts of fusion power: for example, a 3 megawatt system transmuting ${}^{102}\mathrm{Ru}\rightarrow{}^{99}\mathrm{Mo}$ could fulfill global ${}^{99}\mathrm{Mo}$ demand with $Q_{\mathrm{plas}}\ll1$. At higher gain $Q_{\mathrm{plas}}\gtrsim3$, it becomes viable to generate electricity in addition to isotopes. For example, co-production of electricity and gold, transmuted from mercury in a fusion blanket, can reduce the required plasma gain for viability from $Q_{\mathrm{plas}}\sim10-100$ to $Q_{\mathrm{plas}}\sim3-5$. We further highlight techniques to enhance transmutation including magnetic mirrors, asymmetric neutron wall loading, and neutron multiplication. Fusion neutron-driven transmutation therefore offers a revenue-positive pathway for deploying fusion energy at terawatt-scale, starting from smaller megawatt-scale machines for radioisotope production and then scaling up to co-producing electricity and gold in larger fusion power plants.</description>

      <title>On How Zonal Fields Suppress Reversed Shear Alfv\'en Eigenmode in Tokamak Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing both nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations and theoretical analyses, we have discovered the novel result that, with energetic particle dynamics kept linear, the nonlinear suppression and eventual saturation of reversed-shear Alfv\'en eigenmode occur via the downward frequency chirping induced by the beat-driven zonal current. More specifically, as the mode frequency chirps downward, there is enhanced mode conversion to radially propagating electron Landau-damped kinetic Alfv\'en waves; resulting in enhanced convective (radiative) damping and, thereby, its suppression and saturation. Theoretical results are in good agreement with simulations both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Generation of Polarization-Tunable Hybrid Cylindrical Vector gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cylindrical vector (CV) gamma rays can introduce spatially structured polarization as a new degree of freedom for fundamental research and practical applications. However, their generation and control remain largely unexplored. Here, we put forward a novel method to generate CV gamma rays with tunable hybrid polarization via a rotating electron beam interacting with a solid foil. In this process, the beam generates a coherent transition radiation field and subsequently emits gamma rays through nonlinear Compton scattering. By manipulating the initial azimuthal momentum of the beam, the polarization angle of gamma rays relative to the transverse momentum can be controlled, yielding tunable hybrid CV polarization states. Three-dimensional spin-resolved particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate continuous tuning of the polarization angle across (-90{\deg}, 90{\deg}) with a high polarization degree exceeding 60%. Our work contributes to the development of structured gamma rays, potentially opening new avenues in high-energy physics, nuclear science, and laboratory astrophysics.</description>

      <title>A Propagator-based Multi-level Monte Carlo Method for Kinetic Neutral Species in Edge Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a new multi-level Monte Carlo scheme for numerical solutions of the kinetic Boltzmann equation for neutral species in edge plasmas. In particular, this method explicitly exploits a key structural property of neutral particle dynamics: the prevalence of frequent collisions for which the outgoing velocity is determined by local plasma parameters. Using this property, we derive a multi-level algorithm based on collision event propagator and show, both analytically and through numerical experiments, that it reproduces the results of standard Monte Carlo methods. We further demonstrate that, in the context of coupled plasma-neutral edge simulations employing correlated Monte Carlo, the proposed scheme retains trajectory correlation to machine precision as the system evolves, whereas conventional methods exhibit rapid decorrelation. These results indicate that the propagator-based multi-level Monte Carlo scheme is a promising candidate for use in fully implicit Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) solvers for coupled plasma-neutral systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an impulse dielectric barrier discharge in pure ammonia gas using electrical characteristics and imaging analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A glow nanosecond discharge from a plane-to-plane impulse dielectric barrier discharge (iDBD) with ammonia gas has been characterised by employing fast imaging and electrical diagnostics. More precisely, the aim of this study is to investigate the dynamics of the discharge establishment under various conditions of applied voltage, pressure, and gas gap. The comparison between the current measurements and the image analysis exposes a strong correlation between the fast excitation and ionization wave velocity and the rising current velocity. This correlation has been found only for diffuse mode discharge since a front wave could be clearly defined, denoted as the luminous propagation front (LPF). Furthermore, this correlation is supported by a proportionality factor of 1.5 10$^{-3}$ which is systematic over the studied conditions. Further investigations are considered to evaluate the relevance of such a value over more parameters.</description>

      <title>Surface Ion-Sound Wave in Magnetic Arch With High Pressure Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work analytically substantiates the parameters of the surface wave found in numerical modelling of the collision of two oncoming supersonic plasma flows inside a magnetic arc in application to the experiment on the laboratory setup ``Solar Wind'' (Inst. Appl. Phys RAS). An ion-acoustic surface wave exists in the regime of dense plasma flows when their dynamic pressure is of the order of the pressure of an undisturbed magnetic field, so that the flows push the initial magnetic field out of their volume. The wave frequency is in the range between the ion gyrofrequencies inside the plasma bundle and in the outer region of the confining magnetic field. In the external rarefied medium, the near-surface structure is a heterogeneous magnetic sound, consistent in pressure and low total polarisation of the medium with the ``isotropic'' ion sound confined from the inside in a dense plasma bundle. The energy of the structure is mainly contained in the kinetic energy of the wave motion of ions inside the tube. At the same time, the electric field strength is sharply increased outside. Firstly, the latter circumstance arises from the need to maintain a uniform electron electric drift velocity inside the transition layer. Secondly, the energetically weak ion sound propagating into the outer environment is close to electrostatic ion oscillations below the ion gyrofrequency in the external region, which are characterised by increased electric field strength across the ambient magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Density of hybrid plasma generated by microwave and laser radiation in the Ar:H2:CH4 mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheric-pressure hybrid plasma in the Ar:H2:CH4 mixture, maintained by microwave radiation (2.47 GHz) and CO2 laser radiation (10.6 {\mu}m) in the chamber of an experimental plasma-chemical reactor designed to study the synthesis of diamond-like coatings was studied. The electron number density was determined from the Stark broadening of the H{\alpha} line shape of atomic hydrogen. It was shown that when laser radiation is focused in the region of a microwave plasma bunch, the H{\alpha} line shape in the hybrid plasma spectra has broad wings and is described by a Lorentz function with a two-contour approximation. The complex structure of the H{\alpha} line profile of the hybrid plasma indicates its spatiotemporal inhomogeneity. The electron number density corresponding to the contour with a smaller half-width exceeds the electron number density in microwave plasma and lies in the range of (4-8)E15 cm-3, and the electron number density measured by the contour with a larger half-width is (1.5-2)E17 cm-3.</description>

      <title>Damped Kinetic Alfv\'en Waves in Earth's Magnetosheath: Numerical Simulations and MMS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth's magnetosheath provides a high $\beta$ (ratio of electron thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) plasma environment where kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAWs) strongly influence turbulence and energy dissipation. This study investigates how Landau damping modifies the nonlinear evolution of KAWs by solving a modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that captures both dispersive and nonlinear effects. Without Landau damping, modulational instability drives rapid self-focusing into intense magnetic filaments, producing a turbulent cascade with $k_\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling in the inertial range ($k_\perp\rho_i&lt;1$) that transitions to $k_\perp^{-8/3}$ at sub-ion scales ($k_\perp\rho_i&gt;1$), here $k_\perp$ is the wavevector component perpendicular to the background magnetic field and $\rho_i$ the ion thermal gyroradius. When Landau damping is included, magnetic structures are significantly suppressed, and the spectrum steepens to $k_\perp^{-11/3}$ in the sub-ion range while the inertial range maintains $k_\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling. The damping acts across all scales through resonant wave-particle interactions, efficiently transferring energy from waves to particles. Direct comparison with Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observations shows that the observed kinetic range spectral slope falls between our undamped and damped simulation limits, consistent with an intermediate damping regime in magnetosheath turbulence. This agreement confirms that Landau damping is one of the primary mechanisms controlling turbulent energy dissipation at kinetic scales in collisionless plasmas.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Black-Hole Coronae: QPOs, Turbulence, and Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variability of X-rays observed from accreting black hole systems, including quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), suggests a complex nonlinear dynamics in the corona. Here, we propose a new theoretical framework for this problem, based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In this model, coronal variability arises from feedback between a macroscopic oscillation of the plasma and the rate at which it is cooled by the inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from the disc. The "pair thermostat'' mechanism then allows the corona to act as a heat engine that extracts work cyclically from the underlying thermal disequilibrium between the low-entropy heating and the high-entropy cooling by the soft photons, in close analogy to the well-known $\kappa$-mechanism for pulsating stars. This coronal self-oscillation may explain QPOs without the need to invoke an external resonant driving. Moreover, we argue that this mechanism can provide the power to generate turbulence and jets in the corona.</description>

      <title>Tracing a Multi-Temperature Quiescent Prominence's Thermodynamic Evolution from Sun to Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar prominences are cool, dense stable structures routinely observed in the corona. Prominences are often ejected from the Sun via coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, they are rarely detected in a cool, low-ionized state within CMEs measured in situ, making their evolution hard to study. We examine the thermodynamic evolution of one of these rare cases where a quiescent prominence eruption clearly preserves its low-ionized charge state as evidenced by in situ detection. We use multi-viewpoint Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations to track and estimate the density, temperature and speed of the prominence as it erupts. We observe that part of the prominence remains in absorption well beyond initial liftoff, indicating the bulk of the prominence experiences minimal ionization and suggesting any strong heating is balanced by radiative losses, expansion, or conduction. From its subsequent in situ passage near 1au, charge states reveal that the prominence is composed of both cool, low-ionized ions as well as hotter plasma reflected by the presence of highly ionized iron, Fe$^{16+}$. Simulated non-equilibrium ionization and recombination results using observationally derived initial conditions match the in situ multi-thermal state for a prominence composed of 70% cool plasma with a 1.8MK peak temperature, and 30% hot plasma with a 4.3MK peak temperature. This suggests that the prominence may not be heated uniformly or that parts of it cools more rapidly. The complex, multi-thermal nature of this erupting prominence emphasizes the need for more comprehensive spectral observations of the global corona.</description>

      <title>Ultimate large-$Rm$ regime of the solar dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For more than fourty years, the quest to understand how large-scale magnetic fields emerge from turbulent flows in rotating astrophysical systems, such as the Sun, has been a major thread of computational astrophysics research. Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally-simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale nonlinear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm&gt;1$ and $Pm&lt;1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical setups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in a non-asymptotic turbulent MHD regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach this ultimate regime in such "realistic" global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-monoenergetic Deuteron Acceleration via Boosted Coulomb Explosion by Reflected Picosecond Laser Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generation of quasi-monoenergetic ions by intense laser is one of long-standing goals in laser-plasma physics. However, existing laser-driven ion acceleration schemes often produce broad energy spectra and limited control over ion species. Here we propose the acceleration mechanism, boosted Coulomb explosion, initiated by a standing wave, which is formed in a pre-expanded plasma by the interference between a continuously incoming main laser pulse and the pulse reflected by a solid target, where the pre-expanded plasma is formed from a thin layer on the solid target by a relatively strong pre-pulse. This mechanism produces a persistent Coulomb field on the target front side with field strengths on the order of TV/m for picoseconds. We experimentally demonstrate generation of quasi-monoenergetic deuterons up to 50 MeV using an in-situ D$_2$O-deposited target. Our results show that the peak energy can be tuned by the laser pulse duration.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Alfv\'en waves in the temperature anisotropic space plasma with a kappa-Maxwellian distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersion and damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves are studied in temperature anisotropic space plasma with kappa-Maxwellian distribution. Employing a kinetic approach, the wave frequency and damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves and the modified ion acoustic waves are derived in a low \b{eta} plasma, which both depend on the parameters \k{appa} and . The numerical analyses show that the wave frequency of kinetic Alfv\'en waves is larger in kappa-Maxwellian plasma than that in Maxwellian case. The wave frequency of the modified ion acoustic waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is larger in the short-wave region but smaller in the long-wave region than that in Maxwellian case. Again, we found that the damping rate of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is stronger than that in Maxwellian case. The damping rate of modified ion acoustic waves in kappa-Maxwellian plasma is stronger in the short-wave region but weaker in the long-wave region than that in Maxwellian case. The impact of the parameter on the two modes is relatively small because we consider the low \b{eta} case. These results are helpful for us to understand better the characteristics of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in space plasma.</description>

      <title>Firehose instability in the space plasma with anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the electron firehose mode propagating parallel to the ambient magnetic field in the space plasma with anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons. The dispersion relation, the wave frequency and the growth rate of electron firehose mode are derived, and the condition for onset of the firehose instability is obtained. We show that the wave frequency and the growth rate both depend significantly on the parameters, such as the parallel electron beta , the nonthermal parameter {\Lambda} and the electron temperature anisotropy Ae , and the anisotropic Cairns-distribution electrons change the instability condition. The numerical analyses show that the wave frequency and the growth rate of the electron firehose mode increase with increase of the parameters. The results may be helpful for understanding the firehose instability in space plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Ion-acoustic shock and solitary waves in magnetized plasma with Cairns-Gurevich distribution electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation properties of ion-acoustic solitary and shock waves in the magnetized viscous plasma with nonthermal trapped electrons are investigated. The Cairns-Gurevich distribution as the electron distribution is considered to describe the plasma nonthermality and particle trapping. By adopting the reductive perturbation technique, we derived the nonlinear Schamel-Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (SKdVB) equation, and then obtained the ion-acoustic shock and solitary wave solutions of the SKdVB equation for different limiting cases. It is found that the impact of nonthermal parameter {\alpha}, external magnetic field {\Omega}, obliqueness lz, wave speed U0, and the ion kinematic viscosity {\eta}0 can significantly change the characteristics of the shock and solitary waves. These results may be useful for better understanding the propagation of nonlinear structures in space (i.e. Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere, auroral regions) and laboratory plasma with nonthermal trapped electrons.</description>

      <title>Bell Instability and Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in AGN Ultrafast Outflow Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid (NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.</description>

      <title>Entity -- Hardware-agnostic Particle-in-Cell Code for Plasma Astrophysics. I: Curvilinear Special Relativistic Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entity is a new-generation, fully open-source particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed to overcome key limitations in astrophysical plasma modeling, particularly the extreme separation of scales and the performance challenges associated with evolving, GPU-centric computing infrastructures. It achieves hardware-agnostic performance portability across various GPU and CPU architectures using the Kokkos library. Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries.</description>

      <title>Self-similar multishock implosions for ultrahigh compression of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a class of self-similar solutions describing ultrahigh compression of a uniform-density target by spherically converging, stacked shock waves. Extending the classical Guderley model, we derive a scaling law for the final density of the form $\rho_{r}/\rho_{0} \propto \hat{P}^{\beta (N-1)}$, where $N$ is the number of shocks, $\hat{P}$ the stage pressure ratio, and $\beta$ a numerical exponent determined by the adiabatic index $\gamma$. One-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations confirm the validity of this scaling across a broad parameter range. Notably, the relation remains accurate even in the strongly nonlinear regime up to $\hat{P} \sim 70$, well beyond the perturbative limit, highlighting the robustness and practical relevance of the model. Owing to its volumetric geometry, this compression scheme inherently avoids the Rayleigh--Taylor instability, which typically compromises shell-based implosions, and thereby establishes a theoretical benchmark for instability-free compression in inertial confinement fusion.</description>
