      <title>Non-singular geodesic orbit nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Riemannian manifold is called a geodesic orbit manifolds, GO for short, if any geodesic is an orbit of a one-parameter group of isometries. By a result of C.Gordon, a non-flat GO nilmanifold is necessarily a two-step nilpotent Lie group with a left-invariant metric. We give a complete classification of non-singular GO nilmanifolds. Besides previously known examples, there are new families with 3-dimensional center, and two one-parameter families of dimensions 14 and 15.</description>

      <title>Sublinearly Morseness in Higher Rank Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop a theory of "sublinearly Morse boundary" and prove a corresponding sublinearly Morse lemma in higher rank symmetric space of non-compact type. This is motivated by the work of Kapovich-Leeb-Porti and the theory of sublinearly Morse quasi-geodesics developed in the context of CAT(0) geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss the stability of the pluriclosed flow and generalized Ricci flow. We proved that if the second variation of generalized Einstein--Hilbert functional is nonpositive and the infinitesimal deformations are integrable, the flow is dynamically stable. Moreover, we prove that the pluriclosed steady solitons are dynamically stable when the first Chern class vanishes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a complete classification of ruled zero mean curvature surfaces in the three-dimensional light cone. En route, we examine geodesics and screw motions in the space form, allowing us to discover helicoids. We also consider their relationship to catenoids using Weierstrass representations of zero mean curvature surfaces in the three-dimensional light cone.</description>

      <title>The Hard Lefschetz Theorem on K\"ahler Lie Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact K\"ahler manifolds classically satisfy the Hard Lefschetz Theorem, which gives strong control on the underlying topology of the manifold. One expects a similar theorem to be true for K\"ahler Lie Algebroids, and we show for a certain class of them that this is indeed true, with an added ellipticity requirement. We provide examples of Lie Algebroids satisfying this, as well as an example of a K\"ahler Lie Algebroid that does not meet this Ellipticity requirement, and consequently fails to satisfy the Hard Lefschetz condition.</description>

      <title>On Invariant Conjugate Symmetric Statistical Structures on the Space of Zero-Mean Multivariate Normal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the results of Furuhata--Inoguchi--Kobayashi [Inf. Geom. (2021)] and Kobayashi--Ohno [Osaka Math. J. (2025)], the Amari--Chentsov $\alpha$-connections on the space $\mathcal{N}$ of all $n$-variate normal distributions are uniquely characterized by the invariance under the transitive action of the affine transformation group among all conjugate symmetric statistical connections with respect to the Fisher metric. In this paper, we investigate the Amari--Chentsov $\alpha$-connections on the submanifold $\mathcal{N}_0$ consisting of zero-mean $n$-variate normal distributions. It is known that $\mathcal{N}_0$ admits a natural transitive action of the general linear group $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$-invariant conjugate symmetric statistical connections on $\mathcal{N}_0$ with respect to the Fisher metric and the space of homogeneous cubic real symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables. As a consequence, if $n \geq 2$, we show that the Amari--Chentsov $\alpha$-connections on $\mathcal{N}_0$ are not uniquely characterized by the invariance under the $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$-action among all conjugate symmetric statistical connections with respect to the Fisher metric. Furthermore, we show that any invariant statistical structure on a Riemannian symmetric space is necessarily conjugate symmetric.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the moduli space of Hermitian-Einstein connections on manifolds with a dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the moduli space of Hermitian-Einstein connections $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ of vector bundles over compact non-Gauduchon Hermitian manifolds $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$ that exhibit a dilaton field $\Phi$ admit a strong K\"ahler with torsion structure provided a certain condition is imposed on their Lee form $\theta$ and the dilaton. We find that the geometries that satisfy this condition include those that solve the string field equations or equivalently the gradient flow soliton type of equations. In addition, we demonstrate that if the underlying manifold $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$ admits a holomorphic and Killing vector field $X$ that leaves $\Phi$ also invariant, then the moduli spaces $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ admits an induced holomorphic and Killing vector field $\alpha_X$. Furthermore, if $X$ is covariantly constant with respect to the compatible connection $\hat\nabla$ with torsion a 3-form on $(M^{2n}, g, \omega)$, then $\alpha_X$ is also covariantly constant with respect to the compatible connection $\hat D$ with torsion a 3-form on $\text{M}^*_{HE}(M^{2n})$ provided that $K^\flat\wedge X^\flat$ is a $(1,1)$-form with $K^\flat=\theta+2d\Phi$ and $\Phi$ is invariant under $X$ and $IX$, where $I$ is the complex structure of $M^{2n}$.</description>

      <title>Minimal isometric immersions of flat n-tori into spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1985, Bryant stated that a flat $2$-torus admits a minimal isometric immersion into some round sphere if and only if it satisfies a certain rationality condition. We extend this rationality criterion to arbitrary dimensional flat tori, providing a sufficient condition for minimal isometric immersions of flat $n$-tori. For the case $n=3$, we prove that if a flat $3$-torus admits a minimal isometric immersion into some sphere, then its algebraic irrationality degree must be no more than 4, and we construct explicit embedded minimal irrational flat $3$-tori realizing each possible degree. Furthermore, we establish the upper bound $n^2+n-1$ for the minimal target dimension of flat $n$-tori admitting minimal isometric immersions into spheres.</description>

      <title>Compact K\"{a}hler manifolds with partially semi-positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a structure theorem for a compact K\"{a}hler manifold $X$ of rational dimension $\mathrm{rd}(X)\leq n-k$ under the mixed partially semi-positive curvature condition $\mathcal{S}_{a,b,k} \geq 0$, which is introduced as a unified framework for addressing two partially semi-positive curvature conditions -- namely, $k$-semi-positive Ricci curvature and semi-positive $k$-scalar curvature. As a main corollary, we show that a compact K\"{a}hler manifold $(X,g)$ with $k$-semi-positive Ricci curvature and $\mathrm{rd}(X)\leq n-k$ actually has semi-positive Ricci curvature and $\mathrm{rd}(X)\geq \nu(-K_X)$. Of independent interest, we also confirm the rational connectedness of compact K\"{a}hler manifolds with positive orthogonal Ricci curvature, among other results.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue distribution in gaps of the essential spectrum of the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator $H_{p}=\frac 1p\Delta^{L^p}+V$ on high tensor powers $L^p$ of a Hermitian line bundle $L$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$ of bounded geometry is studied under the assumption of non-degeneracy of the curvature form of $L$. For large $p$, the spectrum of $H_p$ asymptotically coincides with the union of all local Landau levels of the operator at the points of $X$. Moreover, if the union of the local Landau levels over the complement of a compact subset of $X$ has a gap, then the spectrum of $H_{p}$ in the gap is discrete. The main result of the paper is the trace asymptotics formula associated with these eigenvalues. As a consequence, we get a Weyl type asymptotic formula for the eigenvalue counting function.</description>

      <title>Extremal Lagrangian tori in toric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a closed Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold $(X,\omega)$. Cieliebak and Mohnke define the symplectic area of $L$ as the minimal positive symplectic area of a smooth $2$-disk in $X$ with boundary on $L$. An extremal Lagrangian torus in $(X,\omega)$ is a Lagrangian torus that maximizes the symplectic area among the Lagrangian tori in $(X,\omega)$. We prove that every extremal Lagrangian torus in the symplectic unit ball $(\bar{B}^{2n}(1),\omega_{\mathrm{std}})$ is contained entirely in the boundary $\partial B^{2n}(1)$. This answers a question attributed to Lazzarini and completely settles a conjecture of Cieliebak and Mohnke in the affirmative. In addition, we prove the conjecture for a class of toric domains in $(\mathbb{C}^n, \omega_{\mathrm{std}})$, which includes all compact strictly convex four-dimensional toric domains. We explain with counterexamples that the general conjecture does not hold for non-convex domains.</description>

      <title>Classical limit of the geometric Langlands correspondence for $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to give an explicit description of the integrable structure of the Hitchin moduli spaces. This is done by introducing explicit parameterisations for the different strata of the Hitchin moduli spaces, and by adapting the Separation of Variables method from the theory of integrable models to the Hitchin moduli spaces. The resulting description exhibits a clear analogy with Drinfeld's first construction of the geometric Langlands correspondence. It can be seen as a classical limit of a version of Drinfeld's construction which is adapted to the complex number field.</description>

Abstract: Non K\"ahler Calabi Yau theory is a newly developed subject and it arises naturally in mathematical physics and generalized geometry. The relevant geometrics are pluriclosed metrics which are critical points of the generalized Einstein Hilbert action. In this work, we study the critical points of the generalized Einstein Hilbert action and discuss the stability of critical points which are defined as pluriclosed steady solitons. We proved that all Bismut Hermitian Einstein manifolds are linearly stable which generalizes the work from Tian, Zhu, Hall, Murphy and Koiso In addition, all Bismut flat pluriclosed steady solitons with positive Ricci curvature are linearly strictly stable.</description>

      <title>Small separators, upper bounds for $l^\infty$-widths, and systolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dependence on the dimension in the inequalities that relate the Euclidean volume of a closed submanifold $M^n\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with its $l^\infty$-width $W^{l^\infty}_{n-1}(M^n)$ defined as the infimum over all continuous maps $\phi:M^n\longrightarrow K^{n-1}\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ of $sup_{x\in M^n}\Vert \phi(x)-x\Vert_{l^\infty}$. We prove that $W^{l^\infty}_{n-1}(M^n)\leq const\ \sqrt{n}\ vol(M^n)^{\frac{1}{n}}$, and if the codimension $N-n$ is equal to $1$, then $W^{l^\infty}_{n-1}(M^n)\leq \sqrt{3}\ vol(M^n)^{\frac{1}{n}}$.
  As a corollary, we prove that if $M^n\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is {\it essential}, then there exists a non-contractible closed curve on $M^n$ contained in a cube in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with side length $const\ \sqrt{n}\ vol^{\frac{1}{n}}(M^n)$ with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. If the codimension is $1$, then the side length of the cube is $4\ vol^{\frac{1}{n}}(M^n)$.
  To prove these results we introduce a new approach to systolic geometry that can be described as a non-linear version of the classical Federer-Fleming argument, where we push out from a specially constructed non-linear $(N-n)$-dimensional complex in $\mathbb{R}^N$ that does not intersect $M^n$. To construct these complexes we first prove a version of kinematic formula where one averages over isometries of $l^N_\infty$ (Theorem 3.5), and introduce high-codimension analogs of optimal foams recently discovered in [KORW] and [AK].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper has two purposes. The first is to classify all those versions of the Toda equations which govern the existence of $\tau$-primitive harmonic maps from a surface into a homogeneous space $G/T$ for which $G$ is a noncomplex noncompact simple real Lie group, $\tau$ is the Coxeter automorphism which Drinfel'd \&amp; Sokolov assigned to each affine Dynkin diagram, and $T$ is the compact torus fixed pointwise by $\tau$. Here $\tau$ may be either an inner or an outer automorphism. We interpret the Toda equations over a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ as equations for a metric on a holomorphic principal $T^\mathbb{C}$-bundle $Q^\mathbb{C}$ over $\Sigma$ whose Chern connection, when combined with holomorphic field $\varphi$, produces a $G$-connection which is flat precisely when the Toda equations hold. The second purpose is to establish when stability criteria for the pair $(Q^\mathbb{C},\varphi)$ can be used to prove the existence of solutions. We classify those real forms of the Toda equations for which this pair is a principal pair and we call these \emph{totally noncompact} Toda pairs: stability theory then gives algebraic conditions for the existence of solutions. Every solution to the geometric Toda equations has a corresponding $G$-Higgs bundle. We explain how to construct this $G$-Higgs bundle directly from the Toda pair and show that Baraglia's cyclic Higgs bundles arise from a very special case of totally noncompact cyclic Toda pairs.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature rigidity of parabolically convex domains in hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a parabolically convex domain $M\subseteq \mathbb{H}^n$, $n\ge 3$, we prove that if $f:(N,\bar g)\to (M,g)$ has nonzero degree, where $N$ is spin with scalar curvature $R_N\ge -n(n-1)$, and if $f|_{\partial N}$ does not increase the distance and the mean curvature, then $N$ is hyperbolic, and $\partial N$ is isometric to $\partial M$. This is a partial generalization of Lott's result \cite{lott2021index} to negative lower bounds of scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>A Codimension Two Approach to the $\mathbb{S}^1$-Stability Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: J. Rosenberg's $\mathbb{S}^1$-stability conjecture states that a closed oriented manifold $X$ admits a positive scalar curvature metric iff $X\times \mathbb{S}^1$ admits a positive scalar curvature metric $h$. As pointed out by J. Rosenberg and others, there are known counterexamples in dimension four. We prove this conjecture whenever $h$ satisfies a geometric bound, depending only on the dimension of $ X $, which measures the discrepancy between $\partial_\theta\in T\mathbb{S}^1$ and the normal vector field to $X\times \{P\}$, for a fixed $P\in \mathbb{S}^1.$</description>

      <title>On some optimal inequalities for bi-slant submanifolds in metallic Riemannian space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive some important optimal relationships for bi-slant submanifolds in metallic Riemannian product space forms enriching the understanding of their geometric properties and deepening the connection between intrinsic and extrinsic curvature invariants. We establish generalized Wintgen inequality for bi-slant submanifolds in metallic Riemannian product space forms and discussed the equality case. Next we derive optimal inequalities involving $\delta$-invariants, also known as Chen-invariants and discuss the conditions for Chen ideal submanifolds. Further, we derive optimal relationships involving Ricci curvature and shape operator invariants along with the discussion about the equality cases. In the last section, we establish optimal inequalities involving generalized normalized $\delta$-Casorati curvatures for bi-slant submanifolds of metallic Riemannian product space form and discuss the conditions under which the equality holds. Furthermore, we examine how the main findings specialize to slant, semi-slant, hemi-slant, and semi-invariant submanifolds in metallic Riemannian product space forms, offering a better understanding of their geometric characteristics.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler information manifolds of signal processing filters in weighted Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.07746v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the framework of K\"ahler information manifolds for complex-valued signal processing filters by introducing weighted Hardy spaces and smooth transformations of transfer functions. We demonstrate that the Riemannian geometry induced from weighted Hardy norms for the smooth transformations of its transfer function is a K\"ahler manifold. In this setting, the K\"ahler potential of the linear system geometry corresponds to the squared weighted Hardy norm of the composite transfer function. With the inherent structure of K\"ahler manifolds, geometric quantities on the manifold of linear systems in weighted Hardy spaces can be computed more efficiently and elegantly. Moreover, this generalized framework unifies a variety of well-known information manifolds within the structure of K\"ahler information manifolds for signal filters. Several illustrative examples from time series models are provided, wherein the metric tensor, Levi-Civita connection, and K\"ahler potentials are explicitly expressed in terms of polylogarithmic functions of the poles and zeros of transfer functions parameterized by weight vectors.</description>

      <title>Five tori in $S^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03460v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ivansic proved that there is a link $L$ of five tori in $S^4$ with hyperbolic complement. We describe $L$ explicitly with pictures, study its properties, and discover that $L$ is in many aspects similar to the Borromean rings in $S^3$. In particular the following hold: (1) Any two tori in $L$ are unlinked, but three are not; (2) The complement $M = S^4 \setminus L$ is integral arithmetic hyperbolic; (3) The symmetry group of $L$ acts $k$-transitively on its components for all $k$; (4) The double branched covering over $L$ has geometry $\mathbb H^2 \times \mathbb H^2$; (5) The fundamental group of $M$ has a nice presentation via commutators; (6) The Alexander ideal has an explicit simple description; (7) Every class $x \in H^1(M,Z) = Z^5$ with non-zero xi is represented by a perfect circle-valued Morse function; (8) By longitudinal Dehn surgery along $L$ we get a closed 4-manifold with fundamental group $Z^5$; (9) The link $L$ can be put in perfect position. This leads also to the first descriptions of a cusped hyperbolic 4-manifold as a complement of tori in $\mathbb{RP}^4$ and as a complement of some explicit Lagrangian tori in the product of two surfaces of genus two.</description>

      <title>A note on traces for the Heisenberg calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we gave a local formula for the index of Heisenberg elliptic operators on contact manifolds. We constructed a cocycle in periodic cyclic cohomology which, when paired with the Connes-Chern character of the principal Heisenberg symbol, calculates the index. A crucial ingredient of our index formula was a new trace on the algebra of Heisenberg pseudodifferential operators. The construction of this trace was rather involved. In the present paper, we clarify the nature of this trace.</description>

      <title>Bondi Mass, Memory Effect and Balance Law of Polyhomogeneous Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of a combination of powers of 1/r and ln r are known as polyhomogeneous spacetimes. The asymptotic behaviour of the Newman-Penrose quantities for these spacetimes is presented under certain gauges. The Bondi mass is revisited via the Iyer-Wald formalism. The memory effect of the gravitational radiation in the polyhomogeneous spacetimes is also discussed. It is found that the appearance of the logarithmic terms does not affect the balance law and it remains unchanged as the one of spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of powers of 1/r.</description>
