      <title>Mean-Field-Type Game Theory with Rosenblatt Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the integration of Rosenblatt noise into stochastic systems, control theory, and mean-field-type game theory, addressing the limitations of traditional Gaussian and Markovian models. Empirical evidence from various domains, including water demand, e-commerce, power grid operations, wireless channels, and agricultural supply chains, demonstrates the prevalence of non-Gaussian characteristics such as skews, heavy tails and strong long-range dependencies. The Rosenblatt process, a non-Gaussian non-Markovian, self-similar process, offers a baseline framework for capturing some the behaviors observed in real data. We develop novel stochastic calculus formulas for Rosenblatt processes, apply these to dynamical systems, and analyze optimal control problems, revealing the suboptimality of traditional noise approximation methods. We extend game-theoretic analysis to environments driven by Rosenblatt noise, establishing conditions for saddle-point equilibria in zero-sum games and identifying state-feedback Nash equilibria in non-zero-sum games. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating non-Gaussian noise into predictive analytics and control strategies, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of models in real-world applications. These findings represent a significant advancement in mean-field-type game theory with variance-awareness, offering new insights and tools for managing interactive systems influenced by Rosenblatt noise.</description>

      <title>Learning to Lead: Incentivizing Strategic Agents in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an online learning version of the generalized principal-agent model, where a principal interacts repeatedly with a strategic agent possessing private types, private rewards, and taking unobservable actions. The agent is non-myopic, optimizing a discounted sum of future rewards and may strategically misreport types to manipulate the principal's learning. The principal, observing only her own realized rewards and the agent's reported types, aims to learn an optimal coordination mechanism that minimizes strategic regret. We develop the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for this challenging setting. Our approach features a novel pipeline that combines (i) a delaying mechanism to incentivize approximately myopic agent behavior, (ii) an innovative reward angle estimation framework that uses sector tests and a matching procedure to recover type-dependent reward functions, and (iii) a pessimistic-optimistic LinUCB algorithm that enables the principal to explore efficiently while respecting the agent's incentive constraints. We establish a near optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ regret bound for learning the principal's optimal policy, where $\tilde{O}(\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. Our results open up new avenues for designing robust online learning algorithms for a wide range of game-theoretic settings involving private types and strategic agents.</description>

      <title>Epistemic vs. Counterfactual Fairness in Allocation of Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04574v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resource allocation is fundamental to a variety of societal decision-making settings, ranging from the distribution of charitable donations to assigning limited public housing among interested families. A central challenge in this context is ensuring fair outcomes, which often requires balancing conflicting preferences of various stakeholders. While extensive research has been conducted on theoretical and algorithmic solutions within the fair division framework, much of this work neglects the subjective perception of fairness by individuals. This study focuses on the fairness notion of envy-freeness (EF), which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent according to their own preferences. While the existence of exact EF allocations may not always be feasible, various approximate relaxations, such as counterfactual and epistemic EF, have been proposed. Through a series of experiments with human participants, we compare perceptions of fairness between three widely studied counterfactual and epistemic relaxations of EF. Our findings indicate that allocations based on epistemic EF are perceived as fairer than those based on counterfactual relaxations. Additionally, we examine a variety of factors, including scale, balance of outcomes, and cognitive effort involved in evaluating fairness and their role in the complexity of reasoning across treatments.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics of any multiplayer game on regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplayer games on graphs are at the heart of theoretical descriptions of key evolutionary processes that govern vital social and natural systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we solve this by drawing an analogy with the Balls-and-Boxes problem, based on which we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time. As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population. Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Continuous Structure: Utilizing the First-order Approach in Online Contract Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the online contract design problem. The principal's goal is to learn the optimal contract that maximizes her utility through repeated interactions, without prior knowledge of the agent's type (i.e., the agent's cost and production functions). We leverage the structure provided by continuous action spaces, which allows the application of first-order conditions (FOC) to characterize the agent's behavior. In some cases, we utilize conditions from the first-order approach (FOA) in economics, but in certain settings, we are able to apply FOC without additional assumptions, leading to simpler and more principled algorithms.
  We illustrate this approach in three problem settings. Firstly, we study the problem of learning the optimal contract when there can be many outcomes. In contrast to prior works that design highly specialized algorithms, we show that the problem can be directly reduced to Lipschitz bandits. Secondly, we study the problem of learning linear contracts. While the contracting problem involves hidden action (moral hazard) and the pricing problem involves hidden value (adverse selection), the two problems share a similar optimization structure, which enables direct reduction between the problem of learning linear contracts and dynamic pricing. Thirdly, we study the problem of learning contracts with many outcomes when agents are identical and provide an algorithm with polynomial sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Bridging Theory and Perception in Fair Division: A Study on Comparative and Fair Share Notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The allocation of resources among multiple agents is a fundamental problem in both economics and computer science. In these settings, fairness plays a crucial role in ensuring social acceptability and practical implementation of resource allocation algorithms. Traditional fair division solutions have given rise to a variety of approximate fairness notions, often as a response to the challenges posed by non-existence or computational intractability of exact solutions. However, the inherent incompatibility among these notions raises a critical question: which concept of fairness is most suitable for practical applications? In this paper, we examine two broad frameworks -- threshold-based and comparison-based fairness notions -- and evaluate their perceived fairness through a comprehensive human subject study. Our findings uncover novel insights into the interplay between perception of fairness, theoretical guarantees, the role of externalities and subjective valuations, and underlying cognitive processes, shedding light on the theory and practice of fair division.</description>

      <title>An $O(\log \log n)$-approximate budget feasible mechanism for subadditive valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In budget-feasible mechanism design, there is a set of items $U$, each owned by a distinct seller. The seller of item $e$ incurs a private cost $\overline{c}_e$ for supplying her item. A buyer wishes to procure a set of items from the sellers of maximum value, where the value of a set $S\subseteq U$ of items is given by a valuation function $v:2^U\to \mathbb{R}_+$. The buyer has a budget of $B \in \mathbb{R}_+$ for the total payments made to the sellers. We wish to design a mechanism that is truthful, that is, sellers are incentivized to report their true costs, budget-feasible, that is, the sum of the payments made to the sellers is at most the budget $B$, and that outputs a set whose value is large compared to $\text{OPT}:=\max\{v(S):\overline{c}(S)\le B,S\subseteq U\}$.
  Budget-feasible mechanism design has been extensively studied, with the literature focussing on (classes of) subadditive valuation functions, and various polytime, budget-feasible mechanisms, achieving constant-factor approximation, have been devised for the special cases of additive, submodular, and XOS valuations. However, for general subadditive valuations, the best-known approximation factor achievable by a polytime budget-feasible mechanism (given access to demand oracles) was only $O(\log n / \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of items.
  We improve this state-of-the-art significantly by designing a randomized budget-feasible mechanism for subadditive valuations that achieves a substantially-improved approximation factor of $O(\log\log n)$ and runs in polynomial time, given access to demand oracles.</description>

      <title>Instant Runoff Voting and the Reinforcement Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the susceptibility of instant runoff voting (IRV) to a lesser-studied paradox known as a reinforcement paradox, which occurs when candidate X wins under IRV in two distinct elections but X loses in the combined election formed by merging the ballots from the two elections. For three-candidate IRV elections we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which there exists a partition of the ballot set into two sets of ballots such that a given losing candidate wins each of the sub-elections. Using these conditions, we use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the frequency with which such partitions exist under various models of voter behavior. We also analyze the frequency with which the paradox occurs in a large dataset of real-world ranked-choice elections to provide empirical probabilities. Our general finding is that IRV is highly susceptible to this paradox in three-candidate elections.</description>
