      <title>On the ERM Principle in Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classic supervised learning involves algorithms trained on $n$ labeled examples to produce a hypothesis $h \in \mathcal{H}$ aimed at performing well on unseen examples. Meta-learning extends this by training across $n$ tasks, with $m$ examples per task, producing a hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ within some meta-class $\mathbb{H}$. This setting applies to many modern problems such as in-context learning, hypernetworks, and learning-to-learn. A common method for evaluating the performance of supervised learning algorithms is through their learning curve, which depicts the expected error as a function of the number of training examples. In meta-learning, the learning curve becomes a two-dimensional learning surface, which evaluates the expected error on unseen domains for varying values of $n$ (number of tasks) and $m$ (number of training examples).
  Our findings characterize the distribution-free learning surfaces of meta-Empirical Risk Minimizers when either $m$ or $n$ tend to infinity: we show that the number of tasks must increase inversely with the desired error. In contrast, we show that the number of examples exhibits very different behavior: it satisfies a dichotomy where every meta-class conforms to one of the following conditions: (i) either $m$ must grow inversely with the error, or (ii) a \emph{finite} number of examples per task suffices for the error to vanish as $n$ goes to infinity. This finding illustrates and characterizes cases in which a small number of examples per task is sufficient for successful learning. We further refine this for positive values of $\varepsilon$ and identify for each $\varepsilon$ how many examples per task are needed to achieve an error of $\varepsilon$ in the limit as the number of tasks $n$ goes to infinity. We achieve this by developing a necessary and sufficient condition for meta-learnability using a bounded number of examples per domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isometry pursuit is a convex algorithm for identifying orthonormal column-submatrices of wide matrices. It consists of a novel normalization method followed by multitask basis pursuit. Applied to Jacobians of putative coordinate functions, it helps identity isometric embeddings from within interpretable dictionaries. We provide theoretical and experimental results justifying this method. For problems involving coordinate selection and diversification, it offers a synergistic alternative to greedy and brute force search.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Defense Against the Winner's Curse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across science and policy, decision-makers often need to draw conclusions about the best candidate among competing alternatives. For instance, researchers may seek to infer the effectiveness of the most successful treatment or determine which demographic group benefits most from a specific treatment. Similarly, in machine learning, practitioners are often interested in the population performance of the model that performs best empirically. However, cherry-picking the best candidate leads to the winner's curse: the observed performance for the winner is biased upwards, rendering conclusions based on standard measures of uncertainty invalid. We introduce the zoom correction, a novel approach for valid inference on the winner. Our method is flexible: it can be employed in both parametric and nonparametric settings, can handle arbitrary dependencies between candidates, and automatically adapts to the level of selection bias. The method easily extends to important related problems, such as inference on the top k winners, inference on the value and identity of the population winner, and inference on "near-winners."</description>

      <title>Functional relevance based on the continuous Shapley value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our society is increasing, which brings with it the need to understand the behaviour of AI mechanisms, including machine learning predictive algorithms fed with tabular data, text, or images, among other types of data. This work focuses on interpretability of predictive models based on functional data. Designing interpretability methods for functional data models implies working with a set of features whose size is infinite. In the context of scalar on function regression, we propose an interpretability method based on the Shapley value for continuous games, a mathematical formulation that allows to fairly distribute a global payoff among a continuous set players. The method is illustrated through a set of experiments with simulated and real data sets. The open source Python package ShapleyFDA is also presented.</description>

      <title>When Is Heterogeneity Actionable for Personalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Targeting and personalization policies can be used to improve outcomes beyond the uniform policy that assigns the best performing treatment in an A/B test to everyone. Personalization relies on the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effects, yet, as we show in this paper, heterogeneity alone is not sufficient for personalization to be successful. We develop a statistical model to quantify "actionable heterogeneity," or the conditions when personalization is likely to outperform the best uniform policy. We show that actionable heterogeneity can be visualized as crossover interactions in outcomes across treatments and depends on three population-level parameters: within-treatment heterogeneity, cross-treatment correlation, and the variation in average responses. Our model can be used to predict the expected gain from personalization prior to running an experiment and also allows for sensitivity analysis, providing guidance on how changing treatments can affect the personalization gain. To validate our model, we apply five common personalization approaches to two large-scale field experiments with many interventions that encouraged flu vaccination. We find an 18% gain from personalization in one and a more modest 4% gain in the other, which is consistent with our model. Counterfactual analysis shows that this difference in the gains from personalization is driven by a drastic difference in within-treatment heterogeneity. However, reducing cross-treatment correlation holds a larger potential to further increase personalization gains. Our findings provide a framework for assessing the potential from personalization and offer practical recommendations for improving gains from targeting in multi-intervention settings.</description>

      <title>Analytic Continuation by Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytic continuation aims to reconstruct real-time spectral functions from imaginary-time Green's functions; however, this process is notoriously ill-posed and challenging to solve. We propose a novel neural network architecture, named the Feature Learning Network (FL-net), to enhance the prediction accuracy of spectral functions, achieving an improvement of at least $20\%$ over traditional methods, such as the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), and previous neural network approaches. Furthermore, we develop an analytical method to evaluate the robustness of the proposed network. Using this method, we demonstrate that increasing the hidden dimensionality of FL-net, while leading to lower loss, results in decreased robustness. Overall, our model provides valuable insights into effectively addressing the complex challenges associated with analytic continuation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facing the thermal management challenges of Wide Bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, this study highlights the use of ARX parametric models, which provide accurate temperature predictions without requiring detailed understanding of component thickness disparities or material physical properties, relying solely on experimental measurements. These parametric models emerge as a reliable alternative to FEM simulations and conventional thermal models, significantly simplifying system identification while ensuring high result accuracy.</description>

      <title>Integrating Dual Prototypes for Task-Wise Adaption in Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to acquire new classes while conserving historical knowledge incrementally. Despite existing pre-trained model (PTM) based methods performing excellently in CIL, it is better to fine-tune them on downstream incremental tasks with massive patterns unknown to PTMs. However, using task streams for fine-tuning could lead to catastrophic forgetting that will erase the knowledge in PTMs. This paper proposes the Dual Prototype network for Task-wise Adaption (DPTA) of PTM-based CIL. For each incremental learning task, a task-wise adapter module is built to fine-tune the PTM, where the center-adapt loss forces the representation to be more centrally clustered and class separable. The dual prototype network improves the prediction process by enabling test-time adapter selection, where the raw prototypes deduce several possible task indexes of test samples to select suitable adapter modules for PTM, and the augmented prototypes that could separate highly correlated classes are utilized to determine the final result. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DPTA. The code will be open-sourced after the paper is published.</description>

      <title>Rate-Informed Discovery via Bayesian Adaptive Multifidelity Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires both accurate estimation of their performance and efficient discovery of potential failure cases. This paper introduces Bayesian adaptive multifidelity sampling (BAMS), which leverages the power of adaptive Bayesian sampling to achieve efficient discovery while simultaneously estimating the rate of adverse events. BAMS prioritizes exploration of regions with potentially low performance, leading to the identification of novel and critical scenarios that traditional methods might miss. Using real-world AV data we demonstrate that BAMS discovers 10 times as many issues as Monte Carlo (MC) and importance sampling (IS) baselines, while at the same time generating rate estimates with variances 15 and 6 times narrower than MC and IS baselines respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present empirical evidence that neural networks with ReLU and Absolute Value activations learn distance-based representations. We independently manipulate both distance and intensity properties of internal activations in trained models, finding that both architectures are highly sensitive to small distance-based perturbations while maintaining robust performance under large intensity-based perturbations. These findings challenge the prevailing intensity-based interpretation of neural network activations and offer new insights into their learning and decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Optimized Conformal Selection: Powerful Selective Inference After Conformity Score Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model selection/optimization in conformal inference is challenging, since it may break the exchangeability between labeled and unlabeled data. We study this problem in the context of conformal selection, which uses conformal p-values to select ``interesting'' instances with large unobserved labels from a pool of unlabeled data, while controlling the FDR in finite sample. For validity, existing solutions require the model choice to be independent of the data used to construct the p-values and calibrate the selection set. However, when presented with many model choices and limited labeled data, it is desirable to (i) select the best model in a data-driven manner, and (ii) mitigate power loss due to sample splitting.
  This paper presents OptCS, a general framework that allows valid statistical testing (selection) after flexible data-driven model optimization. We introduce general conditions under which OptCS constructs valid conformal p-values despite substantial data reuse and handles complex p-value dependencies to maintain finite-sample FDR control via a novel multiple testing procedure. We instantiate this general recipe to propose three FDR-controlling procedures, each optimizing the models differently: (i) selecting the most powerful one among multiple pre-trained candidate models, (ii) using all data for model fitting without sample splitting, and (iii) combining full-sample model fitting and selection. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods via simulation studies and real applications in drug discovery and alignment of large language models in radiology report generation.</description>

      <title>Causal and Local Correlations Based Network for Multivariate Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, time series classification has attracted the attention of a large number of researchers, and hundreds of methods have been proposed. However, these methods often ignore the spatial correlations among dimensions and the local correlations among features. To address this issue, the causal and local correlations based network (CaLoNet) is proposed in this study for multivariate time series classification. First, pairwise spatial correlations between dimensions are modeled using causality modeling to obtain the graph structure. Then, a relationship extraction network is used to fuse local correlations to obtain long-term dependency features. Finally, the graph structure and long-term dependency features are integrated into the graph neural network. Experiments on the UEA datasets show that CaLoNet can obtain competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Evaluation of Deep Learning-based Explainable Solar Flare Forecasting Models with Attribution-based Proximity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable predictions of solar flares are essential due to their potentially significant impact on Earth and space-based infrastructure. Although deep learning models have shown notable predictive capabilities in this domain, current evaluations often focus on accuracy while neglecting interpretability and reliability--factors that are especially critical in operational settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel proximity-based framework for analyzing post hoc explanations to assess the interpretability of deep learning models for solar flare prediction. Our study compares two models trained on full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram images to predict $\geq$M-class solar flares within a 24-hour window. We employ the Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) method to generate attribution maps from these models, which we then analyze to gain insights into their decision-making processes. To support the evaluation of explanations in operational systems, we introduce a proximity-based metric that quantitatively assesses the accuracy and relevance of local explanations when regions of interest are known. Our findings indicate that the models' predictions align with active region characteristics to varying degrees, offering valuable insights into their behavior. This framework enhances the evaluation of model interpretability in solar flare forecasting and supports the development of more transparent and reliable operational systems.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Closed Form of Expected Improvement for Gaussian Process Trained on Log-Transformed Objective</title>

Abstract: Expected Improvement (EI) is arguably the most widely used acquisition function in Bayesian optimization. However, it is often challenging to enhance the performance with EI due to its sensitivity to numerical precision. Previously, Hutter et al. (2009) tackled this problem by using Gaussian process trained on the log-transformed objective function and it was reported that this trick improves the predictive accuracy of GP, leading to substantially better performance. Although Hutter et al. (2009) offered the closed form of their EI, its intermediate derivation has not been provided so far. In this paper, we give a friendly derivation of their proposition.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Uncertainty and Personalization via Efficient Second-order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising method to collaboratively learn from decentralized and heterogeneous data available at different clients without the requirement of data ever leaving the clients. Recent works on FL have advocated taking a Bayesian approach to FL as it offers a principled way to account for the model and predictive uncertainty by learning a posterior distribution for the client and/or server models. Moreover, Bayesian FL also naturally enables personalization in FL to handle data heterogeneity across the different clients by having each client learn its own distinct personalized model. In particular, the hierarchical Bayesian approach enables all the clients to learn their personalized models while also taking into account the commonalities via a prior distribution provided by the server. However, despite their promise, Bayesian approaches for FL can be computationally expensive and can have high communication costs as well because of the requirement of computing and sending the posterior distributions. We present a novel Bayesian FL method using an efficient second-order optimization approach, with a computational cost that is similar to first-order optimization methods like Adam, but also provides the various benefits of the Bayesian approach for FL (e.g., uncertainty, personalization), while also being significantly more efficient and accurate than SOTA Bayesian FL methods (both for standard as well as personalized FL settings). Our method achieves improved predictive accuracies as well as better uncertainty estimates as compared to the baselines which include both optimization based as well as Bayesian FL methods.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic size-and-shape functional mixed models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable recovery and uncertainty quantification of a fixed effect function $\mu$ in a functional mixed model, for modelling population- and object-level variability in noisily observed functional data, is a notoriously challenging task: variations along the $x$ and $y$ axes are confounded with additive measurement error, and cannot in general be disentangled. The question then as to what properties of $\mu$ may be reliably recovered becomes important. We demonstrate that it is possible to recover the size-and-shape of a square-integrable $\mu$ under a Bayesian functional mixed model. The size-and-shape of $\mu$ is a geometric property invariant to a family of space-time unitary transformations, viewed as rotations of the Hilbert space, that jointly transform the $x$ and $y$ axes. A random object-level unitary transformation then captures size-and-shape \emph{preserving} deviations of $\mu$ from an individual function, while a random linear term and measurement error capture size-and-shape \emph{altering} deviations. The model is regularized by appropriate priors on the unitary transformations, posterior summaries of which may then be suitably interpreted as optimal data-driven rotations of a fixed orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space. Our numerical experiments demonstrate utility of the proposed model, and superiority over the current state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Multiple Choice Learning for Efficient Speech Separation with Many Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training speech separation models in the supervised setting raises a permutation problem: finding the best assignation between the model predictions and the ground truth separated signals. This inherently ambiguous task is customarily solved using Permutation Invariant Training (PIT). In this article, we instead consider using the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) framework, which was originally introduced to tackle ambiguous tasks. We demonstrate experimentally on the popular WSJ0-mix and LibriMix benchmarks that MCL matches the performances of PIT, while being computationally advantageous. This opens the door to a promising research direction, as MCL can be naturally extended to handle a variable number of speakers, or to tackle speech separation in the unsupervised setting.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Cumulative Reward in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the concentration properties of cumulative rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), focusing on both asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. We introduce a unified approach to characterize reward concentration in MDPs, covering both infinite-horizon settings (i.e., average and discounted reward frameworks) and finite-horizon setting. Our asymptotic results include the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and the law of iterated logarithms, while our non-asymptotic bounds include Azuma-Hoeffding-type inequalities and a non-asymptotic version of the law of iterated logarithms. Additionally, we explore two key implications of our results. First, we analyze the sample path behavior of the difference in rewards between any two stationary policies. Second, we show that two alternative definitions of regret for learning policies proposed in the literature are rate-equivalent. Our proof techniques rely on a novel martingale decomposition of cumulative rewards, properties of the solution to the policy evaluation fixed-point equation, and both asymptotic and non-asymptotic concentration results for martingale difference sequences.</description>

      <title>Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning with Linearly Structured $f$-Divergence Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Process (DRMDP) is a popular framework for addressing dynamics shift in reinforcement learning by learning policies robust to the worst-case transition dynamics within a constrained set. However, solving its dual optimization oracle poses significant challenges, limiting theoretical analysis and computational efficiency. The recently proposed Robust Regularized Markov Decision Process (RRMDP) replaces the uncertainty set constraint with a regularization term on the value function, offering improved scalability and theoretical insights. Yet, existing RRMDP methods rely on unstructured regularization, often leading to overly conservative policies by considering transitions that are unrealistic. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, the $d$-rectangular linear robust regularized Markov decision process ($d$-RRMDP), which introduces a linear latent structure into both transition kernels and regularization. For the offline RL setting, where an agent learns robust policies from a pre-collected dataset in the nominal environment, we develop a family of algorithms, Robust Regularized Pessimistic Value Iteration (R2PVI), employing linear function approximation and $f$-divergence based regularization terms on transition kernels. We provide instance-dependent upper bounds on the suboptimality gap of R2PVI policies, showing these bounds depend on how well the dataset covers state-action spaces visited by the optimal robust policy under robustly admissible transitions. This term is further shown to be fundamental to $d$-RRMDPs via information-theoretic lower bounds. Finally, numerical experiments validate that R2PVI learns robust policies and is computationally more efficient than methods for constrained DRMDPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.04209v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for estimation and inference for the broad class of universal approximators. Estimation is based on the decomposition of model predictions into Shapley values. Inference relies on analyzing the bias and variance properties of individual Shapley components. We show that Shapley value estimation is asymptotically unbiased, and we introduce Shapley regressions as a tool to uncover the true data generating process from noisy data alone. The well-known case of the linear regression is the special case in our framework if the model is linear in parameters. We present theoretical, numerical, and empirical results for the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects as our guiding example.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Neural Network Symmetrisation in Markov Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of symmetrising a neural network along a group homomorphism: given a homomorphism $\varphi : H \to G$, we would like a procedure that converts $H$-equivariant neural networks to $G$-equivariant ones. We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us to consider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but with measure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible and compositional framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptions about the structure of the group and the underlying neural network architecture. Our approach recovers existing canonicalisation and averaging techniques for symmetrising deterministic models, and extends to provide a novel methodology for symmetrising stochastic models also. Beyond this, our findings also demonstrate the utility of Markov categories for addressing complex problems in machine learning in a conceptually clear yet mathematically precise way.</description>

      <title>Markov Equivalence and Consistency in Differentiable Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers, thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.</description>

Abstract: This paper is in the field of stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs), i.e. those sequential selection techniques able to learn online using only the feedback given by the chosen option (a.k.a. $arm$). We study a particular case of the rested bandits in which the arms' expected reward is monotonically non-decreasing and concave. We study the inherent sample complexity of the regret minimization problem by deriving suitable regret lower bounds. Then, we design an algorithm for the rested case $\textit{R-ed-UCB}$, providing a regret bound depending on the properties of the instance and, under certain circumstances, of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$. We empirically compare our algorithms with state-of-the-art methods for non-stationary MABs over several synthetically generated tasks and an online model selection problem for a real-world dataset</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Centered Hybrid Data-Driven Multi-Stage Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Nuclear Reactor Power Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13157v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate and efficient modeling of nuclear reactor transients is crucial for ensuring safe and optimal reactor operation. Traditional physics-based models, while valuable, can be computationally intensive and may not fully capture the complexities of real-world reactor behavior. This paper introduces a novel hybrid digital twin-focused multi-stage deep learning framework that addresses these limitations, offering a faster and more robust solution for predicting the final steady-state power of reactor transients. By leveraging a combination of feed-forward neural networks with both classification and regression stages, and training on a unique dataset that integrates real-world measurements of reactor power and controls state from the Missouri University of Science and Technology Reactor (MSTR) with noise-enhanced simulated data, our approach achieves remarkable accuracy (96% classification, 2.3% MAPE). The incorporation of simulated data with noise significantly improves the model's generalization capabilities, mitigating the risk of overfitting. Designed as a digital twin supporting system, this framework integrates real-time, synchronized predictions of reactor state transitions, enabling dynamic operational monitoring and optimization. This innovative solution not only enables rapid and precise prediction of reactor behavior but also has the potential to revolutionize nuclear reactor operations, facilitating enhanced safety protocols, optimized performance, and streamlined decision-making processes. By aligning data-driven insights with the principles of digital twins, this work lays the groundwork for adaptable and scalable solutions in nuclear system management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit recent spectral GNN approaches to semi-supervised node classification (SSNC). We posit that state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN architectures may be over-engineered for common SSNC benchmark datasets (citation networks, page-page networks, etc.). By replacing feature aggregation with a non-parametric learner we are able to streamline the GNN design process and avoid many of the engineering complexities associated with SOTA hyperparameter selection (GNN depth, non-linearity choice, feature dropout probability, etc.). Our empirical experiments suggest conventional methods such as non-parametric regression are well suited for semi-supervised learning on sparse, directed networks and a variety of other graph types commonly found in SSNC benchmarks. Additionally, we bring attention to recent changes in evaluation conventions for SSNC benchmarking and how this may have partially contributed to rising performances over time.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Adaptive Teacher for Domain Adaptive Intelligent Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) based on deep learning has proven to be an effective and flexible solution, attracting extensive research. Deep neural networks can learn rich representations from vast amounts of representative labeled data for various applications. In IFD, they achieve high classification performance from signals in an end-to-end manner, without requiring extensive domain knowledge. However, deep learning models usually only perform well on the data distribution they have been trained on. When applied to a different distribution, they may experience performance drops. This is also observed in IFD, where assets are often operated in working conditions different from those in which labeled data have been collected. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) deals with the scenario where labeled data are available in a source domain, and only unlabeled data are available in a target domain, where domains may correspond to operating conditions. Recent methods rely on training with confident pseudo-labels for target samples. However, the confidence-based selection of pseudo-labels is hindered by poorly calibrated confidence estimates in the target domain, primarily due to over-confident predictions, which limits the quality of pseudo-labels and leads to error accumulation. In this paper, we propose a novel UDA method called Calibrated Adaptive Teacher (CAT), where we propose to calibrate the predictions of the teacher network throughout the self-training process, leveraging post-hoc calibration techniques. We evaluate CAT on domain-adaptive IFD and perform extensive experiments on the Paderborn benchmark for bearing fault diagnosis under varying operating conditions. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most transfer tasks.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Lane Rendering Using Transformer with Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Customized Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04398v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Linear quadratic control of nonlinear systems with Koopman operator learning and the Nystr\"om method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how the Koopman operator framework can be combined with kernel methods to effectively control nonlinear dynamical systems. While kernel methods have typically large computational requirements, we show how random subspaces (Nystr\"om approximation) can be used to achieve huge computational savings while preserving accuracy. Our main technical contribution is deriving theoretical guarantees on the effect of the Nystr\"om approximation. More precisely, we study the linear quadratic regulator problem, showing that the approximated Riccati operator converges at the rate $m^{-1/2}$, and the regulator objective, for the associated solution of the optimal control problem, converges at the rate $m^{-1}$, where $m$ is the random subspace size. Theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments corroborating our results.</description>

      <title>Universal Functional Regression with Neural Operator Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regression on function spaces is typically limited to models with Gaussian process priors. We introduce the notion of universal functional regression, in which we aim to learn a prior distribution over non-Gaussian function spaces that remains mathematically tractable for functional regression. To do this, we develop Neural Operator Flows (OpFlow), an infinite-dimensional extension of normalizing flows. OpFlow is an invertible operator that maps the (potentially unknown) data function space into a Gaussian process, allowing for exact likelihood estimation of functional point evaluations. OpFlow enables robust and accurate uncertainty quantification via drawing posterior samples of the Gaussian process and subsequently mapping them into the data function space. We empirically study the performance of OpFlow on regression and generation tasks with data generated from Gaussian processes with known posterior forms and non-Gaussian processes, as well as real-world earthquake seismograms with an unknown closed-form distribution.</description>

      <title>Tree species classification at the pixel-level using deep learning and multispectral time series in an imbalanced context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates tree species classification using Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite image time-series. Despite their critical importance for many applications, such maps are often unavailable, outdated, or inaccurate for large areas. The interest of using remote sensing time series to produce these maps has been highlighted in many studies. However, many methods proposed in the literature still rely on a standard classification algorithm, usually the Random Forest (RF) algorithm with vegetation indices. This study shows that the use of deep learning models can lead to a significant improvement in classification results, especially in an imbalanced context where the RF algorithm tends to predict towards the majority class. In our use case in the center of France with 10 tree species, we obtain an overall accuracy (OA) around 95% and a F1-macro score around 80% using three different benchmark deep learning architectures. In contrast, using the RF algorithm yields an OA of 93% and an F1 of 60%, indicating that the minority classes are not classified with sufficient accuracy. Therefore, the proposed framework is a strong baseline that can be easily implemented in most scenarios, even with a limited amount of reference data. Our results highlight that standard multilayer perceptron can be competitive with batch normalization and a sufficient amount of parameters. Other architectures (convolutional or attention-based) can also achieve strong results when tuned properly. Furthermore, our results show that DL models are naturally robust to imbalanced data, although similar results can be obtained using dedicated techniques.</description>

      <title>Simple Relative Deviation Bounds for Covariance and Gram Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide non-asymptotic, relative deviation bounds for the eigenvalues of empirical covariance and gram matrices in general settings. Unlike typical uniform bounds, which may fail to capture the behavior of smaller eigenvalues, our results provide sharper control across the spectrum. Our analysis is based on a general-purpose theorem that allows one to convert existing uniform bounds into relative ones. The theorems and techniques emphasize simplicity and should be applicable across various settings.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the successful use of scattering representations without further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e. field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As expected, we show that a scattering only approach extracts more information than traditional second order summary statistics.</description>

      <title>How Does Variance Shape the Regret in Contextual Bandits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider realizable contextual bandits with general function approximation, investigating how small reward variance can lead to better-than-minimax regret bounds. Unlike in minimax bounds, we show that the eluder dimension $d_\text{elu}$$-$a complexity measure of the function class$-$plays a crucial role in variance-dependent bounds. We consider two types of adversary:
  (1) Weak adversary: The adversary sets the reward variance before observing the learner's action. In this setting, we prove that a regret of $\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{A,d_\text{elu}\}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ is unavoidable when $d_{\text{elu}}\leq\sqrt{AT}$, where $A$ is the number of actions, $T$ is the total number of rounds, and $\Lambda$ is the total variance over $T$ rounds. For the $A\leq d_\text{elu}$ regime, we derive a nearly matching upper bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{A\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ for the special case where the variance is revealed at the beginning of each round.
  (2) Strong adversary: The adversary sets the reward variance after observing the learner's action. We show that a regret of $\Omega(\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ is unavoidable when $\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu}\leq\sqrt{AT}$. In this setting, we provide an upper bound of order $\tilde{O}(d_\text{elu}\sqrt{\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$.
  Furthermore, we examine the setting where the function class additionally provides distributional information of the reward, as studied by Wang et al. (2024). We demonstrate that the regret bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ established in their work is unimprovable when $\sqrt{d_{\text{elu}}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu}\leq\sqrt{AT}$. However, with a slightly different definition of the total variance and with the assumption that the reward follows a Gaussian distribution, one can achieve a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{A\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$.</description>

      <title>Heterophilic Graph Neural Networks Optimization with Causal Message-passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discover that causal inference provides a promising approach to capture heterophilic message-passing in Graph Neural Network (GNN). By leveraging cause-effect analysis, we can discern heterophilic edges based on asymmetric node dependency. The learned causal structure offers more accurate relationships among nodes. To reduce the computational complexity, we introduce intervention-based causal inference in graph learning. We first simplify causal analysis on graphs by formulating it as a structural learning model and define the optimization problem within the Bayesian scheme. We then present an analysis of decomposing the optimization target into a consistency penalty and a structure modification based on cause-effect relations. We then estimate this target by conditional entropy and present insights into how conditional entropy quantifies the heterophily. Accordingly, we propose CausalMP, a causal message-passing discovery network for heterophilic graph learning, that iteratively learns the explicit causal structure of input graphs. We conduct extensive experiments in both heterophilic and homophilic graph settings. The result demonstrates that the our model achieves superior link prediction performance. Training on causal structure can also enhance node representation in classification task across different base models.</description>
