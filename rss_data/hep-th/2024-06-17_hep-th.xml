      <title>On the inclusion of statistical matter in the non-relativistic limit of NS-NS supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine techniques from kinetic theory and string dualities to couple statistical matter to a non-relativistic (NR) supergravity background so that the theory can be reformulated in a T-duality invariant form. While in the relativistic case the many-strings system requires a viscous fluid to describe the statistical matter, the NR formulation of ST simplifies this issue and therefore the system can be described using the perfect fluid technology.</description>

      <title>PSALTer: Particle Spectrum for Any Tensor Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the PSALTer software for efficiently computing the mass and energy of the particle spectrum for any (e.g. higher-rank) tensor field theory in the Wolfram Language. The user must provide a Lagrangian density which is expanded quadratically in the fields around a Minkowski vacuum, is linear in the coupling coefficients, and otherwise built from the partial derivative and Minkowski metric. PSALTer automatically computes the spin-projection operators, saturated propagator, bare masses, residues of massive and massless poles and overall unitarity conditions in terms of the coupling coefficients. The constraints on the source currents and total number of gauge symmetries are produced as a by-product. We provide examples from scalar, vector, tensor and gauge theories of gravity. Each example, including spectra of higher-spin modified gravity theories, may be obtained on a personal computer in a matter of minutes. The software is also parallelised for use on high-performance computing resources. The initial release allows for parity-preserving operators constructed from fields of up to rank three: this functionality will be extended in future versions. PSALTer is a contribution to the xAct project.</description>

      <title>Rest mass variation in Kaluza-Klein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geodesic motion in higher dimensions suggests that the 3D rest mass of test particles can vary in certain circumstances. This effect was originally noticed in the 5D Kaluza-Klein model but appeared as a difficulty of the theory, since mass variation is not observed in real electromagnetic interactions. Widening the perspective, this paper studies geodesic motion on $M_4 \times K$ in the presence of general gauge fields and Higgs-like scalar fields. This leads to a more general formula for mass variation. It also shows that a test particle's rest mass can change only in precise circumstances. Namely, when the geodesic traverses regions of spacetime where massive gauge fields are present or where the Higgs-like scalars are not constant. This agrees with the physical fact that interactions mediated by massive bosons are able to change the rest mass of particles. Thus, it offers a natural physical interpretation of the phenomenon of geodesic mass variation in Kaluza-Klein models.</description>

      <title>Interpolating gauge-fixing for Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in D=3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in three-dimensional Minkowski space-time is studied in a gauge-fixing scheme which interpolates between the covariant gauge and light-cone gauge, the interpolating gauge-fixing. The ultraviolet finiteness of the theory is proved via the Becchi-Rouet-Stora (BRS) algebraic renormalization procedure, which allows us to demonstrate the vanishing of all $\beta$-functions and all anomalous dimensions to all orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>On the fidelity of information retrieval in the black hole final state model with scrambling interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fidelity of information retrieval in the black hole final state model by taking into account the interactions between the collapsing matter and the infalling Hawking radiation inside the event horizon. By utilizing a scrambling unitary operator to model these interactions, our direct calculations suggest that the information is almost lost during the process of black hole evaporation. We then proceed to employ the Yoshida-Kitaev decoding strategy for information retrieval. Although we observe a finite improvement in decoding fidelity, it does not reach unity. This indicates that the issue of unitarity in black hole evaporation may not be fully resolved within the framework of the final state model.</description>

      <title>Swampland Bounds on Magnetized Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a six-dimensional $U(1)$ gauge theory compactified on two-dimensional manifolds. The number of chiral fermions is determined by the flux quantization number on the two-dimensional compact manifolds. Using the Swampland Conjectures, we find constraints among the parameters of the theory: the flux quantization number, the compactification scale, and the string scale. Specifically, the Weak Gravity Conjecture and the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture give non-trivial bounds.</description>

      <title>Regularising Spectral Curves for Homogeneous Yang-Baxter strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study the semi-classical spectrum of integrable worldsheet $\sigma$-models using the Spectral Curve. We consider a Homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformation of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, understood as the composition of a Jordanian with a "non-diagonal" TsT deformation. We derive its type IIB supergravity solution, whose isometry algebra features zero supercharges and a non-relativistic conformal algebra in $0+1$ dimensions. While the Spectral Curves of non-diagonal TsT models are ill-defined, we demonstrate that the composition with a Jordanian model regularises this issue. From the regularised Curve, we derive the one-loop shift of the classical energy and the semi-classical spectrum of excitations of a point-like string. In the TsT limit, the one-loop shift vanishes despite the loss of supersymmetry. Our results suggest that it may be possible to use standard Bethe Ansatze on spin chain pictures of deformed $N=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory dual to non-diagonal TsT models.</description>

      <title>De Sitter geometric inflation from dynamical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of geometric inflation, where the Friedmann equation is modified to incorporate an infinite series of higher curvature corrections, we describe the emergence of a de Sitter inflationary phase near the poles of an arbitrary dynamical function. Our analysis is quite general and does not depend on any specific choice of cosmological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Schottky-Kronecker forms and hyperelliptic polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic polylogarithms can be defined as iterated integrals on a genus-one Riemann surface of a set of integration kernels whose generating series was already considered by Kronecker in the 19th century. In this article, we employ the Schottky parametrization of a Riemann surface to construct higher-genus analogues of Kronecker's generating series, which we refer to as Schottky-Kronecker forms. Our explicit construction generalizes ideas from Bernard's higher-genus construction of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection. Integration kernels generated from the Schottky-Kronecker forms are defined as Poincar\'e series. Under technical assumptions, related to the convergence of these Poincar\'e series on the underlying Riemann surface, we argue that these integration kernels coincide with a set of differentials defined by Enriquez, whose iterated integrals constitute higher-genus analogues of polylogarithms. Enriquez' original definition is not well-suited for numerical evaluation of higher-genus polylogarithms. In contrast, the Poincar\'e series defining our integration kernels can be evaluated numerically for real hyperelliptic curves, for which the above-mentioned convergence assumptions can be verified. We numerically evaluate several examples of genus-two polylogarithms, thereby paving the way for numerical evaluation of hyperelliptic analogues of polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>The quantumness of relic gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the relic gravitons are produced in entangled states of opposite (comoving) three-momenta, their distributions and their averaged multiplicities must determine the maximal frequency of the spectrum above which the created pairs are exponentially suppressed. The absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency derived in this manner coincides with the THz domain and does not rely on the details of the cosmological scenario. The THz limit also translates into a constraint of the order of $10^{-33}$ on the minimal chirp amplitudes that should be effectively reached by all classes of hypothetical detectors aiming at the direct scrutiny of a signal in the frequency domain that encompasses the MHz and the GHz bands. The obtained high-frequency limit is deeply rooted in the quantumness of the produced gravitons whose multiparticle final sates are macroscopic but always non-classical. Since the unitary evolution preserves their coherence, the quantumness of the gravitons can be associated with an entanglement entropy that is associated with the loss of the complete information on the underlying quantum field. It turns out that the reduction of the density matrix in different bases leads to the same Von Neumann entropy whose integral over all the modes of the spectrum is dominated by the maximal frequency. Thanks to the THz bound the total integrated entropy of the gravitons can be comparable with the cosmic microwave background entropy but not larger. Besides the well known cosmological implications, we then suggest that a potential detection of gravitons between the MHz and the THz may therefore represent a direct evidence of macroscopic quantum states associated with the gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Emergence of inflaton potential from asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Asymptotic Safety Hypothesis for gravity relies on the existence of an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow, which controls the microscopic dynamics, and provides a UV completion of the theory. Connecting such UV completion to observable physics has become an active area of research in the last decades. In this work we show such connection within the framework of scalar-tensor models. More specifically, we found that cosmological inflation naturally emerges from the integration of the RG flow equations, and that the predicted parameters of the emergent effective potentials provide a slow-roll model of inflation compatible with current observations. Furthermore, the RG evolution of the effective action starting at the UV fixed point, provides a prediction for the initial value of the inflaton field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Brower-Goddard extension of the Veneziano and Virasoro-Shapiro four-point amplitudes obtained by generalizing the Koba-Nielsen integrals to $d$-dimensional conformally invariant integrals. The amplitudes derived from this framework exhibit polynomial residues and can be shown to adhere to polynomial bounds at high energies. In odd dimensions, the amplitudes decompose into sums of three partial amplitudes, enabling the formulation of general amplitude relations that subsume the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) formula as a particular case. The amplitudes contain multiple tachyons in their spectra. Still, we demonstrate that their residues comply with the positivity conditions mandated by unitarity for spacetime dimensions at or below critical values $D_\text{crit}(d)$, where $D_\text{crit}(6)=26$ and $D_\text{crit}(\infty)=10$. In closing, we contemplate physical applications for membranes and potential extensions of the formalism.</description>

      <title>Impurities with a cusp: general theory and 3d Ising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In CFTs, the partition function of a line defect with a cusp depends logarithmically on the size of the line with an angle-dependent coefficient: the cusp anomalous dimension. In the first part of this work, we study the general properties of the cusp anomalous dimension. We relate the small cusp angle limit to the effective field theory of defect fusion, making predictions for the first couple of terms in the expansion. Using a concavity property of the cusp anomalous dimension we argue that the Casimir energy between a line defect and its orientation reversal is always negative ("opposites attract"). We use these results to determine the fusion algebra of Wilson lines in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM as well as pinning field defects in the Wilson-Fisher fixed points. In the second part of the paper we obtain nonperturbative numerical results for the cusp anomalous dimension of pinning field defects in the Ising model in $d=3$, using the recently developed fuzzy-sphere regularization. We also compute the pinning field cusp anomalous dimension in the $O(N)$ model at one-loop in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. Our results are in agreement with the general theory developed in the first part of the work, and we make several predictions for impurities in magnets.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation from Lorentzian inversion in 1d CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the Lorentzian inversion formula, we derive a dispersion relation which computes a four-point function in 1d CFTs as an integral over its double discontinuity. The crossing symmetric kernel of the integral is given explicitly for the case of identical operators with integer or half-integer scaling dimension. This derivation complements the one that uses analytic functionals. We use the dispersion relation to evaluate holographic correlators defined on the half-BPS Wilson line of planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills, reproducing results up to fourth order in an expansion at large t'Hooft coupling.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek Mechanism and Beyond: Lessons from a Holographic Superfluid Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superfluid phase transition dynamics and associated spontaneous vortex formation with the crossing of the critical temperature in a disk geometry is studied in the framework of the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence by solving the Einstein-Abelian-Higgs model in an $AdS_4$ black hole. For a slow quench, the vortex density admits a universal scaling law with the cooling rate as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), while for fast quenches, the density shows a universal scaling behavior as a function of the final temperature, that lies beyond the KZM prediction. The vortex number distribution in both the power-law and saturation regimes can be approximated by a normal distribution. However, the study of the universal scaling of the cumulants reveals non-normal features and indicates that vortex statistics in the newborn superfluid is best described by the Poisson binomial distribution, previously predicted in the KZM regime [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 240602 (2020)]. This is confirmed by studying the cumulant scalings as a function of the quench time and the quench depth. Our work supports the existence of a universal defect number distribution that accommodates the KZM scaling, its breakdown at fast quenches, and the additional universal scaling laws as a function of the final value of the control parameter.</description>

      <title>The points of space are not points: their wavefunctions remove the ultraviolet divergences of quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The points $p(x)$ of space are observables that obey quantum mechanics with average values $\langle p(x) \rangle$ that obey general relativity. In empty flat 3-space, a point $p(x)$ may be represented as the sum $ \boldsymbol p(x) = \langle \boldsymbol p(x) \rangle+ \boldsymbol \epsilon(x)$ of its average value $\langle \boldsymbol p(x) \rangle = \boldsymbol x$ and its quantum remainder $ \boldsymbol \epsilon(x)$. The ubiquitous Fourier exponential $\exp( i \boldsymbol k \cdot \boldsymbol p(x))$ is then $\exp( i \boldsymbol k \cdot ( \boldsymbol x + \boldsymbol \epsilon))$. If the probability distribution of the quantum remainders $ \boldsymbol \epsilon(x)$ is normal and of width $\sigma$, then the average of the exponential $\langle \exp(i \boldsymbol k ( \boldsymbol x + \boldsymbol \epsilon ) \rangle$ contains a gaussian factor $ \exp( - \sigma^2 \boldsymbol k^2/2 ) $ which makes self-energies, Feynman diagrams and dark energy ultraviolet finite. This complex of ideas requires new bosons and suggests that supersymmetry is softly broken.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Explorer: Photon Ring Science, Detection and Shape Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity predicts that black hole images ought to display a bright, thin (and as-of-yet-unresolved) ring. This "photon ring" is produced by photons that explore the strong gravity of the black hole, flowing along trajectories that experience extreme light bending within a few Schwarzschild radii of the horizon before escaping. The shape of the photon ring is largely insensitive to the precise details of the emission from the astronomical source surrounding the black hole and therefore provides a direct probe of the Kerr geometry and its parameters. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is a proposed space-based experiment targeting the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* with radio-interferometric observations at frequencies of 100 GHz through 300 GHz and from an orbital distance of ~30,000 km. This design will enable measurements of the photon rings around both M87* and Sgr A*, confirming the Kerr nature of these sources and delivering sharp estimates of their masses and spins.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Effects on the Tachyon Inflation from Thermodynamic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering the Friedmann equations emerging from the entropy-area law of black hole thermodynamics in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle, we study tachyon inflation in the early universe. The presence of a minimal length modifies the Friedmann equations and hence the slow-roll and perturbation parameters in the tachyon model. These modifications, though small, affect the viability of the tachyon inflation in confrontation with observational data. We compare the numerical results of the model with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BAO+BK14(18) data and Planck2018 TT, TE,EE +lowE+lensing+BK14(18) +BAO+LIGO $\&amp;$ Virgo2016 data at $68\%$ and $95\%$ CL. We show that while the tachyon inflation with power-law, inverse power-law and inverse exponential potentials is not observationally viable in comparison with the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ confidence levels of the new joint data, in the presence of the minimal length the model becomes observationally viable.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum error correcting codes from conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy subspace of a conformal field theory (CFT) can serve as a quantum error correcting code, with important consequences in holography and quantum gravity. We consider generic 1+1D CFT codes under extensive local dephasing channels and analyze their error correctability in the thermodynamic limit. We show that (i) there is a finite decoding threshold if and only if the minimal nonzero scaling dimension in the fusion algebra generated by the jump operator of the channel is larger than $1/2$ and (ii) the number of protected logical qubits $k \geq \Omega( \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. As an application, we show that the one-dimensional quantum critical Ising model has a finite threshold for certain types of dephasing noise. Our general results also imply that a CFT code with continuous symmetry saturates a bound on the recovery fidelity for covariant codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems can host emergent `vacua' with particles, fields and dimension different from that of the universe we inhabit. Motivated by the appearance of emergent gauge fields with both electric and magnetic charges, we consider the fate of electromagnetism in two dimensions in such a setting. We find that generically electromagnetic fields are damped due to resistive effects. However, we can still identify a magnetohydrodynamic regime. It exhibits magnetosonic waves which, unlike in $d=3$, are isotropic, to which there is a contribution from the odd viscosity coefficient present in the system. Further, we find a dynamo action, which unlike in $d=3$ requires compressibility of the flow.</description>

      <title>Implications of a Scalar Field Interacting with the Dark Matter Fluid on the Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the implications of a scalar field interacting with the dark matter fluid on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. We choose an interaction type which before a critical matter density $\rho_m^c$ during the reheating era or early radiation domination era, the scalar field loses energy transferring it to the dark matter fluid, while after the critical matter density $\rho_m^c$ the dark matter fluid loses energy transferring it to the scalar field. The scalar field is assumed to have an exponential potential and at the critical matter density with $\rho_m\sim \rho_m^c$, at which point, the interaction between the scalar and the dark matter fluid is switched off, we demand that the effective equation of state of scalar field is described by a matter dominated era. This is crucial since it affects the behavior of the trajectories and the fixed points of the two dimensional dynamical system composed by the dark matter fluid and the scalar field. Specifically the phase space contains two stable dark matter dominated final attractors and two unstable stiff era dominated fixed points. Thus, there exists the remarkable possibility that the Universe might feel the passing of the scalar field through the unstable kinetic dominated fixed points, during the reheating era, with the total equation of state parameter of the Universe being deformed to be larger than $w=1/3$. This deformation of the total equation of state parameter during the reheating era can potentially have significant effects on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. Also the model we use also contains an $F(R)$ gravity which controls in a dominant way inflation and the late-time acceleration, in a phenomenologically viable way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upon introducing an heavy quark in the perturbative regime of the QCD conformal window we precisely determine the associated heavy meson spectrum and wave functions in terms of the number of light flavours and mass. We then compute the conformal Isgur-Wise function which is a central quantity in heavy quark physics. We further determine the impact of the residual low energy confining dynamics on the heavy meson spectrum. As a working framework, we adapt the heavy quark effective theory to the perturbative conformal window dynamics. Our work lays the foundations to systematically go beyond the infinite mass defect approximation in conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>An infinite-rank Lie algebra associated to SL$(2,\mathbb R)$ and SL$(2,\mathbb R)/U(1)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a generalised notion of Kac-Moody algebras using smooth maps from the non-compact manifolds ${\cal M}=$SL$(2,\mathbb R)$ and ${\cal M}=$ SL$(2,\mathbb R)/U(1)$ to a finite-dimensional simple Lie group $G$. This construction is achieved through two equivalent ways: by means of the Plancherel Theorem and by identifying a Hilbert basis within $L^2(\mathcal{M})$. We analyse the existence of central extensions and identify those in duality with Hermitean operators on $\cal M$. By inspecting the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$, we derive the Lie brackets characterising the corresponding generalised Kac-Moody algebras. The root structure of these algebras is identified, and it is shown that an infinite number of simultaneously commuting operators can be defined. Furthermore, we briefly touch upon applications of these algebras within the realm of supergravity, particularly in scenarios where the scalar fields coordinatize the non-compact manifold $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})/U(1)$.</description>

      <title>Managing Singular Kernels and Logarithmic Corrections in the Staggered Six-Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral properties of the staggered six-vertex model with ${\cal Z}_2$ symmetry for arbitrary system sizes $L$ using non-linear integral equations (NLIEs). Our study is motivated by two key questions: what is the accuracy of results based on the ODE/IQFT correspondence in the asymptotic regime of large system sizes, and what is the optimal approach based on NLIE for analyzing the staggered six-vertex model?
  We demonstrate that the quantization conditions for low-lying primary and descendant states, derived from the ODE/IQFT approach in the scaling limit, are impressively accurate even for relatively small system sizes. Specifically, in the anisotropy parameter range $\pi/4 &lt; \gamma &lt; \pi/2$, the difference between NLIE and ODE/IQFT results for energy and quasi-momentum eigenvalues is of order $\mathcal{O}(L^{-2})$.
  Furthermore, we present a unifying framework for NLIEs, distinguishing between versions with singular and regular kernels. We provide a compact derivation of NLIE with a singular kernel, followed by an equivalent set with a regular kernel. We address the stability issues in numerical treatments and offer solutions to achieve high-accuracy results, validating our approach for system sizes ranging from $L=2$ to $L=10^{24}$.
  Our findings not only validate the ODE/IQFT approach for finite system sizes but also enhance the understanding of NLIEs in the context of the staggered six-vertex model. We hope the insights gained from this study have significant implications for resolving the spectral problem of other lattice systems with emergent non-compact degrees of freedom and provide a foundation for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Fitting the DESI BAO Data with Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen--Kaplan--Nelson Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity constrains the range of validity of quantum field theory. As has been pointed out by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN), such effects lead to interdependent ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs that may stabilize the dark energy of the universe against quantum corrections, if the IR cutoff is set by the Hubble horizon. As a consequence of the cosmic expansion, this argument implies a time-dependent dark energy density. In this paper we confront this idea with recent data from DESI BAO, Hubble and supernova measurements. We find that the CKN model provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model and can compete with other models of time-dependent dark energy that have been studied so far.</description>

Abstract: We study the renormalizable group equations (RGEs) of the extended strong and weak gauge couplings in an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory, where three-generational SM fermions are non-trivially embedded. This framework was previously found to generate the observed SM quark/lepton mass hierarchies and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing pattern through its maximally breaking pattern. The field theoretical two-loop RGEs can not achieve the gauge coupling unification with the minimal setup, unless additional adjoint Higgs fields as well as the gravity-induced $d=5$ term to the ${\rm SU}(8)$ field strength term are included.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics at the BH horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find that the spin tends to increase the damping time of the fundamental mode for reflective ultracompact objects. We also find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes, and that the spin enhances the deviations from the black hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. We thus show that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the coefficients in the effective chiral Lagrangian from QCD, which includes pseudo-scalar mesons and vector mesons (with hidden symmetry), up to O(p4). This encompasses both the normal and anomalous parts. Our work builds on a previous study that derived the chiral Lagrangian from first principles of QCD, where the low-energy coefficients are defined in terms of specific Green's functions in QCD. This research extends our earlier efforts that focused on calculating the low-energy coefficients of the chiral Lagrangian for pure pseudo-scalar mesons. This marks the first calculation of chiral Lagrangian coefficients for vector mesons from QCD, particularly for the important parameters a and g, which are typically considered inputs in existing literature. Notably, the regularization method used previously is inadequate for this broader scope. We find that cut-off regularization yields reasonable results for both pseudo-scalar mesons and vector mesons, though it has certain limitations. Finally, we demonstrate that our method aligns with the Weinberg sum rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study black string solutions considering the Lifshitz anisotropic scaling. We have shown that a new class of asymptotically Lifshitz solutions can be generated by an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory with a cosmological constant. In the limit where we recover conformal scale invariance, we retrieve the usual black string solution. Furthermore, we demonstrated that to incorporate the effects of electric charge in the black string, at least two independent gauge fields coupled to the dilaton field are necessary. The charged black string solution exhibits new horizons that depend on the potential in Lifshitz exponent $z$. The stability of these new solutions is investigated through the thermodynamic analysis of the charged black string. The temperature, entropy, and heat capacity indicate that these modified black strings are thermodynamically stable.</description>

Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in various models of quantum field theory: free massive bosons and fermions on flat space and on spheres, holographic models, and lattice models with the UV-cutoff. In certain cases we find asymptotic behavior of Lanczos coefficients, which goes beyond previously observed universality. We confirm that in all cases the exponential growth of Krylov complexity satisfies the conjectural inequality, which generalizes the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound on chaos. We discuss temperature dependence of Lanczos coefficients and note that the relation between the growth of Lanczos coefficients and chaos may only hold for the sufficiently late, truly asymptotic regime governed by the physics at the UV cutoff. Contrary to previous suggestions, we show scenarios when Krylov complexity in quantum field theory behaves qualitatively differently from the holographic complexity.</description>

      <title>Signum-Gordon shock waves in (2+1) and (3+1) dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces novel, exact solutions to the scalar field Signum-Gordon equation that feature a discontinuity near the light cone. These solutions, applicable in higher spatial dimensions ($n &gt; 1$), extend previous limitations to one dimension. Our chosen ansatz leads to an ordinary equation with exact solutions obtained for $n = 2$ and $3$ spatial dimensions. The shock wave's energy trapped within the light cone is proportional to the wave's $n$-dimensional volume and the field discontinuity at the wavefront. The investigation delves further into the behavior of shock waves when their driving force, represented by a delta function at the light cone, is disabled. Disabling this delta function disrupts energy transfer, preventing the wave's propagation as predicted by analytical calculations. We identify the region within the light cones where the field remains unaffected. Two-dimensional ($n = 2$) simulations reveal the formation of intriguing structures upon source removal. These structures include a central, stable feature resembling an oscillon and a surrounding ring that breaks down into smaller oscillations.</description>

      <title>Local quenches in fracton field theory: Lieb-Robinson bound, non-causal dynamics and fractal excitation patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics induced by a local perturbation in fracton field theory. For the ${\mathbb Z}_4$ and ${\mathbb Z}_8$-symmetric free fractonic theories, we compute the time dynamics of several observables such as the two-point Green function, $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ condensate, energy density, and the dipole momentum. The time-dependent considerations highlight that the free fractonic theory breaks causality and exhibits instantaneous signal propagation, even if an additional relativistic term is included to enforce a speed limit in the system. We show that it is related to the fact that the Lieb-Robinson bound does not hold in the continuum limit of the fracton field theory, and the effective bounded speed of light does not emerge. For the theory in finite volume, we show that the fracton wave front acquires fractal shape with non-trivial Hausdorff dimension, and argue that this phenomenon cannot be explained by a simple self-interference effect.</description>

      <title>Reduced tensor network formulation for non-Abelian gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formulating non-Abelian gauge theories as a tensor network is known to be challenging due to the internal degrees of freedom that result in the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum. In two dimensions, it is straightforward to 'trace out' these degrees of freedom with the use of character expansion, giving a reduced tensor network where the degeneracy associated with the internal symmetry is eliminated. In this work, we show that such an index loop also exists in higher dimensions in the form of a closed tensor network we call the 'armillary sphere'. This allows us to completely eliminate the matrix indices and reduce the overall size of the tensors in the same way as is possible in two dimensions. This formulation allows us to include significantly more representations with the same tensor size, thus making it possible to reach a greater level of numerical accuracy in the tensor renormalization group computations.</description>

Abstract: Using carefully chosen projections, we consider different Carroll limits of relativistic Dirac fermions in any spacetime dimensions. These limits define Carroll fermions of two types: electric and magnetic. The latter type transforms as a reducible but indecomposable representation of the Carroll group. We also build action principles for all Carroll fermions we introduce; in particular, in even dimensions we provide an action principle for a minimal magnetic Carroll fermion, having the same number of components as a Dirac spinor. We then explore the coupling of these fermions to magnetic Carroll gravity in both its first-order and second-order formulations.</description>

Abstract: We study the relation between the quantum integrable systems derived from the dimer graphs and five dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^4$. We construct integrable systems based on new dimer graphs obtained from modification of hexagon dimer diagram. We study the gauge theories in correspondence to the newly proposed integrable systems. By examining three types of defects -- a line defect, a canonical co-dimensional two defect and a monodromy defect -- in five-dimensional gauge theory with $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and $\Omega_{\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2}$-background. We identify, in the $\varepsilon_2 \to 0$ limit, the canonical co-dimensional two defect satisfying the Baxter T-Q equation of the generalized $A$-type dimer integrable system, and the monodromy defect as its common eigenstate of the commuting Hamiltonians, with the eigenvalues being the expectation value of the BPS Wilson loop in the anti-symmetric representation of the bulk gauge group.</description>

      <title>The Lyapunov exponent as a signature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distinct feature of Hermitian quantum chaotic dynamics is the exponential increase of certain out-of-time-order-correlation (OTOC) functions around the Ehrenfest time with a rate given by a Lyapunov exponent. Physically, the OTOCs describe the growth of quantum uncertainty that crucially depends on the nature of the quantum motion. Here, we employ the OTOC in order to provide a precise definition of dissipative quantum chaos. For this purpose, we compute analytically the Lyapunov exponent for the vectorized formulation of the large $q$-limit of a $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model coupled to a Markovian bath. These analytic results are confirmed by an explicit numerical calculation of the Lyapunov exponent for several values of $q \geq 4$ based on the solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations. We show that the Lyapunov exponent decreases monotonically as the coupling to the bath increases and eventually becomes negative at a critical value of the coupling signaling a transition to a dynamics which is no longer quantum chaotic. Therefore, a positive Lyapunov exponent is a defining feature of dissipative many-body quantum chaos. The observation of the breaking of the exponential growth for sufficiently strong coupling suggests that dissipative quantum chaos may require in certain cases a sufficiently weak coupling to the environment.</description>

      <title>Flowing Between String Vacua for the Critical Non-Abelian Vortex with Deformation of N=2 Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that non-Abelian solitonic vortex string supported in four-dimensional (4D) N=2 supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with the U(2) gauge group and $N_f=4$ quark flavors becomes a critical superstring. This string propagates in the ten-dimensional space formed by a product of the flat 4D space and an internal space given by a Calabi-Yau noncompact threefold, namely, the conifold. The spectrum of low lying closed string states was found and interpreted as a spectrum of hadrons in 4D N=2 SQCD. In particular, the lowest string state appears to be a massless BPS baryon associated with the deformation of the complex structure modulus $b$ of the conifold. It was recently shown that the Coulomb branch of the associated string sigma model which opens up at strong coupling can be described by N=2 Liouville theory. Building on these results we switch on quark masses in 4D N=2 SQCD and study the interpolation of the initial U(2) SQCD with $N_f=4$ quarks to the final SQCD with the U(4) gauge group and $N_f=8$ quarks. To find the true string vacuum which arises due to the mass deformation we solve the effective supergravity equations of motion associated with the deformed world sheet Liouville theory. We show that the massless BPS baryon $b$ survives the deformation and that finding of the spectrum of low lying massive hadrons in the final SQCD is linked to the Calogero problem.</description>

      <title>Finite cut-off JT and Liouville quantum gravities on the disk at one loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the path integral formalism, we compute the disk partition functions of two dimensional Liouville and JT quantum gravity theories coupled to a matter CFT of central charge $c$, with cosmological constant $\Lambda$, in the limit $c\rightarrow -\infty$, $|\Lambda|\rightarrow\infty$, for fixed $\Lambda/c$ and fixed and finite disk boundary length $\ell$, to leading and first subleading order in the $1/|c|$ expansion. In the case of Liouville theory, we find perfect agreement with the asymptotic expansion of the known exact FZZT partition function. In the case of JT gravity, we obtain the first explicit results for the partition functions at finite cut-off, in the three versions (negative, zero and positive curvature) of the model. Our findings are in agreement with predictions from the recent proposal for a microscopic definition of JT gravity, including the $c\rightarrow -\infty$ expansion of the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary. In the negative curvature case, we also provide evidence for the emergence of an effective Schwarzian description at length scales much greater than the curvature length scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study holographic supersymmetric Renyi entropies from a family of hyperbolic black holes in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) system under the BPS condition. We calculate the thermodynamic quantities of these hyperbolic black holes. We find a remarkably simple formula of the supersymmetric Renyi entropy that unifies (interpolates) 11 cases embeddable to 10 or 11 dimensional supergravity. It reproduces many known results in the literature, and gives new results with distinctive features. We show that the supersymmetric version of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement cannot be mapped to thermal quantities, due to the dependence of the temperature and the chemical potential by the BPS condition. We also calculate the entanglement spectrum. We derive the potential of the EMD system from a $V=0$ solution and obtain two neutral solutions with scalar hair as a byproduct.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the Casimir effect of a wedge and its holographic dual. We prove that the displacement operator universally determines the wedge Casimir effect in the smooth limit. Besides, we argue that the wedge Casimir energy increases with the opening angle and test it with several examples. Furthermore, we construct the holographic dual of wedges in AdS/BCFT in general dimensions. We verify that our proposal can produce the expected Casimir effect within smooth and singular limits. We observe that the Casimir energy density of a wedge increases with the brane tension. Next, we discuss the wedge contribution to holographic entanglement entropy and find it increases with the opening angle, similar to the wedge Casimir energy. Finally, we briefly discuss the holographic polygon in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ and its generalization to higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that a complex coordinate transformation maps the Taub-NUT instanton metric to a Kerr-Schild metric. This metric involves a semi-infinite line defect as a gravitational analog of the Dirac string, much like the original metric. Also, it corresponds to self-dual dyon in electromagnetism through three versions of classical double copy, one of them being a novel nonlocal operator form. The relevance to Newman-Janis algorithm is briefly noted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look at the fusing matrices that arise when a topological defect is attached to a conformal boundary condition. We call such junctions open topological defects. One type of fusing matrices arises when two open defects fuse while another arises when an open defect passes through a boundary operator. We use the topological field theory approach to RCFTs based on Frobenius algebra objects in modular tensor categories to describe the general structure associated with such matrices and how to compute them from a given Frobenius algebra object and its representation theory. We illustrate the computational process on the rational free boson theories. Applications to boundary renormalisation group flows are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Higher Gauge Theory and Integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of integrable systems from a gauge theoretic perspective. This development originated with the introduction of $4$d Chern-Simons theory with defects, which provided a systematic framework for constructing two-dimensional integrable systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach to studying higher-dimensional integrable models employing techniques from higher category theory. Starting with higher Chern-Simons theory on the $4$-manifold $\mathbb{R}\times Y$, we complexify and compactify the real line to $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and introduce the disorder defect $\omega=z^{-1}\mathrm{d} z $. This procedure defines a holomorphic five-dimensional variant of higher Chern-Simons theory, which, when endowed with suitable boundary conditions, allows for the localisation to a three-dimensional theory on $Y$. The equations of motion of the resulting model are equivalent to the flatness of a $2$-connection $(L,H)$, that we then use to construct the corresponding higher holonomies. We prove that these are invariants of homotopies relative boundary, which enables the construction of conserved quantities. The latter are labelled by both the categorical characters of a Lie crossed-module and the infinite number of homotopy classes of surfaces relative boundary in $Y$. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the $3$d theory has left and right acting symmetries whose current algebra is given by an infinite dimensional centrally extended affine Lie 2-algebra. Both of these conditions are direct higher homotopy analogues of the properties satisfied by the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten CFT, which we therefore interpret as facets of integrable structures.</description>

Abstract: We apply reinforcement learning (RL) to generate fine regular star triangulations of reflexive polytopes, that give rise to smooth Calabi-Yau (CY) hypersurfaces. We demonstrate that, by simple modifications to the data encoding and reward function, one can search for CYs that satisfy a set of desirable string compactification conditions. For instance, we show that our RL algorithm can generate triangulations together with holomorphic vector bundles that satisfy anomaly cancellation and poly-stability conditions in heterotic compactification. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm can be used to search for reflexive subpolytopes together with compatible triangulations that define fibration structures of the CYs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field theoretical tools are developed so that one can analyze quantum phenomena such as transition radiation that must have occurred during the Higgs condensate bubble expansion through plasma in the early universe. Integral representations of Bosonic and Fermionic propagators are presented for the case that particle masses are varied continuously during the passage through the bubble wall interface between symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken regions. The construction of propagators is based on the so-called eigenfunction expansion method associated with self-adjoint differential operators, developed by Weyl, Stone, Titchmarsh, Kodaira and several others. A novel method of field quantization in the presence of the bubble wall is proposed by using the spectral functions introduced in constructing the two-point Green's functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the continuous symmetry transformations for the three ($2 + 1$)-dimensional (3D) system of a combination of the free Abelian 1-form and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. We establish that this combined system is a tractable field-theoretic model of Hodge theory. The symmetry operators of our present theory provide the physical realizations of the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry at the algebraic level. Our present investigation is important in the sense that, for the first time, we are able to establish an odd dimensional (i.e. $D = 3$) field-theoretic system to be an example for Hodge theory (besides earlier works on a few interesting ($0 + 1$)-dimensional toy models as well as a set of well-known ${\mathcal N} = 2$ SUSY quantum mechanical systems of physical interest). For the sake of brevity, we have not taken into account the 3D Chern-Simon term for the Abelian 1-form gauge field in our theory which allows the mass and gauge-invariance to co-exist together.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to memory of late Professor V. G. Bagrov, who was my first teacher in theoretical physics. About 45 years later, theoretical physics has changed and me too. The subject of this paper relates some old ideas in cosmology with some recent ideas, as is reflected in the title. The current status of Starobinsky inflation is reviewed and compared to three main conjectures in the Swampland program. It is argued that the Starobinsky inflation model is not in conflict with those Swampland conjectures in their basic versions.</description>

      <title>Memory Effect of Gravitational Wave Pulses in PP-Wave Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06208v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the gravitational memory effect in pp-wave spacetimes due to the passage of a pulse having the form of a ramp profile through this spacetime. We have analyzed the effect of this pulse on the evolution of nearby geodesics, and have determined analytical solutions of the geodesic equations in the Brinkmann coordinates. We have also examined the changes in the separation between a pair of geodesics and their velocity profiles. The separation (along $ x $ or $ y $-direction) increases monotonically from an initial constant value. In contrast, the relative velocity grows from zero and settles to a final non-zero constant value. These resulting changes are retained as memory after the pulse dies out. The nature of this memory is similar to that determined by earlier workers using Gaussian, square, and other pulse profiles, thereby validating the universality of gravitational wave memory.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic and intrinsic effects setting viscosity in complex fluids and life processes: the role of fundamental physical constants</title>

Abstract: Understanding the values and origin of fundamental physical constants, one of the grandest challenges in modern science, has been discussed in particle physics, astronomy and cosmology. More recently, it was realised that fundamental constants have a bio-friendly window set by life processes involving motion and flow. This window is related to intrinsic fluid properties such as energy and length scales in condensed matter set by fundamental constants. Here, we discuss important extrinsic factors governing the viscosity of complex fluids operating in life processes due to collective effects. We show that both extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting viscosity need to be taken into account when estimating the bio-friendly range of fundamental constants from life processes, and our discussion provides a straightforward recipe for doing this. We also find that the relative role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors depends on the range of variability of these intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Remarkably, the viscosity of a complex fluid such as blood with significant extrinsic effects is not far from the intrinsic viscosity calculated using the fundamental constants only, and we discuss the reason for this in terms of dynamics of contact points between cells.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for solving functional renormalization group on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing high-dimensional partial differential equations to derive effective actions within the functional renormalization group is formidable, especially when considering various field configurations, including inhomogeneous states, even on lattices. We leverage physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a state-of-the-art machine learning method for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations to overcome this challenge. In a zero-dimensional O($N$) model, we numerically demonstrate the construction of an effective action on an $N$-dimensional configuration space, extending up to $N=100$. Our results underscore the effectiveness of PINN approximation, even in scenarios lacking small parameters such as a small coupling.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Computing of Shear Viscosity for $2+1D$ SU(2) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a nonperturbative calculation of the shear viscosity for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory by using the lattice Hamiltonian formulation. The retarded Green's function of the stress-energy tensor is calculated from real time evolution via exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian with a local Hilbert space truncation, and the shear viscosity is obtained via the Kubo formula. When taking the continuum limit, we account for the renormalization group flow of the coupling but no additional operator renormalization. We find the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density $\frac{\eta}{s}$ is consistent with a well-known holographic result $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ at several temperatures on a $4\times4$ honeycomb lattice with the local electric representation truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. We also find the ratio of the spectral function and frequency $\frac{\rho^{xy}(\omega)}{\omega}$ exhibits a peak structure when the frequency is small.
  Both the exact diagonalization method and simple matrix product state classical simulation method beyond $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$ on bigger lattices require exponentially growing resources. So we develop a quantum computing method to calculate the retarded Green's function and analyze various systematics of the calculation including $j_{\rm max}$ truncation and finite size effects, Trotter errors and the thermal state preparation efficiency. Our thermal state preparation method still requires resources that grow exponentially with the lattice size, but with a very small prefactor at high temperature. We test our quantum circuit on both the Quantinuum emulator and the IBM simulator for a small lattice and obtain results consistent with the classical computing ones.</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type featuring non-minimal couplings are shown to emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a QCD-like theory with an either sub-Planckian or trans-Planckian confining scale and that is renormalizable on Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

      <title>Exact vacuum spacetimes from Fierz-Pauli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime are considered . Those are of the form $\bg_{\m\n}+ l_\m l_\n$ with $l^2=0$. The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms. one is essentially the Fierz-Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr-Schild family is recovered. Novel examples for more general backgrounds are discussed.</description>
