      <title>Spectral line-shape in collinear laser spectroscopy after atomic charge exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collinear laser spectroscopy experiments on fast, neutral beams have been extensively used for studies on short-lived radioactive nuclei, taking advantage of its high sensitivity. The resulting resonance line-shape is known to show significant distortion, due to the energy exchange during the charge-exchange neutralization process, which can cause large systematic uncertainty in the determined centroid. A model for the line shape was constructed and simulated to be compared to measured Al, Si, and Ni hyperfine spectra. It is shown that the distortion is caused mainly by the transfer of electron into many different energy levels in the projectile atom and subsequent decays, rather than secondary inelastic collisions, which were often assumed in the line shape analysis before. The model can also be applied to other projectile-alkali pairs, providing a reliable line-shape with less fitting parameters than conventional phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Interfacing Rydberg atoms with a chip-based superconducting microwave resonator using an ac Stark shifted single-photon transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium atoms in the 1s50s $^3$S$_1$ Rydberg level have been resonantly coupled to the $2\pi\times11.721$ GHz second harmonic mode of a chip-based superconducting coplanar waveguide microwave resonator. To achieve this, the single-photon electric-dipole-allowed 1s50s $^3$S$_1\rightarrow$ 1s50p $^3$P$_J$ transition was tuned into resonance with the resonator mode through the ac Stark shift induced by a second strong $2\pi\times3.350$ GHz microwave dressing field. The effects of this dressing field, and residual uncanceled dc electric fields at the location of the atoms close to the superconducting chip surface were interpreted with support from Floquet calculations of the energy level structure of the Rydberg states. To observe appreciable population transfer in the $1~\mu$s atom-resonator interaction time using this transition, which had an electric dipole moment of $1500 e a_0$, pulsed microwave fields were injected into the resonator. From the photon occupation number in the resonator mode under these conditions, the single-photon Rabi frequency associated with the coupling of the atoms to the resonator was estimated to be $\sim2\pi\times100$ Hz. These results represent an important step toward operation of this Rydberg-atom-superconducting-circuit interface in the single-photon strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Ultranarrow Superradiant Laser via Dressed Dark State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiant laser, which exploits the clock transition of alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms to generate ultrastable light in the bad-cavity limit, has garnered much attention in the past few decades. Unlike their odd counterpart, the even isotopes of alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms possess simpler structures and longer-lived transitions, which would relax the field control requirements and enhance the frequency stability of the output light. However, due to the absence of hyper-fine interaction in even isotopes, the transition from the state $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{0}$ to $^{1}$S$_{0}$ is strictly forbidden, leading to a vanishing coupling strength between the cavity mode and the atoms (the state $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{0}$ as a dark state). In this work, we suggest a superradiant laser scheme by dressing this dark state with a small bright component by virtue of a static magnetic field. In contrast to other proposals utilizing natural atomic transitions, our dressed-state protocol can work from the crossover regime (coherence in both atoms and photons) to the superradiant lasing regime (coherence solely in atoms). Specially, by operating deep into the superradiant lasing regime, our scheme witnesses a dramatic line-narrowing feature (mHz level) while maintaining its power. Furthermore, compared to the crossover regime, the laser frequency in the superradiant lasing regime is more robust against the fluctuations of the cavity length and magnetic field strength. Our proposal demonstrates the potential for extracting ultranarrow light from even isotopes of the alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms and may find its role in frequency stabilization and related precision measurement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional trapping of circular Rydberg atoms by a superimposed vortex light beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to trap circular Rydberg atoms (CRAs) by a ponderomotive potential well formed with a superimposed vortex light beam. We calculate analytically the ponderomotive potential energy for a Bessel vortex light beam. We work out a corrected version of the classical circular orbit approximation for a CRA which fits the exact result much better than the usual approximation. We reveal the three-dimensional characteristics of the potential well for some benchmark values of the CRA principal quantum number and beam parameters such as the frequency, the opening angle and topological charge of the vortex. We investigate how we can achieve similar trapping effects for different principal quantum numbers by varying beam parameters. The potential provides a lattice structure in the beam axis where one CRA could be trapped at each lattice site.</description>

      <title>Role of sub-barrier dynamics in coherent and incoherent radiation during tunneling ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation during strong-field tunneling ionization is investigated. The spontaneous as well as the coherent component of the radiation are calculated and the role of the under-the-barrier dynamics is analyzed. The competition of the contribution of different mechanisms in different spectral regions is examined. Transition-like radiation (Brunel radiation) is dominated at low-frequencies, Thomson scattering -- at the laser frequencies, and radiative recombination via the three-step process -- at high-order harmonics. The under-the-barrier dynamics is shown to enhance the Brunel radiation for near-zero-frequencies in asymmetric laser pulses for spontaneous as well as for the coherent radiation.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Atomic Magnetometer-Based Imaging of Integrated Circuits and Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution magnetic imaging system based on a free-induction-decay (FID) optically pumped magnetometer (OPM), integrated with a two-axis scanning micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) micromirror for automated beam steering. A double-pass optical geometry enables the millimeter-scale device under test (DUT) to be placed directly behind the vapor cell, minimizing the standoff distance and thereby improving spatial resolution, which is fundamentally limited by atomic spin diffusion and the optical beam waist. The functionality of the imaging system was tested on a diverse set of magnetic sources, including a custom printed-circuit board (PCB) with alternating copper tracks, whose measured results agreed well with theoretical predictions based on the Biot-Savart law. The system successfully resolves spatially varying current distributions, identifies polarity-dependent asymmetries in an integrated bridge rectifier chip, and tracks the dynamic current evolution of a ceramic battery in situ. These capabilities highlight its potential for noninvasive diagnostics of electronic circuits and batteries.</description>

      <title>Probing disorder-driven topological phase transitions via topological edge modes with ultracold atoms in Floquet-engineered honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most fascinating properties of topological phases of matter is their robustness to disorder and imperfections. Although several experimental techniques have been developed to probe the geometric properties of engineered topological Bloch bands with cold atoms, they almost exclusively rely on the translational invariance of the underlying lattice. This prevents direct studies of topology in the presence of disorder, further hindering an extension to disordered interacting topological phases. Here, we identify disorder-driven phase transitions between two distinct Floquet topological phases using the characteristic properties of topological edge modes with ultracold atoms in periodically-driven two-dimensional (2D) optical lattices. Our results constitute an important step towards studying the rich interplay between topology and disorder with cold atoms. Moreover, our measurements confirm that disorder indeed favors the anomalous Floquet topological regime over conventional Hall systems, indicating an enhanced robustness and paving the way towards observing exotic out-of-equilibrium phases such as the anomalous Floquet Anderson insulator.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensate of ultracold sodium-rubidium molecules with tunable dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules is a long-standing challenge in ultracold physics and quantum science due to near-universal two-body collisional losses. Here, we report the production of a Bose-Einstein condensate of ground-state sodium-rubidium molecules via high efficiency evaporative cooling, with losses suppressed using the dual microwave shielding technique. The ability to tune the dipolar interaction between these ultracold polar molecules is crucial for producing the condensate and enables exciting prospects for future applications. We explore different regimes of dipolar interactions, realizing both the gas phase and the quantum droplet phase of the molecular condensate. This work opens new avenues for investigating quantum matter with strong dipolar interactions and for quantum simulation of long-range many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Electric-field metrology of a terahertz frequency comb using Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz radiation finds an increasing number of applications, yet efficient generation and detection remain a challenge and an active area of research. In particular, the precise detection of weak and narrowband terahertz signals is notoriously difficult. Here, we employ a novel type of single-photon detector based on Rydberg atoms to both detect and calibrate a terahertz frequency comb over an octave-spanning range, yet with a MHz-level selectivity. We calibrate the intensity of the electric field of the comb against the fundamental atomic properties, while achieving the intensity (power) sensitivity down to 35.9 $\mathrm{fW\ cm^{-2}\ Hz^{-0.5}}$ (1.46 $\mathrm{fW\ Hz^{-0.5}}$) within a single mode of the frequency comb, all in a room-temperature operated setup. Our results elucidate the transition of terahertz frequency combs into the quantum regime, enabling high-precision and high-sensitivity spectroscopy. This breakthrough allows terahertz science to better leverage revolutionary techniques developed for optical frequency combs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments with ultracold quantum gases are a rapidly advancing research field with many applications in fundamental physics and quantum technology. Here, we report on a high-flux generation of Bose-Einstein condensate mixtures of $^{41}$K and $^{87}$Rb, using a fully integrated sounding rocket setup. We investigate the release and the free expansion of the quantum mixtures for different orientations to gravity. The release dynamics are governed by the mixture interactions as well as the decaying magnetic field during the release. The latter can be minimized by a dedicated switch-off protocol of the trap generating currents where an exact model enabled us to characterize the interaction effects. Our results establish a new benchmark for generating ultracold mixtures on mobile platforms, with direct relevance for future experiments on interacting quantum gases and tests of the equivalence principle in space.</description>

      <title>Variational Calculation of the Hyperfine Stark Effect in Atomic $^{87}$Rb, $^{133}$Cs, and $^{169}$Tm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An electronically variational approach to the calculation of atomic hyperfine structure transition energies under the influence of static external electric fields is presented. The method avoids the calculation of intermediate atomic states entirely and requires only the wavefunctions of the electronic states involved in the respective hyperfine levels. These wavefunctions are obtained through relativistic general-excitation-rank configuration interaction theory. A variant of the method also enables for calculations on atoms with the most complicated of shell structures.
  Applications to $^{87}$Rb, $^{133}$Cs and a specific clock transition in $^{169}$Tm are presented. The final results $k_{\text{Rb}} = -1.234 \pm 0.0223$ [$10^{-10}$ Hz/((V/m)$^2$)] and $k_{\text{Cs}} = -2.347 \pm 0.084$ [$10^{-10}$ Hz/((V/m)$^2$)] obtained under inclusion of up to quintuple excitations in the atomic wavefunction expansion are compatible with previous calculations and, in the case of Cs, confirm that one of the earlier experimental measurements is not reliable. For $^{169}$Tm that is used in the development of atomic clocks the differential static scalar electric dipole polarizability between ground levels $J=\frac{7}{2}$ and $J=\frac{5}{2}$ is calculated to be $\Delta\alpha^s_0 = -0.134 \pm 0.11$ a.u. This result from a pure {\it{ab initio}} calculation confirms the result of $\Delta\alpha^s_0 = -0.063^{+0.01}_{-0.005}$ a.u. obtained in {\it{Nat. Comm.}} {\bf{10}} (2019) 1724 where a combination of measurement and theoretical modeling has been used.</description>

      <title>Realization of a doped quantum antiferromagnet with dipolar tunnelings in a Rydberg tweezer array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points of atomic vapors: The spectral signatures of quantum jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate spectral singularities in an alkali-metal atomic vapor modeled using four and effectively three hyperfine states. By comparing the eigenvalue spectra of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) and a Liouvillian superoperator, we analyze the emergence and characteristics of both semiclassical and quantum exceptional points. Our results reveal that, for atomic systems, the NHH approach alone may be insufficient to fully capture the system's spectral properties. While NHHs can yield accurate predictions in certain regimes, a comprehensive description typically requires the Liouvillian formalism, which governs the Lindblad master equation and explicitly incorporates quantum jump processes responsible for repopulation dynamics. We demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum jumps fundamentally alters the spectral structure of the system. In particular, we present examples in which the existence, location in parameter space, or even the order of spectral degeneracies differ significantly between the two approaches, thereby highlighting the impact of quantum jumps and the limitations of the NHH method. Finally, using the hybrid-Liouvillian formalism, we show how quantum jumps reshape spectral features initially predicted by the NHH, ultimately determining the full Liouvillian spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Harnessing quantum resources in the atomic external degrees of freedom, particularly matter-wave states with large momentum broadening, holds significant potential for enhancing the sensitivity of Kasevich-Chu atom gravimeters at the standard quantum limit. However, a fully quantum-mechanical investigation of the critical Doppler effect inherent to this approach remains lacking. Employing SU(2) Lie group theory, we derive a generic scalar Riccati equation governing the unitary dynamics of the Rabi model within a linear potential and analyze the Doppler effect's impact on Rabi oscillations because of the strong coupling between the internal and external states. Furthermore, by integrating Fisher information theory, we demonstrate the approximate universality and high metrological gain of phase-rotation measurement protocols under strong Doppler broadening induced by large-momentum width. This theoretical work provides insightful implications for broader generalization, such as extensions to finite-temperature scenarios or multi-pulse sequences, exemplified by the $\pi/2-\pi-\pi/2$ pulse sequence characteristic of Kasevich-Chu atom gravimeters. Thus this study lays a theoretical foundation for developing high-sensitivity, noise-resistant atom gravimeters that leverage external-state quantum resources.</description>
