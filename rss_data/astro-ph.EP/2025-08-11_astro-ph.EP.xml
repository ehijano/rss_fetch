      <title>Scaling K2 VIII: Short-Period Sub-Neptune Occurrence Rates Peak Around Early-Type M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uniformly combined data from the NASA Kepler and K2 missions to compute planet occurrence rates across the entire FGK and M dwarf stellar range. The K2 mission, driven by targets selected by guest observers, monitored nine times more M dwarfs than the Kepler mission. Combined, Kepler and K2 observed 130 short-period ($P=1-40$ days) Earth to Neptune-sized candidate planets orbiting M dwarfs. K2 observed 3.5 times more of these planets than Kepler for host stars below 3700 K. Our planet occurrence rates show that short-period sub-Neptunes peak at $3750^{+153}_{-97}$ K and drop for cooler M dwarfs. A peak near this location was predicted by pebble accretion planet formation models and confirmed here by observations for the first time. Super-Earths continue to increase in occurrence toward cooler stars and show no clear evidence of a peak in the host star range considered here (3200 K$-$6900 K). Our observations provide critical input to further refine planet formation models. We strongly recommend further study of mid-to-late M dwarfs with TESS and soon the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and PLATO to identify additional small planet trends.</description>

      <title>Evidence For Turbulent Concentration In Particle-Laden Midplane Layers of Planet-Forming Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we investigate the axisymmetric, weakly turbulent state of settled particle layers in a localized model of a protoplanetary disk. We focus on conditions in which the large-scale axisymmetric filaments typically associated with the streaming instability (SI) either cannot form or have not yet developed. Under these circumstances, we observe small-scale particle clumping consistent with turbulent concentration (TC), in which short particle filaments collect along regions of high gas strain rate and enclose gas-only voids exhibiting coherent vorticity. Despite varying particle Stokes numbers $\St_K$ which are defined relative to the Keplerian frequency, the {\it effective} Stokes numbers within voids, $\St_\omega$ -- defined instead relative to the local gas vorticity -- consistently center around 0.3. The latter coincides with the special value identified in prior statistical studies of TC as the scale where particle clustering is most intermittent. This convergence likely reflects how particle feedback structures and sustains voids -- an effect possibly distinctive to axisymmetric configurations. A timescale comparison reveals that in simulations with midplane particle-to-gas density ratios below unity and $\St_K \ll 1$, SI growth rates are 1 -- 2 orders of magnitude slower than the turbulent overturn frequencies at the driving scale. This disparity appears to effectively rule out SI as the primary driver of turbulence in these cases. Instead, we suggest the Symmetric Instability (SymI) may be responsible. We further observe that for St$_K\ll 1$, TC is a persistent feature of turbulent particle layers , and that Roche-exceeding small-scale fluctuations within large-scale SI filaments reported in the literature are in fact not SI, but expressions of TC amplified by the elevated particle densities within those large-scale structures.</description>

      <title>The tidal interaction of an orbiting giant planet with a star near the Kraft break: the excitation of $r$-modes and the retention of orbital and spin angular momenta misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the previous work of Papaloizou \&amp; Savonije on tidal interactions between a solar mass star and a closely orbiting giant planet which is such that the orbital and stellar spin angular momentum directions are misaligned. Here we consider the situation when the central star has a mass of $1.3 M_{\odot}$ and is in the vicinity of the Kraft break. We find and determine the properties of the lowest order $r$ modes and the tidal response arising from the secular non axisymmetric forcing associated with a misaligned orbit. We find that the response of the thin convective envelope, as well as the shift of $r$ mode frequencies from the low rotation frequency, limit can be understood by adopting a vertically averaged model that is similar to the well known one governed by the Laplace tidal equation for an incompressible ocean. From our results we are able to estimate lower bounds on realignment time scales for hot Jupiter systems with orbital periods in the range $2.8-5 d$ and rotation periods in the range $5-31 d$ that indicate the process is indeed markedly less effective than for a solar type star. This is on account of there being less dissipation in a relatively smaller convective envelope as well as the generally faster rotation and hence larger spin angular momentum expected for the more massive star.</description>

      <title>A D/H Ratio Consistent with Earth's Water in Halley-type Comet 12P from ALMA HDO Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopic measurements of Solar System bodies provide a primary paradigm within which to understand the origins and histories of planetary materials. The D/H ratio in particular, helps reveal the relationship between (and heritage of) different H$_2$O reservoirs within the Solar System. Here we present interferometric maps of water (H$_2$O) and semiheavy water (HDO) in the gas-phase coma of a comet (Halley-type comet 12P/Pons-Brooks), obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The maps are consistent with outgassing of both H$_2$O and HDO directly from the nucleus, and imply a coma D/H ratio (for water) of $(1.71 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-4}$. This is at the lower end of the range of previously-observed values in comets, and is consistent with D/H in Earth's ocean water. Our results suggest a possible common heritage between a component of the Oort cloud's water ice reservoir, and the water that was delivered to the young Earth during the early history of the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Origin of Ganymede and the Galilean Moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ganymede and the Galilean moons formed in a small gas disc around the gas-accreting proto-Jupiter, known as the circum-Jovian disc (CJD). The formation process of the satellites occurs in three steps: the formation of the CJD from the accreting gas onto Jupiter, the transport of solid materials from the circumstellar disc (CSD) to the CJD, and the formation of the satellites inside the CJD from the supplied materials. Recent 3D hydrodynamical simulations have revealed the basic structure of the CJD. However, the detailed structures, which influence the transport of materials and the formation of satellites, remain controversial. Specifically, for the transport of solid materials, pebbles (~cm-m) drifting from the outer region of the CSD are trapped at the gas gap created by Jupiter and cannot be directly supplied to the CJD. There are two alternative mechanisms for supplying solid material: small dust particles accrete onto the CJD together with the gas, or planetesimals, which are less affected by the gas, are captured by the CJD. The satellite formation scenarios are also divided into two groups: satellitesimal and pebble accretion. In both scenarios, the growth timescale of the satellites (~0.1-10 Myr) depends on the continuous supply of material to the CJD. How to stop the migration of forming satellites is also an important issue. The combination of inward migration and its cessation is consistent with the resonant orbits of the three innermost Galilean moons. The compositional gradient and the degree of differentiation of the moons further constrain the proposed formation scenarios. However, none of the proposed scenarios has been fully accepted, and future observations, such as those from the JUICE mission, will provide stricter constraints to define the true origin of Ganymede and the Galilean moons.</description>

      <title>K2-18b Does Not Meet The Standards of Evidence For Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K2-18b, a temperate sub-Neptune, has garnered significant attention due to claims of possible biosignatures in its atmosphere. Low-confidence detections of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) have sparked considerable debate, primarily around arguments that their absorption features are not uniquely identifiable. Here, we consider a different question from the astrobiology standards of evidence framework: Have we detected an authentic signal? To answer this, we analyzed previously-published, publicly-available JWST observations of K2-18b using independent data reduction and spectral retrieval frameworks. Our comprehensive set of reductions demonstrates that the MIRI transit spectrum is highly susceptible to unresolved instrumental systematics. Applying different wavelength binning schemes yields a potpourri of planet spectra that then lead to a wide assortment of atmospheric interpretations. Consequently, we offer recommendations to help minimize this previously-underappreciated instrument systematic in future MIRI reductions of any exoplanet. While the MIRI binning scheme adopted by Madhusudhan et al. (2025) supports a tentative detection of DMS/DMDS in K2-18b, we find that 87.5% of retrievals using our favored MIRI binning scheme do not. When considering the full, 0.7 - 12 micron transit spectrum, we confirm the detection of CH4 and CO2, and find the presence of DMS and C2H4 to be interchangeable. Moreover, we find that the tentative presence of large features in the MIRI transit spectrum is in tension with the more robust, yet smaller, features observed in the near IR. We conclude that red noise -- rather than an astrophysical signal -- plagues the mid-IR data and there is, as yet, no statistically significant evidence for biosignatures in the atmosphere of K2-18b.</description>

      <title>Formation of organic hazes in CO$_2$-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres within the graphite-stability regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are the most common exoplanets, with a "radius valley" suggesting that super-Earths may form by shedding sub-Neptunes' gaseous envelopes. Exoplanets that lie closer to the super-Earth side of the valley are more likely to have lost a significant fraction of their original H/He envelopes and become enriched in heavier elements with CO$_2$ gaining in abundance. It remains unclear which types of haze would form in such atmospheres, potentially significantly affecting spectroscopic observations. To investigate this, we performed laboratory simulations of two CO$_2$-rich gas mixtures (with 2000 times solar metallicity at 300 K and 500 K). We found that under plasma irradiation, organic hazes were produced at both temperatures with higher haze production rate at 300 K probably because condensation occurs more readily at lower temperature. Gas-phase analysis demonstrates the formation of various hydrocarbons, oxygen- and nitrogen-containing species, including reactive gas precursors like C$_2$H$_4$, CH$_2$O, and HCN, for haze formation. The compositional analysis of the haze particles reveals various functional groups and molecular formulas in both samples. The 500 K haze sample has larger average molecular sizes, higher degree of unsaturation with more double or triple bonds presence, and higher nitrogen content incorporated as N-H, C=N bonds, indicating different haze formation pathways. These findings not only improve the haze formation theories in CO$_2$-rich exoplanet atmospheres but also offer important implications for the interpretation of future observational data.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Atmospheric Carbon Species and Stellar Type on Climates of Terrestrial Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The climates of terrestrial planets are largely determined by the composition of their atmospheres and spectral types of their host stars. Previous studies suggest a wide range of carbon species abundances (CO\textsubscript{2}, CO, and CH\textsubscript{4}) can result from variations in reducing fluxes and stellar spectral types which influence photochemistry. However, a systematic investigation of how varying carbon species, particularly CO, affect planetary climates across wide parameter spaces remains limited. Here, we employ a one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium model to examine the dependence of planetary climate on the abundances of carbon species and host star type. We find that CO, due to weak absorption of stellar radiation, induces only moderate changes in stratospheric temperature, while its effect on surface temperature is negligible. Under Earth-like $p_\mathrm{N_2}$ (where $p_\mathrm{i}$ is the partial pressure on the surface of species i), for cases with fixed $p_\mathrm{CO_2}$, increase in CO leads to surface cooling on planets orbiting Sun-like stars unless the sum of $p_\mathrm{CO_2}$ and $p_\mathrm{CH_4}$ exceeds $\sim$1 bar. Whereas it results in surface warming for planets around M-type stars. When the total pressure of carbon species is fixed, converting CO\textsubscript{2} or CH\textsubscript{4} into CO always induces cooling. These effects arise from a combination of CO Rayleigh scattering, pressure broadening of greenhouse gas absorption lines, and \textcolor{red}{varying water vapor levels}. We further discuss how CO- and CH\textsubscript{4}-driven cooling (warming) can trigger positive (negative) climate-photochemistry feedback, influencing atmospheric evolution. Additionally, we suggest CO-rich planets may be less susceptible to water loss and atmospheric oxidation due to lower stratospheric water vapor content.</description>

      <title>Development of 1-D non-ideal MHD simulation code towards understanding Long-term Evolution of Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation code to investigate the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks with low computational cost. In this simulation code, the physical processes necessary for protostellar formation and protoplanetary disk evolution, such as magnetic braking, non-ideal MHD effects, and angular momentum transport due to viscosity, are implemented. Using this simulation code, we performed the simulations of the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks starting from the molecular cloud. Our simulation results suggest that the disk size and mass are a few tens of au and $\sim 0.01 M_\odot$ at $10^5$ years after protostellar formation. These values were relatively consistent with observations. The disk evolves through magnetic braking, and its radial profiles are consistent with the analytical solutions of previous studies. Our simulation code will be an important tool for studying the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Slantwise convection and heat transport in the icy moon oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean heat transport on icy moons shapes the ice shell topography, a primary observable of these moons. Two key processes control the heat transport: baroclinic instability driven by surface buoyancy contrasts and convective instability driven by heating from the core. However, global ocean simulations cannot accurately resolve convection under realistic icy moon conditions and instead often use Earth-based convective parameterizations, which capture only vertical convective mixing and cannot represent rotation-aligned slantwise convection on icy moons. We use high-resolution convection-resolving simulations to investigate ocean heat transport by slantwise convection in a parameter regime relevant to icy moons, isolated from baroclinic instability. Total heat transport follows the Coriolis-Inertial-Archimedean scaling with an added latitude dependence. The vertical transport increases with latitude, and the meridional transport is poleward. These results indicate that slantwise convection redistributes heat toward the poles, favoring a poleward-thinning ice shell, qualitatively consistent with Enceladus's observed ice thickness distribution.</description>

      <title>One-third of Sun-like stars are born with misaligned planet-forming disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets are organized in a broad array of orbital configurations that reflect their formation along with billions of years of dynamical processing through gravitational interactions. This history is encoded in the angular momentum architecture of planetary systems--the relation between the rotational properties of the central star and the orbital geometry of planets. A primary observable is the alignment (or misalignment) between the rotational axis of the star and the orbital plane of its planets, known as stellar obliquity. Hundreds of spin-orbit constraints have been measured for giant planets close to their host stars, many of which have revealed planets on misaligned orbits. A leading question that has emerged is whether stellar obliquity originates primarily from gravitational interactions with other planets or distant stars in the same system, or if it is primordial--imprinted during the star-formation process. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of primordial obliquities between the spin axes of young, isolated Sun-like stars and the orientation of the outer regions of their protoplanetary disks. Most systems are consistent with angular momentum alignment but about one-third of isolated young systems exhibit primordial misalignment. This suggests that some obliquities identified in planetary systems at older ages--including the Sun's modest misalignment with planets in the Solar System--could originate from initial conditions of their formation.</description>

      <title>A Markov Decision Process Framework for Early Maneuver Decisions in Satellite Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to model decision-making for collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) and a reinforcement learning policy gradient (RL-PG) algorithm to train an autonomous guidance policy using historic CAM data. In addition to maintaining acceptable collision risks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by making early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when to initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for conjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The Markov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the reliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which increases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation study on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average propellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On historical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant overall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both historical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal if not higher overall collision risk guarantees.</description>

      <title>Impact chronology of leftover planetesimals</title>

Abstract: After the formation of the Moon the terrestrial planets were pummelled by impacts from planetesimals left over from terrestrial planet formation. This work attempts to reproduce the impact rates set by modern crater chronologies using leftover planetesimals from three different dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation. I ran dynamical simulations for 1 billion years using leftover planetesimals from the Grand Tack, Depleted Disc and Implantation models of terrestrial planet formation with the GENGA N-body integrator. I fit the cumulative impacts on the Earth and Mars using a function that is a sum of exponentials with different weighing factors and e-folding times. Most fits require three or four terms. The fitted timescales cluster around t1=10 Myr, t2=35 Myr, t3=100 Myr and t4&gt;200 Myr. I attribute them to dynamical losses of planetesimals through different mechanisms: high-eccentricity Earth crossers and the nu6 secular resonance, Earth crossers, Mars crossers, and objects leaking on to Mars crossing orbits from beyond Mars. I place a constraint on the initial population using the known Archean terrestrial spherule beds, and I conclude that the Archean impacts were mostly created by leftover planetesimals. The inferred mass in leftover planetesimals at the time of the Moon's formation was about 0.015 Earth masses. The third time constant is comparable to that of modern crater chronologies. As such, the crater chronologies are indicative of impacts by an ancient population of Mars crossers. The initial perihelion distribution of the leftovers is a major factor in setting the rate of decline: to reproduce the current crater chronologies the number of Earth crossers at the time of the Moon's formation had to be at most half of the Mars crossers. These results together place constraints on dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the longstanding challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating classical Newtonian potential theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that improves both the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method employs Lie group theory and exponential mapping to characterize vector flows associated with rotational deformations. We derive functional equations for perturbations in density and gravitational potential, resolved analytically using the shift operator and Neumann series. This extends Clairaut's classical linear theory into the nonlinear regime. The resulting formulation yields an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing hydrostatic equilibrium under rotation without assuming slow rotation. This generalized Clairaut equation incorporates nonlinear effects and accommodates large rotational speeds. We validate the theory by deriving exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and the unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques to analyze radial harmonics of the shape function and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order spectral corrections and derive boundary conditions for radial harmonics. This enables accurate computation of Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments, offering a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational deformations in astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Attitude Determination and Control of GPS Satellites: Stabilization, Orbital Insertion, and Operational Control Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites are essential for providing accurate navigation and timing information worldwide. Operating in medium Earth orbit (MEO), these satellites must maintain precise Earth-pointing attitudes to transmit signals effectively. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the operational dynamics, attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), and orbital insertion techniques for GPS satellites. We explore the integration of sensors and actuators, control algorithms, stabilization strategies, and the launch procedures required to deploy these satellites. Key equations related to orbital mechanics and attitude control are discussed, and references to recent technical literature are included.</description>
