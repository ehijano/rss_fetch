      <title>Far-ultraviolet flares and variability of the young M dwarf AU Mic: a non-detection of planet c in transit at Lyman-alpha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape's potential to shape the exoplanet population motivates detailed observations of systems actively undergoing escape. AU Mic is a young and active M dwarf hosting two close-in transiting sub- to Neptune-sized planets. Atmospheric escape was previously detected on the inner planet b, with radially-blown neutral hydrogen producing ~30% blue-shifted absorption in Lyman-alpha. We obtained one HST/STIS transit of the outer planet c, to search for the planet's escaping atmosphere in transmission at Lyman-alpha and compare with AU Mic b. We detected 6 short-duration flares in Si IV and C IV, of which only one corresponded to a Lyman-alpha flare. We identified longer-duration stellar variability at the tens of percent level for lines less sensitive to stellar activity, including O I, C II and Lyman-alpha, which inhibits detection of an exosphere. We do not report absorption associated with an exosphere containing neutral hydrogen or any metals detectable in the far-ultraviolet, and discuss the implications of the non-detection. This work highlights the importance of 1) careful consideration of stellar variability in atmospheric escape observations, and 2) the dual-influence of photoionization and stellar wind when interpreting and modeling atmospheric escape.</description>

      <title>Wind shear and the role of eddy vapor transport in driving water convection on Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of convection in the jovian atmosphere have demonstrated that convection is strongly concentrated at specific locations on planet. For instance, observations of lightning show that the cyclonic features (e.g,. belts and folded filamentary regions - FFRs) show increased convective activity compared to anti-cyclonic regions. Meanwhile, the distribution of ammonia and water vapor show a large enrichment near the equator, which is also suggestive of strong upwelling and convective activity. Marrying these different observations is challenging due to a lack of data concerning the characteristics of the deep jovian atmosphere, and a resulting inability to observe the true deep source of the various convective phenomena. To understand the nature of these convective events and \paperedit{the role of the } structure of the deep atmosphere \paperedit{in driving convective events}, we run simulations of cloud formation and convection using the Explicit Planetary hybrid-Isentropic Coordinate General Circulation Model (EPIC GCM). We vary the dynamics of the atmosphere by parameterizing the deep wind shear and studying the resulting effect on the strength, frequency and distribution of convective storms. We find that convection in our model is strongly tied to the local dynamics and the deep wind shear. We further decompose the generation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) into three components (thermal, mechanical, and moist/chemical), and find that the chemical mechanism is the strongest component, working to advect water vapor from moisture-rich regions to moisture-poor regions and to drive convection along a ``moisture front.''</description>

      <title>Oort Cloud Formation and Evolution in Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is unknown if an Oort cloud reaches its maximum mass within its star's birth cluster or millions of years later. Complicating the Oort cloud evolution process is the fact that comets can be stripped from orbit due to perturbations from passing stars. We explore how a star's cluster escape time (t$_{ \rm esc}$) and the time its Oort cloud reaches maximum mass (t$_{ \rm max}$) affect the Oort cloud's ability to survive via $N$-body simulations. In a 14 M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ cluster, we identify 50 stars of 1 M$_\odot$ with a range of t$_{ \rm esc}$ to host Oort clouds, each with 1000 comets at t$_{ \rm max}$. For each host, we consider Oort clouds that reach maximum mass 0, 50, and 250 Myr after the cluster's formation. Each Oort cloud's evolution is simulated in the cluster from t$_{ \rm max}$ to t$_{ \rm esc}$. Only a fraction of comets tend to remain in orbit, with this amount depending on t$_{ \rm max}$ and t$_{ \rm esc}$. We observe that 12%, 22%, and 32% of Oort clouds with a t$_{ \rm max}$ of 0, 50 and 250 Myr retain &gt;50% of their comets at t$_{ \rm esc}$, respectively. We find that the fraction of comets stripped has the relationship, $\rm f=m\log_{10}(\frac{t_{ \rm esc}-t_{ \rm max}}{Myr})$ where m = 0.32$\pm$0.04, indicating that the longer the Oort cloud remains in the cluster, the more comets are stripped, with this fraction increasing logarithmically at approximately the same rate for each t$_{ \rm max}$.</description>

      <title>Grand Theft Moons. Formation of habitable moons around giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of the few thousand discovered exoplanets, a significant number orbit in the habitable zone of their star. Many of them are gas giants lacking a rocky surface and solid water reservoirs necessary for life as we know it. The search for habitable environments may extend to the moons of these giant planets. No confirmed exomoon discoveries have been made as of today, but promising candidates are known. Theories suggest that moon formation is a natural process in planetary systems. We aim to study moon formation around giant planets in a phase similar to the final assembly of planet formation. We search for conditions for forming the largest moons with the highest possibility in circumplanetary disks, and investigate whether the resulting moons can be habitable. We determined the fraction of the circumplanetary disk's mass converted into moons using numerical N-body simulations where moon embryos grow via embryo-satellitesimal collisions, investigated in disks around giant planets consisting of 100 fully interacting embryos and 1000 satellitesimals. In fiducial simulations, a 10 Jupiter-mass planet orbited a solar analog star at distances of 1-5 au. To determine the habitability of the synthetic moons, we calculated the stellar irradiation and tidal heating flux on these moons based on their orbital and physical parameters. The individual moon mass is found to be higher when the host planet orbits at a smaller stellar distance. However, moons leave the circumplanetary disk due to the stellar thief effect, which is stronger closer to the star. We find that 32% of synthetic moons can be habitable in the circumstellar habitable zone. Due to the intense tidal heating, the incidence rate of moon habitability is similar at 2 au, and decreasing to 1% at larger distances (&lt;5 au). We conclude that the circumstellar habitable zone can be extended to moons around giant planets.</description>

      <title>Probing the origins. II. Unravelling lithium depletion and stellar motion: Intrinsic stellar properties drive depletion, not kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Paper I, we classified a stellar sample from the thin disc with a broad range in metallicity as being churned outward or inward, or blurred/undisturbed. In this paper (Paper II), we delve deeper by analysing our entire metallicity-stratified sample along with their dynamic properties, focusing on the connection between radial migration and Li depletion. We analyse the chemo-dynamics of a set of 1188 thin disc dwarf stars observed by the \textit{Gaia}-ESO survey, previously classified into six metallicity-stratified groups via Hierarchical Clustering (HC). We examine several features, such as effective temperatures, masses, and dynamic properties. We also implement a parametric survival analysis using penalised splines (logistic distribution) to quantify how stellar properties and motion (or migration) direction jointly influence Li depletion patterns. We find that stars in our sample that appear to have churned outward are predominantly Li-depleted, regardless of their metallicities. These stars are also the oldest, coldest, and least massive compared to those in the same HC group that have either churned inward or kept their orbital radii. Our survival analysis confirms temperature as the primary driver of Li depletion, followed by metallicity and age, while migration direction shows negligible influence. The increasing proportion of outward-churned stars with higher metallicity (and older ages) indicates their dominant influence on the overall trend observed in the [Fe/H]-A(Li) space for stellar groups with [Fe/H]&gt;0. The survival model reinforces that the observed Li depletion stems primarily from intrinsic stellar properties (cool temperatures, higher metallicity, old ages) rather than migration history. This suggests the metallicity-dependent depletion pattern emerges through stellar evolution rather than Galactic dynamical processes.</description>

      <title>Cold day-side winds shape large leading streams in evaporating exoplanet atmospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of planetary atmospheres in HAT-P-32 b and HAT-P-67 b reveal extensive outflows reaching up to hundreds of planetary radii. The helium 1083 nm light curves for these planets, captured across their full orbits, show notable asymmetries: both planets display more pronounced pre-transit than post-transit absorptions, with HAT-P-67 b being the more extreme case of that geometry. Using three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations, we identify key factors influencing the formation of a dense leading outflow stream and characterize its morphology. Our models suggest that such a geometry of escaped material is caused by a relatively cold outflow of high mass-loss rate, launched preferentially from the planet's day side. From the simulations we calculate synthetic He I 1083 nm spectra that show large absorption depths and irregular line profiles due to complex gas kinematics. We find that the measurements of the He I 1083 nm equivalent width and the velocity shift relative to the planet's rest frame, observed over a significant portion of the planet's orbital phase, can provide important constraints on the outflow properties and its interaction with the stellar wind.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Luminosity and Mass as Limits to Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth remains the only known example of a planet with technology, and future projections of Earth's trajectory provide a basis and motivation for approaching the search for extraterrestrial technospheres. Conventional approaches toward projecting Earth's technosphere include applications of the Kardashev scale, which suggest the possibility that energy-intensive civilizations may expand to harness the entire energy output available to their planet, host star, or even the entire galaxy. In this study, we argue that the Kardashev scale is better understood as a "luminosity limit" that describes the maximum capacity for a civilization to harvest luminous stellar energy across a given spatial domain, and we note that thermodynamic efficiency will always keep a luminosity-limited technosphere from actually reaching this theoretical limit. We suggest the possibility that an advanced technosphere might evolve beyond this luminosity limit to draw its energy directly from harvesting stellar mass, and we also discuss possible trajectories that could exist between Earth today and such hypothetical "stellivores." We develop a framework to describe trajectories for long-lived technospheres that optimize their growth strategies between exploration and exploitation, unlike Earth today. We note that analyses of compact accreting stars could provide ways to test the stellivore hypothesis, and we more broadly suggest an expansion of technosignature search strategies beyond those that reside exactly at the luminosity limit.</description>

      <title>On the origin of Jupiter's fuzzy core: constraints from N-body, impact and evolution simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Jupiter's fuzzy core could be a result of a giant impact. Here, we investigate the expected impact conditions from N-body simulations. We then use state-of-the-art SPH simulations to investigate the results of impacts with different conditions including various impactor masses and composition, different formation stages in Jupiter's growth, and different resolutions. We next simulate the long-term thermal evolution of Jupiter post-impact. We find that 3D N-body simulations predict rather oblique impacts, and that head-on collisions are rare. Moreover, our results show that even under a head-on collision, Jupiter's fuzzy core cannot be formed. We next simulated Jupiter's thermal evolution and showed that unless post-impact temperatures are extremely low, a giant impact would not lead to an extended dilute core as inferred by interior models. We conclude that Jupiter's fuzzy core is not caused by an impact and is likely to be an outcome of its formation process.</description>
