      <title>Optically detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen-vacancy centers in microdiamonds inside nanopolycrystalline diamond anvil cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrated optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in microdiamonds inside a diamond anvil cell pressurized with nanopolycrystalline diamond (NPD) anvils. NPD exhibits high optical transparency, superior hardness, and low thermal conductivity, making it suitable for optical and spectroscopic measurements under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. We observed the ODMR signal from an ensemble of NV centers under high pressures, reaching up to 20 GPa, with a culet diameter of 600 $\mu$m. We also performed ODMR measurements on multiple microdiamonds sealed inside a sample chamber and found that the resonance frequency varied with the pressure distribution. The combination of NPD and microdiamonds containing NV centers is auspicious for pressure and magnetic imaging under concurrent high-pressure and high-temperature conditions.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-Induced Magnetoelectricity in Twisted Bilayer NiI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a promising route for multiferroic engineering, yet modeling large-scale moir\'e superlattices remains challenging. Leveraging a newly developed SpinGNN++ framework that effectively handles spin-lattice coupled systems, we develop a comprehensive interatomic machine learning (ML) potential and apply it to twisted bilayer NiI2 (TBN). Structural relaxation introduces moir\'e-periodic "bumps" that modulate the interlayer spacing by about 0.55~\AA{} and in-plane ionic shifts up to 0.48~\AA{}. Concurrently, our ML potential, which faithfully captures all key spin interactions, produces reliable magnetic configurations; combined with the generalized KNB mechanism, it yields accurate spin-driven polarization. For twist angles 1.89^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq 2.45^{\circ}, both mechanisms become prominent, yielding rich polarization textures that combine ionic out-of-plane dipoles with purely electronic in-plane domains. In the rigid (unrelaxed) bilayer, skyrmions are absent; lattice relaxation is essential for generating polar-magnetic topologies. In contrast, near {\theta} \approx 60^{\circ}, stacking-dependent ferroelectric displacements dominate, giving rise to polar meron-antimeron networks. These results reveal cooperative ionic and spin-driven ferroelectricity in TBN, positioning twisted vdW magnets as adaptable platforms for tunable multiferroic devices.</description>

      <title>Autferroicity: concept, candidates, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autferroicity is a newly proposed form of hybrid ferroicity, which is a sister branch of multiferroicity. It is characterized by the mutually exclusive magnetic and polar phases within a single system, giving a unique seesaw-type magnetoelectric coupling. This perspective provides a theoretical overview of its underlying concept, phase diagram characteristics, and representative candidates such as Ti-based trichalcogenide monolayers, while also highlighting its potential applications in nonvolatile memory devices and true random number generation.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition Under Control: Toward Application-Oriented Luminescence Thermometry and Thermally Activated Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-transition-based luminescent thermometers are characterized by two inherent limitations: a narrow thermal operating range and the presence of a hysteresis loop in the thermometric parameter. In this work, we demonstrate that controlling the particle size of LaGaO3:Eu3+ phosphors enables significant enhancement of thermometric performance. Specifically, a reduction in grain size dispersion leads to an increase in relative thermal sensitivity and significantly narrows the hysteresis loop. As a result of this approach, the relative sensitivity was increased to 18.2% K-1 for LaGaO3:Eu3+ synthesized via the solid-state method, compared to 3.0% K-1 for the counterpart prepared using the Pechini method. Furthermore, we show that the intentional incorporation of Al3+ and Sc3+ co-dopant ions allows for continuous tuning of the structural phase transition temperature from 165 K for 15% Al3+ to 491 K for 2% Sc3+, without significantly affecting the low-temperature spectroscopic properties of Eu3+ ions. This ability to shift the phase transition temperature in LaGaO3 offers a practical route to modulate the thermal response range of the luminescent thermometer, enabling its adaptation to specific application requirements. The empirical relationship established in this study between the phase transition temperature and the ionic radius mismatch parameter provides a predictive tool for the rational design of phase-transition-based phosphors with tailored thermometric performance. The ability to systematically tune the phase transition temperature via ionic radius mismatch, together with enhanced thermometric performance resulting from reduced grain size dispersion, establishes a coherent strategy for the rational design of high-sensitivity, low-hysteresis thermal sensors.</description>

      <title>Improving structure search with hyperspatial optimization and TETRIS seeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced structure prediction methods developed over the past decades include an unorthodox strategy of allowing atoms to displace into extra dimensions. A recently implemented global optimization of structures from hyperspace (GOSH) has shown promise in accelerating the identification of global minima on potential energy surfaces defined by simple interatomic models. In this study, we extend the GOSH formalism to more accurate Behler-Parrinello neural network (NN) potentials, make it compatible with efficient local minimization algorithms, and test its performance on nanoparticles and crystalline solids. For clusters modeled with NN potentials, four-dimensional optimization offers fairly modest improvement in navigating geometric relaxation pathways and incurs increased computational cost largely offsetting the benefit, but it provides a significant advantage in facilitating atom swaps in nanoalloys. In comparison, the introduction of a moderate, controlled bias for generating more physically sensible starting configurations, achieved via TETRIS-inspired packing of atomic blocks, has a more direct impact on the efficiency of global structure searches. The benchmarked systems are Lennard-Jones clusters, Au or Cu-Pd-Ag nanoparticles and binary Sn alloys described by NN potentials, and compounds with covalent B or BC frameworks modeled with density functional theory</description>

      <title>Extension of Second-Principles Density Functional Theory into the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the second-principles density functional theory (SPDFT) method to perform time-dependent simulations. Our approach, which calculates the evolution of the density matrix in real time and real space using the Liouville-von Neumann equation of motion, allows determining optical and transport properties for very large systems, involving tens of thousands of atoms, using very modest computational platforms. In contrast with other methods, we show that SPDFT can be applied to a wide variety of materials including both metals and insulators. In particular, we illustrate its capabilities by obtaining the spectra of SrTiO$_3$, diamond and metallic lithium. We find that, while SPDFT results in SrTiO$_3$ are quite similar to those obtained from DFT using linear perturbation theory, we observe significant improvements over this method in both diamond and metallic lithium. The inclusion of electron-electron interactions during the evolution of the density matrix in diamond allows the spectra to more closely resemble those obtained with the Bethe-Salpeter equation than from perturbation theory. In lithium time-dependent SPDFT not only predicts interband transitions but also the Drude peak, opening the possibility of detailed ab initio studies of transport properties beyond many of the usual approximations.</description>

      <title>Real time observation of glass-like carbon formation from SU-8 using X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural development and change in elemental composition of SU-8 3005 photoresist into glass-like carbon due to pyrolysis up to 1000~$\degree$C is investigated utilising \textit{in-situ} x-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV). XPS spectra were analysed in order to investigate changes to elemental composition and physical structure. Peak asymmetry in the measured C 1s spectra is found to be a clear indicator of a transition in both physical structure and increased electrical conductivity. The \textit{in-situ} XPS measurement of pyrolysis is effective in isolating changes in oxygen composition solely due to the pyrolysis process. Oxygen concentration, C 1s peak asymmetry and C 1s peak positions are strong indicators of semiconducting SU-8 transitioning to conducting glass-like carbon. For SU-8 pyrolysed above temperatures of 500~$\degree$C, a clear development is observed in the material structure and composition towards a carbon rich conducting network indicative of glass-like carbon. UPS spectra were analysed to investigate the changes in secondary electron cut-off (SECO) and valence band maximum (VBM) as the SU-8 layer is heated in UHV. The changes in SECO and VBM correlates well with the XPS data and a zero binding energy state is observed at 1000~$\degree$C.</description>

      <title>Ex Situ Fabrication of Superconducting Nanostructures for Low-Temperature STM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanofabrication enables flexible experimental design but is often incompatible with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) due to the latter's stringent surface quality requirements. Here, we present a fabrication strategy that combines ex situ nanolithography with in situ ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) cleaving to produce atomically clean, nanopatterned superconductor/topological insulator (TI) heterostructures suitable for high-resolution STM/STS. In our initial Design I, nanoribbons were defined by etching trenches into a TI film, followed by niobium capping and sample flipping before cleaving. This enabled STM/STS to be applied in large areas, although edge quality was limited by etch debris. To overcome this, we developed Design II, which avoids etching through the film by locally thinning it, leaving nanoscale ribbons raised above a continuous TI layer, followed again by Nb capping and sample flipping before cleaving. This method yields clean, reproducible nanostructures with well-defined superconducting gaps, demonstrating a reliable fabrication pathway for high-resolution STM/STS studies of nanoscale topological devices.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Order and Parametric Instabilities from First-Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shaping crystal structure with light is an enduring goal of physics and materials engineering. Here we present calculations in candidate materials selected by symmetry that allow light-induced spatiotemporal parametric instabilities. We demonstrate a theoretical framework that includes a complete symmetry analysis of phonon modes that contribute to parametric instabilities across all non-centrosymmetric point groups, a detailed survey of the materials landscape and finally the computation of nonlinear couplings from first principles. We then showcase detailed results for chiral crystals, ferroelectrics, and layered van der Waals materials. Our results pave the way towards realizing designer time-crystalline order in quantum materials, detectable with time-resolved diffractive probes.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger equation with Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and double well potential as model of vibrationally enhanced tunneling for proton transfer in hydrogen bond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A solution of the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and trigonometric double-well potential is obtained within the framework of the first-order of adiabatic approximation. The case of vibrational strong coupling is considered which is pertinent for polariton chemistry and (presumably) for enzymatic hydrogen transfer. We exemplify the application of the solution by calculating the proton transfer rate constant in the hydrogen bond of the Zundel ion ${\rm{H_5O_2^{+}}}$ (oxonium hydrate) within the framework of the Weiner's theory. An analytic formula is derived which provides the calculation of the proton transfer rate with the help of elements implemented in {\sl {Mathematica}}. The parameters of the model for the Zundel ion are extracted from the literature data on IR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The approach yields a vivid manifestation of the phenomenon of vibrationally enhanced tunneling, i.e., a sharp bell-shaped peak of the rate enhancement by the external vibration at its symmetric coupling to the proton coordinate. The results obtained testify that the effect of resonant activation in our model is robust and stable to variations in the types of the quadratically coupled mode (vibrational strong coupling or symmetric one).</description>

      <title>Physics-guided impact localisation and force estimation in composite plates with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-guided approaches offer a promising path toward accurate and generalisable impact identification in composite structures, especially when experimental data are sparse. This paper presents a hybrid framework for impact localisation and force estimation in composite plates, combining a data-driven implementation of First-Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) with machine learning and uncertainty quantification. The structural configuration and material properties are inferred from dispersion relations, while boundary conditions are identified via modal characteristics to construct a low-fidelity but physically consistent FSDT model. This model enables physics-informed data augmentation for extrapolative localisation using supervised learning. Simultaneously, an adaptive regularisation scheme derived from the same model improves the robustness of impact force reconstruction. The framework also accounts for uncertainty by propagating localisation uncertainty through the force estimation process, producing probabilistic outputs. Validation on composite plate experiments confirms the framework's accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in reducing dependence on large training datasets. The proposed method offers a scalable and transferable solution for impact monitoring and structural health management in composite aerostructures.</description>

      <title>SparseC-AFM: a deep learning method for fast and accurate characterization of MoS$_2$ with C-AFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b) our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes). SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research to industrial fabrication.

      <title>An indirect correlation of dielectric properties using optical trapping and dielectric resonance in two different frequency regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric permittivity, $\varepsilon_r$, of materials are often limited to a sub-GHz range using normal LCR meters. In the GHz range the $\varepsilon_r$ can be measured using Vector Network Analyzers and measurement jigs (waveguides) which are specific for different frequency regimes. Hence, to measure er for the entire frequency range one needs several components and is an extremely costly experiment. However, for applications such as Dielectric Resonator Antennas one need to know the er and the dielectric loss to estimate the resonant frequency. An indirect method is proposed in this letter to find the er from Transversely Misaligned Dual-Fiber Optical Trapping at the optical frequency range to approximately estimate {\epsilon}r and thereby understand the correlation between these two regimes of frequency responses.</description>

      <title>Investigation of competing magnetic orders and the associated spin-phonon coupling effect in quasi-2D Cr1+xTe2 (x = 0.22) single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single crystals of quasi-2D chromium telluride system represented by Cr1+xTe2 (x = 0.22), which crystallizes in the trigonal structure with the c-axis as the growth direction, are synthesized by the flux method. The magnetization measurements revealed the coexistence and competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions due to the presence of the intercalated Cr-layers. A series of diverse magnetic transitions is exhibited by the crystal. While cooling the crystal, it undergoes a paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition at 190 K, followed by a transition into a ferromagnetic state at around 160 K, and a spin-canting at a lower temperature of 75 K. A possible lack of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure, along with the observance of an unusual jump and loop opening in the isothermal magnetization suggests that the crystals Cr1+xTe2 (x = 0.22) may host skyrmions. Furthermore, concomitant to their magnetic transitions, anomalies were observed in the derived Breit-Wigner-Fano fit parameters obtained from the asymmetric temperature-dependent Raman spectra, evidencing a strong spin-phonon coupling effect, intrinsic to the grown crystals. A strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy along with the robust spin-phonon coupling, makes the system a promising candidate for prospective spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Fine-Tuning of Foundational Neural Network Potentials: A Bayesian Neural Network Approach</title>

Abstract: Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning. In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.</description>

      <title>Less is more: removing a single bond increases the toughness of elastic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the removal of a single bond affects the fracture behavior of triangular spring networks, whereby we systematically vary the position of the removed bond. Our simulations show that removing the bond has two contrasting effects on the fracture energy for initiation of crack propagation and on the fracture energy for failure of the entire network. A single missing bond can either lower or raise the initiation fracture energy, depending on its placement relative to the crack tip. In contrast, the failure fracture energy is always equal to or greater than that of a perfect network. For most initial placements of the missing bond, the crack path remains straight, and the increased failure fracture energy results from arrest at the point of maximum local fracture resistance. When the crack deviates from a straight path, we observe an even higher fracture energy, which we attribute primarily to crack bridging. This additional toughening mechanism becomes active only at low failure strains of the springs; at higher failure strains, the crack path tends to remain straight. Altogether, our results demonstrate that even a single bond removal can significantly enhance toughness, offering fundamental insights into the role of defects in polymer networks and informing the design of tough architected materials.</description>

      <title>Sizable superconducting gap and anisotropic chiral topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductors offer a fertile ground for realizing Majorana zero modes -- topologically protected, zero-energy quasiparticles that are resilient to local perturbations and hold great promise for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent studies have presented encouraging evidence for intrinsic topological superconductivity in the Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi$_2$, hinting at a robust surface phase potentially stable beyond the McMillan limit. However, due to substantial spatial variations in the observed superconducting (SC) gap $\Delta$ the nature of the underlying order parameter $\Delta$($k$) remained under debate. Here we report the realization of sizable surface SC gaps ($\Delta &gt; 10\,\mathrm{meV}$) in PtBi$_2$, exhibiting remarkable spatial uniformity from hundreds of nanometers down to the atomic level, as revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Building on this spatial homogeneity -- indicative of long-range phase coherence -- we uncover previously unobserved low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) that ubiquitously emerge within the SC gap across the surface. Theoretical simulations that closely reproduce the experimental spectra, reveal an anisotropic chiral pairing symmetry of $\Delta$($k$), and further suggest that the observed ABSs are of topological origin. The combination of a large, nontrivial pairing gap and accessible surface states establishes PtBi$_2$ as a compelling platform for investigating topological superconductivity and its associated Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Predicting temperature-dependent failure and transformation zones in 2D silica glass through quasistatic Gaussian Phase Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The athermal quasistatic (AQS) method is a powerful technique to study the mechanical behavior of disordered systems. However, its applicability is limited to temperatures near zero, where thermal activation is unlikely. In this work, we extend the AQS method to finite temperatures, based on a formulation that describes atoms as temperature-dependent Gaussian packets (GPPs) in phase space under quasistatic conditions, thus equivalent to minimum free energy conditions. This framework is used to study the effect of temperature on the onset of inelasticity and fracture in amorphous two-dimensional silica glass approaching quasistatic conditions under uniaxial tensile loading. An important characteristic of this formulation is the directional dependence of the variance of each Gaussian packet in configuration space, making this formulation an inexpensive and accurate predictor of zones prone to atomic-scale rearrangements, both in the undeformed state and (with increasing accuracy) as the deformation progresses. This method is also shown to accurately capture the thermal expansion of the disordered material. Furthermore, combining the GPP description with Metropolis sampling predicts the effect of temperature on the onset of fracture of the material, which is validated through MD simulations at strain rates as low as $10^{4}$s$^{-1}$. The presented framework therefore provides a valuable technique for studying the nonlinear mechanics of disordered materials at finite temperature and for predicting local rearrangement zones in disordered solids efficiently without the need for expensive MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Alignment behavior of 2D diopsides (d-silicates) under the influence of an AC electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz). Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations. Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible electronics, sensors, and energy devices.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Insulator and the Extended Falicov--Kimball Model Away from Half-Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an extended spinless Falicov--Kimball model at an arbitrary doping level, focusing on the range of parameter values where a uniform excitonic insulator is stabilised at half-filling. We compare the properties of possible uniform phases and construct the Hartree--Fock phase diagrams, which include sizeable phase separation regions. It is seen that the excitonic insulator can appear as a component phase in a mixed-phase state in a broad interval of doping levels. In addition, in a certain range of parameter values the excitonic metal (doped excitonic insulator) is identified as the lowest-energy uniform phase. We suggest that this phase, which is unstable with respect to phase separation, may be stabilised when the phase separation is suppressed by the long-range Coulomb interaction. Overall, we find that excitonic correlations can affect the behaviour of the system relatively far away from half-filling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We test Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory for elastoplastic solids, assuming a constant penetration hardness. Using a numerical model based on the boundary element method, we simulate the contact between a rough, rigid surface and an elastic-perfectly plastic half-space with a flat surface. The theory's predictions for elastic, plastic, and total contact area agree quantitatively with the numerical results. The simulations also support the boundary conditions assumed in the theory, namely that the stress probability vanishes at both zero and yield stress. These findings reinforce the validity of the theory for systems with constant hardness.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated altermagnet CaCrO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic phase, has spurred growing research activity. Studies from a perspective of dynamical electronic correlation still remain scarce. Employing density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) that incorporates dynamical electronic correlation, we demonstrate that CaCrO$_3$ is a strongly correlated altermagnet. Our DFT+DMFT calculations successfully reproduce the correlated metallic behavior of CaCrO$_3$ and quantitatively capture the incoherence state observed experimentally. We also identify that the altermagnetic CaCrO$_3$ is a Hund's metal with a non-Fermi liquid behavior. Moreover, we find that altermagnetism can induce flat bands, and these incipient flat bands are further promoted by the strong renormalization from Hundness, which drives a heavy-fermion behavior. Hence, we propose that Hund's metals provide an ideal platform for hosting novel strongly correlated altermagnetism. Our work will promote the study of strongly correlated altermagnetism physics.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces the calculation of spatially-resolved chord length distribution (SR-CLD) as an efficient approach for quantifying and visualizing non-uniform microstructures in heterogeneous materials. SR-CLD enables detailed analysis of spatial variation of microstructures in different directions that can be overlooked with traditional descriptions. We present the calculation of SR-CLD using efficient scan-line algorithm that counts pixels in constituents along pixel rows or columns of microstructure images for detailed, high-resolution SR-CLD maps. We demonstrate the application of SR-CLD in three case studies: on synthetic polycrystalline microstructures with known and intentionally created uniform and gradient spatial distributions of grain size; on non-uniform microstructures from welding simulations; and on experimental images of two-phase microstructures of additively manufactured Ti alloys with significant spatially non-uniform distributions of laths of one of the phases.</description>

      <title>Driving collective current excitations using light: The two-time $GW$ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a distinct transverse collective excitation, which we name the "curron", arising from current-current interactions in a driven quantum metal. Unlike plasmons, which involve longitudinal charge oscillations, currons are transverse current-density oscillations resulting from the interplay between the vector potential generated by the current and the external driving field. We demonstrate the emergence of this excitation in sodium metal by solving the Kadanoff-Baym equations on a complex time contour within the non-equilibrium two-time (TT) $GW$ formalism, marking, to our knowledge, the first TT-$GW$ calculation on a realistic material. We further show that two-time quantum memory effects leave measurable signatures: a pump-induced elevation in the baseline of the current-to-field response, potentially observable in polarization- and momentum-resolved conductivity experiments. By extracting effective resistive and memory coefficients from the TT-$GW$ dynamics, we introduce a generalized d'Alembert wave equation that captures the many-body damping and retardation inherent to driven quantum systems. These results establish current-current response functions as a platform to harness qualitatively new collective dynamics in correlated matter, opening new avenues for probing light-matter interactions beyond charge-density dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Neutron irradiation in structural alloys promotes defect clustering, which suppresses plasticity and triggers a ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT), a key degradation mechanism limiting fracture resistance in nuclear materials. This study investigates the fracture mechanisms underlying this transition in irradiated Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Using Molecular Dynamics simulations, we examine how different defect types influence crack propagation and energy dissipation mechanisms. The results reveal distinct roles of these defects: voids facilitate crack growth by reducing local cohesive energy, while dislocation loops act as barriers that impede crack advancement and redirect crack paths, significantly altering crack morphology. Building on the classical approach of separating fracture energy into brittle cleavage and plastic components, this study adapts the decomposition to irradiated materials. This framework quantifies the evolving contributions of surface energy and plastic work across increasing radiation damage levels, providing critical insight into how irradiation-induced defects govern fracture dynamics</description>

Abstract: We have successfully fabricated the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer on Ag(111) by evaporating Mn atoms onto (p x root3)-Bi/Ag(111) at room temperature. By using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM), we have resolved the magnetic triple-q (3Q) state. In combination with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the 3Q3-like spin texture is the magnetic ground state for the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer/Ag(111). Interestingly, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of 3Q3 state triggered by the bismuthene on top of Mn monolayer/Ag(111) has been revealed, which is consistent with the switching of 3Q3up and 3Q3down domains observed by SP-STM measurements with external magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate room-temperature nucleation and manipulation of topological spin textures in the van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2, through laser pulse excitation. By leveraging laser-induced heating and subsequent cooling, we access the skyrmion/bubble state at low fields and achieve toggle switching between two topological spin textures - skyrmion/bubble and labyrinth. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this switching behaviour arises from laser-induced heating and cooling. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW ferromagnets for room temperature laser-controlled non-volatile memory storage applications.</description>

However, since their discovery over ten years ago, ARPR responses in ALM flakes has exhibited a puzzling dependence on flake thickness, excitation wavelength, and dielectric environment, complicating their understanding and prediction. By taking black phosphorus (BP) (large than 20 nm) flakes and four-layer Td-WTe2 as examples, this study introduces intrinsic Raman tensors (Rint) and proposes strategies to predict the ARPR intensity profiles of thick and atomically-thin ALM flakes by considering birefringence, linear dichroism and multilayer interference inside multilayered structures with experimentally determined complex refractive indexes along in-plane axes and complex tensor elements of Rint for the corresponding phonon modes. The tensor elements of effective Raman tensors (Reff), which are directly linked to the polarization vectors of incident and scattered light outside the ALM surface, were derived to quantitatively predict ARPR intensity for these ALM flakes, showing intricate dependence on ALM thickness, dielectric substrates, and excitation wavelengths. This framework can be extended to other ALM flakes from atomically-thin layers to bulk limit, facilitating comprehensive prediction of their ARPR intensity regardless of layer-dependent electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Towards an exact electronic quantum many-body treatment of Kondo correlation in magnetic impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of a charge ice state in the doped Mott insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between strong electronic correlations and the inherent frustration of certain lattice geometries is a common mechanism for the formation of nontrivial states of matter. In this work, we theoretically explore the collective electronic effects in the monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a recently discovered triangular lattice Mott insulator. Our advanced many-body numerical simulations predict the emergence of a phase separation region upon doping this material. Notably, in close proximity to the phase separation, the static charge susceptibility undergoes a drastic change and reveals a distinctive bow-tie structure in momentum space. The appearance of such a fingerprint in the context of spin degrees of freedom would indicate the formation of a spin ice state. This finding allows us to associate the observed phase separation to a charge ice state, a state with a remarkable power law dependence of both the effective exchange interaction and correlations between electronic densities in real space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spherical Harmonic Gaussian type orbitals and Slater functions can be expressed using spherical coordinates or a linear combinations of the appropriate Cartesian functions. General expressions for the transformation coefficients between the two representations are provided. Values for the transformation coefficients are tabulated up to the quantum number $\ell = 10$. The formula is applied to construct the Hartree potential by an arbitrary-order multipole expansion.</description>

      <title>Evidence for spin liquid behavior in the frustrated three-dimensional $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(VO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a dynamical regime emerges, characterized by a dual response in the inelastic spectrum composed of short-live dispersive excitations and a quasi-elastic component. Strongly frustrated exchange interactions combined with subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects are a plausible mechanism to explain the origin of this spin-liquid behavior.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon Coupling in Correlated Metals: A Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong electron-electron interactions are known to significantly modify the electron-phonon coupling relative to the predictions of density functional theory, but this effect is challenging to calculate with realistic theories of strongly correlated materials. Here we define and calculate a version of the EPC applicable beyond band theory by combining first principles density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory with finite difference phonon perturbations, presenting results for several representative phonon modes in two materials of interest. In the three-orbital correlated metal SrVO$_3$, we find that intra-V-$t_{2g}$ band correlation significantly increases the coupling of these electrons to a Jahn-Teller phonon mode that splits the degenerate orbital energies, while slightly reducing the coupling associated with a breathing phonon that couples to the charge on each V atom. In the infinite layer cuprate CaCuO$_2$, we find that local correlation within the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital derived band has a modest effect on coupling of near-Fermi surface electrons to optical breathing modes. In both cases, the interaction correction to the electron-phonon coupling predicted by dynamical mean-field theory has a significant dependence on the electronic frequency, arising from a lattice-distortion dependence of the correlated electron dynamics, showing the inadequacy of the simple picture in which correlations change static local susceptibilities. We also show that the electron-phonon scattering and phonon lifetimes associated with these phonon modes are modified by the electronic correlation. Our findings shed light on the material- and mode-specific role of dynamical electronic correlation in electron-phonon coupling and highlight the importance of developing efficient computational methods for treating electron-phonon coupling in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>phaser: A unified and extensible framework for fast electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present \code{phaser}, an open-source Python package that provides a unified interface to both conventional and gradient descent-based ptychographic algorithms. Features such as mixed-state probe, probe position correction, and multislice ptychography make experimental reconstructions practical and robust. Reconstructions are specified in a declarative format and can be run from a command line, Jupyter notebook, or web interface. Multiple computational backends are supported to provide maximum flexibility. With the JAX computational backend, a six-fold improvement in iteration speed is achieved over a widely used package implemented in MATLAB, fold\_slice/PtychoShelves. We report reconstruction success for a variety of experimental datasets, and detail the effects of regularization on convergence and reconstruction quality. The software promises to speed the application and development of ptychographic methods for materials science.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Anatomy of Electron Angular Momenta Edge Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling electron's spin and orbital degrees of freedom has been a major research focus over the past two decades, as it underpins the electrical manipulation of magnetization. Leveraging a recently introduced quantum kinetic theory of multiband systems [T. Valet and R. Raimondi, Phys. Rev. B 111, L041118 (2025)], we outline how the intrinsic angular momenta linear response is partitioned into intraband and interband contributions. Focusing on time reversal and inversion symmetric metals, we show that the spin and orbital Hall currents are purely intraband. We also reveal that the edge densities originate partially, and in the orbital case mostly, from a new interband mechanism. We discuss how this profoundly impacts the interpretation of orbital edge accumulation observations, and has broader implications for our understanding of current induced torques.</description>
