      <title>Data-driven Analysis of First-Order Methods via Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of analyzing the probabilistic performance of first-order methods when solving convex optimization problems drawn from an unknown distribution only accessible through samples. By combining performance estimation (PEP) and Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO), we formulate the analysis as a tractable semidefinite program. Our approach unifies worst-case and average-case analyses by incorporating data-driven information from the observed convergence of first-order methods on a limited number of problem instances. This yields probabilistic, data-driven performance guarantees in terms of the expectation or conditional value-at-risk of the selected performance metric. Experiments on smooth convex minimization, logistics regression, and Lasso show that our method significantly reduces the conservatism of classical worst-case bounds and narrows the gap between theoretical and empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Calibration of Supplier Selection Problem in Freight Agent-Based Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freight transportation modeling often struggles with data limitations, especially in accurately representing complex supplier selection processes and their impact on network flows. This research addresses this critical gap by developing a large-scale, calibrated agent-based model for supplier selection, complemented by a probabilistic heuristic for international shipments. Our approach integrates trade relationships between industry sectors, transportation costs, and supplier rating model adapted from existing literature. The model's core objective is to minimize the discrepancy between modeled and observed commodity flows while ensuring a close match to regional shipping distance distributions. Implemented and tested across four major U.S. metropolitan areas, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Los Angeles, the model demonstrates high fidelity in replicating observed freight patterns. Key findings reveal consistent alignment with national shipping distance trends and highlight significant spatial variations in commodity trade assignments and demand across the study regions. This behaviorally informed and transport-sensitive framework is designed to approximate real-world decision-making, providing a robust tool for policymakers and planners to evaluate targeted interventions, assess infrastructure investments, and enhance supply chain resilience in the face of disruptions.</description>

      <title>Moduli space of optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric and operator-theoretic formalism viewing optimization algorithms as discrete connections on a space of update operators. Each iterative method is encoded by two coupled channels-drift and diffusion-whose algebraic curvature measures the deviation from ideal reversibility and determines the attainable order of accuracy. Flat connections correspond to methods whose updates commute up to higher order and thus achieve minimal numerical dissipation while preserving stability.
  The formalism recovers classical gradient, proximal, and momentum schemes as first-order flat cases and extends naturally to stochastic, preconditioned, and adaptive algorithms through perturbations controlled by curvature order. Explicit gauge corrections yield higher-order variants with guaranteed energy monotonicity and noise stability. The associated determinantal and isomonodromic formulations yield exact nonasymptotic bounds and describe acceleration effects via Painlev\'e-type invariants and Stokes corrections.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Term Sparsity in Symmetry-Adapted Basis for Polynomial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial optimization problems are infinite-dimensional, nonconvex, NP-hard, and are often handled in practice with the moment-sums of squares hierarchy of semidefinite programming bounds. We consider problems where the objective function and constraint polynomials are invariant under the action of a finite group. The present paper simultaneously exploits group symmetry and term sparsity in order to reduce the computational cost of the hierarchy. We first exploit symmetry by writing the semidefinite matrices in a symmetry-adapted basis according to an isotypic decomposition. The matrices in such a basis are block diagonal. Secondly, we exploit term sparsity on each block to further reduce the optimization matrix variables. This is a non-trivial extension of the term sparsity-based hierarchy related to sign symmetry that was introduced by two of the authors. Our method is compared with existing techniques via benchmarks on quartics with dihedral, cyclic and symmetric group symmetry.</description>

      <title>GPU-based Split algorithm for Large-Scale CVRPSD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet its inherently sequential structure has long limited its scalability in scenario-based stochastic programming (SP). This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated framework that reformulates a broad class of forward DP recursions as batched min-plus matrix-vector products over layered DAGs, collapsing actions into masked state-to-state transitions that map seamlessly to GPU kernels. Using this reformulation, our approach takes advantage of massive parallelism across both scenarios and transitions, enabling the simultaneous evaluation of \emph{over one million uncertainty realizations} in a single GPU pass -- a scale far beyond the reach of existing methods. We instantiate the framework in two canonical applications: the capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demand and a dynamic stochastic inventory routing problem. In both cases, DP subroutines traditionally considered sequential are redesigned to harness two- or three-dimensional GPU parallelism. Experiments demonstrate near-linear scaling in the number of scenarios and yield one to three orders of magnitude speedups over multithreaded CPU baselines, resulting in tighter SAA estimates and significantly stronger first-stage decisions under fixed time budgets. Beyond these applications, our work establishes a general-purpose recipe for transforming classical DP routines into high-throughput GPU primitives, substantially expanding the computational frontier of stochastic discrete optimization to the million-scenario scale.</description>

      <title>Delay-Optimal Transmission Scheduling Policies for Time-Correlated Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks have the potential to support high throughput and low-latency requirements of 5G-and-beyond communication standards. But transmissions in this band are highly vulnerable to attenuation and blockages from humans, buildings, and foliage, which increase end-to-end packet delays. This work designs dynamic scheduling policies that minimize end-to-end packet delays while keeping packet transmission costs low. Specifically, we consider a mmWave network that consists of a transmitter that transmits data packets over an unreliable communication channel modeled as a Gilbert-Elliott channel.The transmitter operates under an ACK/NACK feedback model and does not observe the channel state unless it attempts a transmission. The objective is to minimize a weighted average cost consisting of end-to-end packet delays and packet transmission costs. We pose this dynamic optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first POMDP formulation for mmWave network with partial channel state information that considers delay minimization. We show that the POMDP admits a solution that has a threshold structure, i.e., for each queue length, the belief (the conditional probability that the channel is in a good state) is partitioned into intervals, and the transmitter sends j packets when the belief lies in the j-th interval. We then consider the case when the system parameters such as the packet arrival rate, and the transition probabilities of the channel are not known, and leverage these structural results in order to use the actor-critic algorithm to efficiently search for a policy that is locally optimal.</description>

      <title>A Ternary Gamma Semiring Framework for Solving Multi-Objective Network Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shortest-path methods rely on binary tropical semirings $(\min,+)$, whose dyadic structure limits them to pairwise cost interactions. However, many real-world systems, including logistics, supply chains, communication networks, and reliability-aware infrastructures, exhibit inherently ternary dependencies among cost, time, and risk that cannot be decomposed into pairwise components.
  This paper introduces the \emph{Ternary Tropical Gamma Semiring} (TTGS), a $\Gamma$-indexed algebraic structure that generalizes tropical semirings by replacing binary additive composition with a non-separable ternary operator. We establish the axioms of TTGS, prove associativity, distributivity, and monotonicity, and show that TTGS forms a well-structured foundation for multi-parameter optimization.
  Building on this framework, we develop TTGS-Pathfinder, a ternary analogue of the Bellman--Ford algorithm. We derive its dynamic-programming recurrence, prove correctness through an invariant-based argument, analyze convergence under the TTGS order, and obtain an $O(n^2 m)$ complexity bound.
  Applications demonstrate that TTGS naturally models systems whose behaviour depends on triadic cost interactions, offering a principled alternative to binary tropical, vector, or scalarized multi-objective methods.</description>

      <title>Fast-Forwarding Stalling in Dykstra's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained quadratic programs and Euclidean projections are ubiquitous in engineering, arising in machine learning, estimation, control, and signal processing. Dykstra's algorithm is an iterative scheme for computing the Euclidean projection of an initial point onto the intersection of convex sets by successively projecting onto each set. Its low per-iteration computational cost makes it well-suited for solving large-scale or real-time problems where traditional optimisation routines become computationally burdensome. Despite its strong convergence guarantees, Dykstra's algorithm is known to suffer from stalling -- arbitrarily long intervals during which the primal iterates remain constant -- rendering its runtime unpredictable and severely limiting its applicability in time-critical settings. Focusing on polyhedral constraint sets, we derive a closed-form solution for the length of the stalling period once stalling is detected. This result enables a modified, stall-averse version of Dykstra's algorithm that fast-forwards the stalling period via a single, inexpensive update while preserving convergence guarantees. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence behaviour, establishing the proposed method as a practical enhancement for a broad class of projection-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimality Conditions and Duality for Multiobjective Fractional Bilevel Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a multiobjective bilevel optimization problem where each objective is a fractional function. By reformulating the problem into a single-level one, we establish refined necessary and sufficient optimality conditions. These results are derived using ${\partial}_D$-nonsmooth Abadie-type constraint qualifications and generalized convexity concepts (quasiconvexity and pseudoconvexity) based on directional convexificators. We also prove weak and strong duality theorems for a Mond-Weir dual problem formulated with directional convexificators. Finally, several examples are provided to illustrate the advantages of our approach.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Routing for Electric Vehicles under Acceleration and Load Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an Acceleration and Load-Dependent Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (ALD-EVRP), to optimize the energy consumption (EC) while capturing the effects of changing traffic conditions between peak and off-peak periods. We generalize the time-dependent speed model by replacing step functions with piecewise linear functions. The EC of each vehicle is influenced by its speed, acceleration, and real-time load. A mathematical model is developed and solved using BonMin, and a custom meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed for large-scale problems, yielding the same results as BonMin on small problems and performing better on larger ones. This is validated with real data from Singapore.</description>

      <title>On Linear Convergence of Distributed Stochastic Bilevel Optimization over Undirected Networks via Gradient Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many large-scale constrained optimization problems can be formulated as bilevel distributed optimization tasks over undirected networks, where agents collaborate to minimize a global cost function while adhering to constraints, relying only on local communication and computation. In this work, we propose a distributed stochastic gradient aggregation scheme and establish its linear convergence under the weak assumption of global strong convexity, which relaxes the common requirement of local function convexity on the objective and constraint functions. Specifically, we prove that the algorithm converges at a linear rate when the global objective function (and not each local objective function) satisfies strong-convexity. Our results significantly extend existing theoretical guarantees for distributed bilevel optimization. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments on distributed sensor network problems and distributed linear regression with rank-deficient data.</description>

      <title>The SCIP Optimization Suite 10.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SCIP Optimization Suite provides a collection of software packages for mathematical optimization, centered around the constraint integer programming (CIP) framework SCIP. This report discusses the enhancements and extensions included in SCIP Optimization Suite 10.0. The updates in SCIP 10.0 include a new solving mode for exactly solving rational mixed-integer linear programs, a new presolver for detecting implied integral variables, a novel cut-based conflict analysis and separator for flower inequalities, two new heuristics, a novel tool for explaining infeasibility, a new interface for nonlinear solvers as well as improvements in symmetry handling, branching strategies, and SCIP's Benders' decomposition framework. SCIP Optimization Suite 10.0 also includes new and improved features in the the presolving library PaPILO, the parallel framework UG, and the decomposition framework GCG. Moreover, the SCIP Optimization Suite 10.0 contains MIP-DD, the first open-source delta debugger for mixed-integer programming solvers. These additions and enhancements have resulted in an overall performance improvement of SCIP in terms of solving time, number of nodes in the branch-and-bound tree, as well as the reliability of the solver.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic detection of false data injection attacks in cyber-physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces an anomaly detection based algorithm (AD-CPS) to detect false data injection attacks that fall under the category of data deception/integrity attacks, but with arbitrary information structure, in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) modeled as stochastic linear time-invariant systems. The core idea of this data-driven algorithm is based on the fact that an honest state (one not compromised by adversaries) generated by the CPS should concentrate near its weighted empirical mean of the immediate past samples. As the first theoretical result, we provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the false positive error incurred by the algorithm for attacks that are 2-step honest, referring to adversaries that act intermittently rather than successively. Moreover, we establish that for adversaries possessing a certain minimum energy, the false negative error incurred by AD-CPS is low. Extensive experiments were conducted on partially observed stochastic LTI systems to demonstrate these properties and to quantitatively compare AD-CPS with an optimal CUSUM-based test.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control of heterogeneous mean-field stochastic differential equations with common noise has not been addressed in the literature. In this work, we initiate the study of such models. We formulate the problem within a linear-quadratic framework, a particularly important class in control theory, typically renowned for its analytical tractability and broad range of applications. We derive a novel system of backward stochastic Riccati equations on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. As this system is not covered by standard theory, we establish existence and uniqueness of solutions. We explicitly characterize the optimal control in term of the solution of such system. We apply these results to solve two problems arising in mathematical finance: optimal trading with heterogeneous market participants and systemic risk in networks of heterogeneous banks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in this paper a forward-backward-forward dynamical system for solving a mixed variational inequality problem in a real Hilbert space. For the convergence analysis of our proposed system, we apply the Lyapunov analysis to obtain the weak convergence of the generated trajectories when the associated operator is Lipschitz continuous and satisfies the general monotonicity condition. We also assume that the involved real-valued convex function satisfies some mild assumptions. Furthermore, the Lipschitz continuous operator is taken to be $h-$strongly pseudomonotone to establish the global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of the system for all the orbits generated. Finally, we present some numerical examples which illustrate how the trajectories of the proposed system converge to the equilibrium point of the proposed dynamical system.</description>

Abstract: We propose in this work a subgradient extragradient method with inertial and correction terms for solving equilibrium problems in a real Hilbert space. We obtain that the sequence generated by our proposed method converges weakly to a point in the solutions set of the equilibrium problem when the associated bivariate function is pseudomonotone and satisfies Lipschitz conditions. Furthermore, in a case where the bifunction is strongly pseudomonotone, we establish a linear convergence rate. Lastly, through different numerical examples, we demonstrate that the incorporation of multiple correction terms significantly improves our proposed method when compared with other methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>Proximal and Contraction method with Relaxed Inertial and Correction Terms for Solving Mixed Variational Inequality Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose in this paper a proximal and contraction method for solving a convex mixed variational inequality problem in a real Hilbert space. To accelerate the convergence of our proposed method, we incorporate an inertial extrapolation term, two correction terms, and a relaxation technique. We therefore obtain a weak convergence result under some mild assumptions. Finally, we present numerical examples to practically demonstrate the effectiveness of the relaxation technique, the inertial extrapolation term, and the correction terms in our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Techniques for Learning Optimal Classification Trees with Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees are a popular machine learning model which are traditionally trained by heuristic methods. Massive improvements in computing power and optimisation techniques has led to renewed interest in learning globally optimal decision trees. Empirical evidence shows that optimal classification trees (OCTs) have better out-of-sample performance than heuristic methods. The dominant optimisation paradigms for training OCTs are mixed-integer programming (MIP) and dynamic programming (DP). MIP formulations offer flexibility in the objectives and constraints that are modelled, but suffer from poor scaling in the size of the training dataset and the maximum tree depth. DP models represent the state of the art in scaling for OCTs, but lack some of the flexibility of MIP models. In this paper we present progress on using advanced integer programming methods to integrate ideas from DP models into MIP formulations to begin bridging the scaling gap. Using the existing BendOCT model from the literature as a base model, we introduce valid inequalities, cutting planes, and a primal heuristic to improve the scaling of MIP formulations. We show that these techniques significantly improve the ability of BendOCT to find provably optimal solutions over a wide range of datasets.</description>

      <title>An Axiomatic Analysis of Distributionally Robust Optimization with $q$-Norm Ambiguity Sets for Probability Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the axiomatic properties of a class of probability estimators derived from Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with $q$-norm ambiguity sets ($q$-DRO), a principled approach to the zero-frequency problem. While classical estimators such as Laplace smoothing are characterized by strong linearity axioms like Ratio Preservation, we show that $q$-DRO provides a flexible alternative that satisfies other desirable properties. We first prove that for any $q \in [1, \infty]$, the $q$-DRO estimator satisfies the fundamental axioms of Positivity and Symmetry. For the case of $q \in (1, \infty)$, we then prove that it also satisfies Order Preservation. Our analysis of the optimality conditions also reveals that the $q$-DRO formulation is equivalent to the regularized empirical loss minimization.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Rational Polynomial State Feedback Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the desirable objectives in feedback control design is to formulate and solve the design problem as an optimisation problem that is convex, so that an optimal solution can be found efficiently. Unfortunately many control design problems are non-convex: approximations, relaxations, or iterative schemes are usually employed to solve them. Several such approaches have been developed in the literature, for example Sum-of-Squares (SOSs) methods have been used for systems described by polynomial dynamics. Alternatively, and relevant to this paper, one can choose a (non-unique) linear-like representation of the system and solve the resulting state-dependent Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) or use SOSs optimisation techniques to derive a control law. This SOS method has been shown to effectively design polynomial and rational controllers for nonlinear polynomial systems, offering a broader class of controllers and the potential for improved performance and robustness guarantees. In this paper, we start off by considering rational functions as controllers for nonlinear systems and propose a procedure for designing such controllers by iteratively solving convex SOS optimisation problems. Our approach decouples the controller structure from the system dynamics and incorporates it as a constraint within the optimisation problem, which results in an optimisation that co-designs aspects of the controller and the Lyapunov function at the same iterative step. We theoretically establish the properties of this procedure by showing that several existing rational controller design methods can be recovered as special cases of this procedure. The proposed method is evaluated on various nonlinear benchmark system examples, demonstrating improved performance and robustness over both polynomial controllers and rational controllers obtained by existing approaches.</description>

      <title>A Trust-region Funnel Algorithm for Grey Box Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grey-box optimisation, where some parts of an optimisation problem are represented by explicit algebraic (glass-box) models while others are treated as black-box models lacking analytic derivatives, remains a challenge in process systems engineering. Trust-region (TR) methods provide a robust framework for grey-box problems by combining accurate glass-box derivatives with local reduced models (RMs) for black-box components. However, existing TR approaches often involve complex multi-layered formulations requiring extensive parameter tuning, or lack open-source implementations. Motivated by the recent advances in funnel-based convergence theory for nonlinear optimisation and the TR filter method, we propose a novel TR funnel algorithm for grey-box optimisation that replaces the filter acceptance criterion with a generalisable uni-dimensional funnel, maintaining a monotonically non-increasing upper bound on approximation error of the local black-box RMs. A global convergence proof to a first-order critical point is established. The algorithm, implemented in an open-source Pyomo framework, supports multiple RM forms and globalisation strategies (filter or funnel). Benchmark tests on seven numerical and engineering problems show that the TR funnel algorithm achieves comparable and often improved performance relative to the classical TR filter method. The TR funnel method thus provides a simpler, and extensible alternative for large-scale grey-box optimisation.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Mean Field Games on Networks and Related Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of deterministic mean field games and related optimal control problems, with a finite time horizon and in which the state space is a network.
  An agent controls her velocity, and, when she occupies a vertex, she can either remain still or enter any adjacent edge. The running and terminal costs are assumed to be continuous in each edge, but may jump at the vertices. Compared to the companion paper [4], we make more general assumptions about the costs and consider networks with an arbitrary number of vertices; this higher degree of generality brings new difficulties.
  For the optimal control problems mentioned above, we obtain in particular the existence of optimal trajectories and regularity results concerning the optimal trajectories and the value function.
  These control theoretic results make it possible to address a class of mean field games on networks, with costs that do not depend separately on the control and on the distribution of states, and that are non-local with respect to the latter. Focusing on a Lagrangian formulation, we obtain the existence of relaxed equilibria consisting of probability measures on admissible trajectories. To any relaxed equilibrium corresponds a mild solution, i.e. a pair $(u, m)$ made of the value function $u$ of a related optimal control problem and a family $m = (m(t))_t$ of probability measures on the network. Given $m$, the value function $u$ is a viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi problem on the network. We then investigate the regularity properties of $u$ and a weak form of a Fokker-Planck equation satisfied by $m$.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval via overparametrized nonconvex optimization: nonsmooth amplitude loss landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonconvex optimization for phase retrieval and the more general problem of semidefinite low-rank matrix sensing; in particular, we focus on the global nonconvex landscape of overparametrized versions of the nonsmooth amplitude least-squares loss as well as a smooth reformulation of this loss based on the PhaseCut approach. We first give a general, deterministic result on properties of second-order critical points for a general class of loss functions; we then specialize this result to the nonsmooth amplitude loss and, additionally, prove nearly identical results for a smooth reformulation (similar to PhaseCut) as a synchronization problem over spheres. Finally, we show the usefulness of these tools by proving high-probability landscape guarantees in two settings: (1) phase retrieval with isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, and (2) phase retrieval in a general (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space with Gaussian measurements. In both cases, our results give state-of-the-art and statistically optimal guarantees with only a constant amount of overparametrization (in the well-studied case of isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, such statistical guarantees had previously required greater degrees of overparametrization/relaxation); this demonstrates the potential of overparametrized nonconvex optimization as a principled and scalable algorithmic approach to phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>Quotient Manifold Optimization for Spectral Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral compressed sensing involves reconstructing a spectral-sparse signal from a subset of uniformly spaced samples, with applications in radar imaging and wireless channel estimation. By fully exploiting the signal structures, this problem is formulated as a rank-constrained semidefinite program subject to Hankel-Toeplitz structural constraints in our previous work. To further enhance computational efficiency, this paper proposes a quotient-manifold-based optimization framework that leverages the underlying Riemannian geometry in a matrix factorization space. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between spectral-sparse signals and matrix equivalence classes under the action of the real orthogonal group, where each class member corresponds to a rank-constrained positive-semidefinite Hankel-Toeplitz structured matrix. The associated quotient manifold geometry--including the Riemannian metric, horizontal space, retraction, and vector transport--is rigorously derived. Based on these results, we develop a Riemannian conjugate gradient descent algorithm, where each iteration is efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) by exploiting the Hankel and Toeplitz structures. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in both computational speed and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A double iteratively reweighted algorithm for solving group sparse nonconvex optimization models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a double iteratively reweighted algorithm to solve nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, where both the objectives and constraint functions are formulated by concave compositions to promote group-sparse structures. At each iteration, we combine convex surrogate with first-order information to construct linearly constrained subproblems to handle the concavity of model. The corresponding subproblems are then solved by alternating direction method of multipliers to satisfy the specific stop criteria. In particular, under mild assumptions, we prove that our algorithm guarantees the feasibility of each subsequent iteration point, and the cluster point of the resulting feasible sequence is shown to be a stationary point. Additionally, we extend the group sparse optimization model, pioneer the application of the double iterative reweighted algorithm to solve constrained group sparse models (which exhibits superior efficiency), and incorporate a generalized Bregman distance to characterize the algorithm's termination conditions. Preliminary numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the decentralized optimization problem of minimizing a finite sum of continuously differentiable and possibly nonconvex functions over a fixed-connected undirected network. We propose a unified decentralized nonconvex algorithmic framework that subsumes existing state-of-the-art gradient tracking algorithms and particularly several quasi-Newton algorithms. We present a general analytical framework for the convergence of our unified algorithm under both nonconvex and the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz condition settings. We also propose some quasi-Newton variants that fit into our framework, where economical implementation strategies are derived for ensuring bounded eigenvalues of Hessian inverse approximations. Our numerical results show that these newly developed algorithms are very efficient compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms for solving decentralized nonconvex smooth optimization.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a Z-control strategy for multi-agent systems of arbitrary order, aimed at driving the agents toward consensus in the highest-order observable state. The proposed framework supports both direct and indirect control schemes, making it applicable in scenarios where high-order derivatives such as acceleration cannot be directly manipulated. Theoretical analysis ensures exponential convergence while preserving the average dynamics, and a hierarchy of control laws is derived accordingly. Numerical experiments up to third-order models, including opinion dynamics and Cucker-Smale flocking systems, demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of Z-control under varying interaction regimes and control intensities.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear MPC for Feedback-Interconnected Systems: a Suboptimal and Reduced-Order Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a suboptimal and reduced-order Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture for discrete-time feedback-interconnected systems. The numerical MPC solver: (i) acts suboptimally, performing only a finite number of optimization iterations at each sampling instant, and (ii) relies only on a reduced-order model that neglects part of the system dynamics, either due to unmodeled effects or the presence of a low-level compensator. We prove that the closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of the suboptimal and reduced-order MPC optimizer with the full-order plant has a globally exponentially stable equilibrium point. Specifically, we employ timescale separation arguments to characterize the interaction between the components of the feedback-interconnected system. The analysis relies on an appropriately tuned timescale parameter accounting for how fast the system dynamics are sampled. The theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations on a mechatronic system consisting of a pendulum actuated by a DC motor.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Weak Orders via Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rank aggregation problems aim to combine multiple individual orderings of a common set of items into a consensus ranking that best reflects the collective preferences. This paper introduces a general Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework to model and solve, in an exact way, problems whose solutions are weak orders (a.k.a.\ bucket orders). Within this framework, we consider additional relevant constraints to produce the consensus bucket order, considering configurations with a fixed number of buckets, predefined bucket sizes, top-$k$ type problems, and fairness constraints. All these formulations are developed in a general setting, allowing their application to different rank aggregation contexts. One of these problems is the Optimal Bucket Order Problem (OBOP), for which we propose for the first time an exact formulation and test the variants proposed. The computational study includes, on the one hand, a comparison between the exact results obtained by our models and the heuristic methods proposed by Aledo et al.\ (2018), and on the other hand, an additional evaluation of their performance on a representative set of instances from the PrefLib library. The results confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach, providing a solid foundation for future research on rank aggregation problems with weak orders as consensus rankings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an unconstrained continuous optimization problem where, in each iteration, gradient estimates may be arbitrarily corrupted with a probability greater than 1/2. Additionally, function value estimates may exhibit heavy-tailed noise. This setting captures challenging scenarios where both gradient and function value estimates can be unreliable, making it applicable to many real-world problems, which can have outliers and data anomalies. We introduce an algorithmic and analytical framework that provides high-probability bounds on iteration complexity for this setting. The analysis offers a unified approach, encompassing methods such as line search and trust region.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms developed under stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often face challenges in non-stationary environments, and infinite-horizon formulations may not directly apply to finite-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce the Non-stationary and Varying-discounting MDP (NVMDP) framework, which naturally accommodates non-stationarity and allows discount rates to vary with time and transitions. Infinite-horizon, stationary MDPs emerge as special cases of NVMDPs for identifying an optimal policy, and finite-horizon MDPs are also subsumed within the NVMDP formulations. Moreover, NVMDPs provide a flexible mechanism to shape optimal policies, without altering the state space, action space, or the reward structure. We establish the theoretical foundations of NVMDPs, including assumptions, state- and action-value formulation and recursion, matrix representation, optimality conditions, and policy improvement under finite state and action spaces. Building on these results, we adapt dynamic programming and generalized Q-learning algorithms to NVMDPs, along with formal convergence proofs. For problems requiring function approximation, we extend the Policy Gradient Theorem and the policy improvement bound in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), offering proofs in both scalar and matrix forms. Empirical evaluations in a non-stationary gridworld environment demonstrate that NVMDP-based algorithms successfully recover optimal trajectories under multiple reward and discounting schemes, whereas original Q-learning fails. These results collectively show that NVMDPs provide a theoretically sound and practically effective framework for reinforcement learning, requiring only minor algorithmic modifications while enabling robust handling of non-stationarity and explicit optimal policy shaping.</description>

      <title>Frugality in second-order optimization: floating-point approximations for Newton's method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimizing loss functions is central to machine-learning training. Although first-order methods dominate practical applications, higher-order techniques such as Newton's method can deliver greater accuracy and faster convergence, yet are often avoided due to their computational cost. This work analyzes the impact of finite-precision arithmetic on Newton steps and establishes a convergence theorem for mixed-precision Newton optimizers, including "quasi" and "inexact" variants. The theorem provides not only convergence guarantees but also a priori estimates of the achievable solution accuracy. Empirical evaluations on standard regression benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform Adam on the Australian and MUSH datasets. The second part of the manuscript introduces GN_k, a generalized Gauss-Newton method that enables partial computation of second-order derivatives. GN_k attains performance comparable to full Newton's method on regression tasks while requiring significantly fewer derivative evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional continuous-domain inverse problems are often solved by the minimization of a loss functional, formed as the sum of a data fidelity and a regularization. In this work, we present a new construction where the regularization is itself built as the sum of two terms: i) the M norm of the regularizing operator L1 b L2, with L1 and L2 being two one-dimensional differential operators; ii) a bounded-variation norm that regularizes on the infinite-dimensional nullspace of L1 b L2. In this construction, we show that the extreme points of the solution set are the tensor product of one-dimensional splines, with a number of atoms upper-bounded in term of the number of data points. Further, when the data of the inverse problem is localized, we reveal that the term ii) must take the form of a sum of bounded-variation norms, precomposed with partial derivative of different orders.</description>

      <title>Divergence-Minimization for Latent-Structure Models: Monotone Operators, Contraction Guarantees, and Robust Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a divergence-minimization (DM) framework for robust and efficient inference in latent-mixture models. By optimizing a residual-adjusted divergence, the DM approach recovers EM as a special case and yields robust alternatives through different divergence choices. We establish that the sample objective decreases monotonically along the iterates, leading the DM sequence to stationary points under standard conditions, and that at the population level the operator exhibits local contractivity near the minimizer. Additionally, we verify consistency and $\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks. The results clarify connections to MM and proximal-point methods and offer practical defaults, making DM a drop-in alternative to EM for robust latent-structure inference.</description>

      <title>Accelerated optimization of measured relative entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measured relative entropy and measured R\'enyi relative entropy are quantifiers of the distinguishability of two quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$. They are defined as the maximum classical relative entropy or R\'enyi relative entropy realizable by performing a measurement on $\rho$ and $\sigma$, and they have interpretations in terms of asymptotic quantum hypothesis testing. Crucially, they can be rewritten in terms of variational formulas involving the optimization of a concave or convex objective function over the set of positive definite operators. In this paper, we establish foundational properties of these objective functions by analyzing their matrix gradients and Hessian superoperators; namely, we prove that these objective functions are $\beta$-smooth and $\gamma$-strongly convex / concave, where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ depend on the max-relative entropies of $\rho$ and $\sigma$. A practical consequence of these properties is that we can conduct Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent / ascent, a well known classical optimization technique, to calculate the measured relative entropy and measured R\'enyi relative entropy to arbitrary precision. These algorithms are generally more memory efficient than our previous algorithms based on semi-definite optimization [Huang and Wilde, arXiv:2406.19060], and for well conditioned states $\rho$ and $\sigma$, these algorithms are notably faster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a variant of Sparse Polyak for high dimensional M-estimation problems. Sparse Polyak proposes a novel adaptive step-size rule tailored to suitably estimate the problem's curvature in the high-dimensional setting, guaranteeing that the algorithm's performance does not deteriorate when the ambient dimension increases. However, convergence guarantees can only be obtained by sacrificing solution sparsity and statistical accuracy. In this work, we introduce a variant of Sparse Polyak that retains its desirable scaling properties with respect to the ambient dimension while obtaining sparser and more accurate solutions.</description>

      <title>Superhedging under Proportional Transaction Costs in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the well-studied superhedging problem under proportional transaction costs in continuous time using the recently developed tools of set-valued stochastic analysis. By relying on a simple Black-Scholes-type market model for mid-prices and using continuous trading schemes, we define a dynamic family of superhedging sets in continuous time and express them in terms of set-valued integrals. We show that these sets, defined as subsets of Lebesgue spaces at different times, form a dynamic set-valued risk measure with multi-portfolio time-consistency. Finally, we transfer the problem formulation to a path-space setting and introduce approximate versions of superhedging sets that will involve relaxing the superhedging inequality, the superhedging probability, and the solvency requirement for the superhedging strategy with a predetermined error level. In this more technical framework, we are able to relate the approximate superhedging sets at different times by means of a set-valued Bellman's principle, which we believe will pave the way for a set-valued differential structure that characterizes the superhedging sets.</description>

      <title>Tail Distribution of Regret in Optimistic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive instance-dependent tail bounds for the regret of optimism-based reinforcement learning in finite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes with unknown transition dynamics. Focusing on a UCBVI-type algorithm, we characterize the tail distribution of the cumulative regret $R_K$ over $K$ episodes, rather than only its expectation or a single high-probability quantile. We analyze two natural exploration-bonus schedules: (i) a $K$-dependent scheme that explicitly incorporates the total number of episodes $K$, and (ii) a $K$-independent scheme that depends only on the current episode index. For both settings, we obtain an upper bound on $\Pr(R_K \ge x)$ that exhibits a distinctive two-regime structure: a sub-Gaussian tail starting from an instance-dependent scale $m_K$ up to a transition threshold, followed by a sub-Weibull tail beyond that point. We further derive corresponding instance-dependent bounds on the expected regret $\mathbb{E}[R_K]$. The proposed algorithm depends on a tuning parameter $\alpha$, which balances the expected regret and the range over which the regret exhibits a sub-Gaussian tail. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide one of the first comprehensive tail-regret guarantees for a standard optimistic algorithm in episodic reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>A Fair OR-ML Framework for Resource Substitution in Large-Scale Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring that the right resource is available at the right location and time remains a major challenge for organizations operating large-scale logistics networks. The challenge comes from uneven demand patterns and the resulting asymmetric flow of resources across the arcs, which create persistent imbalances at the network nodes. Resource substitution among multiple, potentially composite and interchangeable, resource types is a cost-effective way to mitigate these imbalances. This leads to the resource substitution problem, which aims at determining the minimum number of resource substitutions from an initial assignment to minimize the overall network imbalance. In decentralized settings, achieving globally coordinated solutions becomes even more difficult. When substitution entails costs, effective prescriptions must also incorporate fairness and account for the individual preferences of schedulers. This paper presents a generic framework that combines operations research (OR) and machine learning (ML) to enable fair resource substitution in large networks. The OR component models and solves the resource substitution problem under a fairness lens. The ML component leverages historical data to learn schedulers' preferences, guide intelligent exploration of the decision space, and enhance computational efficiency by dynamically selecting the top-$\kappa$ resources for each arc in the network. The framework produces a portfolio of high-quality solutions from which schedulers can select satisfactory trade-offs. The proposed framework is applied to the network of one of the largest package delivery companies in the world, which serves as the primary motivation for this research. Computational results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including an 80% reduction in model size and a 90% decrease in execution time while preserving optimality.</description>

      <title>Aspiration-based Perturbed Learning Automata in Games with Noisy Utility Measurements. Part B: Stochastic Stability in Weakly Acyclic Games</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement-based learning dynamics may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In (repeatedly-played) multi-player/action strategic-form games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. Furthermore, strong convergence guarantees (i.e., almost sure convergence or weak convergence) are mostly restricted to two-player games. To address this main limitation of reinforcement-based learning in repeatedly-played strategic-form games, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization in multi-player/action strategic-form games. We present an extension of perturbed learning automata (PLA), namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA), in which each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This paper is the second part of this study that analyzes stochastic stability in multi-player/action weakly-acyclic games in the presence of noisy observations. We provide conditions under which convergence is attained (in weak sense) to the set of pure Nash equilibria and payoff-dominant equilibria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reinforcement-based learning scheme that addresses convergence in weakly-acyclic games. Lastly, we provide a specialization of the results to the classical Stag-Hunt game, supported by a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Robust Differential Evolution via Nonlinear Population Size Reduction and Adaptive Restart: The ARRDE Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is motivated by a robustness issue in numerical optimization of bound-constrained problems: many algorithms that perform well on a particular benchmark suite, such as the IEEE CEC2017 problems, struggle to maintain the same level of performance when applied to other suites that differ in dimensionality, landscape complexity, or the maximum number of function evaluations ($N_{\text{max}}$). To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism.
  We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered. These results highlight ARRDE's robustness and its superior generalization capability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven pipeline developed in collaboration with the Power Packs Project, a nonprofit addressing food insecurity in local communities. The system integrates data extraction from PDFs, large language models for ingredient standardization, and binary integer programming to generate a 15-week recipe schedule that minimizes projected wholesale costs while meeting nutritional constraints. All 157 recipes were mapped to a nutritional database and assigned estimated and predicted costs using historical invoice data and category-specific inflation adjustments. The model effectively handles real-world price volatility and is structured for easy updates as new recipes or cost data become available. Optimization results show that constraint-based selection yields nutritionally balanced and cost-efficient plans under uncertainty. To facilitate real-time decision-making, we deployed a searchable web platform that integrates analytical models into daily operations by enabling staff to explore recipes by ingredient, category, or through an optimized meal plan.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity and L2 Stability of Large-Scale Networks with Changing Interconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the L2 stability of switched networks is studied based on the QSR-dissipativity of each agent. While the integration of dissipativity with switched systems has received considerable attention, most previous studies have focused on passivity, internal stability, or feedback networks involving only two agents. This work makes two contributions: first, the relationship between switched QSR-dissipativity and L2 stability is established based on the properties of dissipativity parameters of switched systems; and second, conditions for L2 stability of networks consisting of QSR-dissipative agents with switching interconnection topologies are derived. Crucially, this shows that a common storage function will exist across all modes, avoiding the need to find one, which becomes computationally taxing for large networks with many possible configurations. Numerical examples demonstrate how this can facilitate stability analysis for networked systems under arbitrary switching of swarm drones.</description>

      <title>N2N: A Parallel Framework for Large-Scale MILP under Distributed Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&amp;B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.</description>

      <title>Joint learning of a network of linear dynamical systems via total variation penalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint estimation of the parameters of $m$ linear dynamical systems, given access to single realizations of their respective trajectories, each of length $T$. The linear systems are assumed to reside on the nodes of an undirected and connected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$, and the system matrices are assumed to either vary smoothly or exhibit small number of ``jumps'' across the edges. We consider a total variation penalized least-squares estimator and derive non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error (MSE) which hold with high probability. In particular, the bounds imply for certain choices of well connected $G$ that the MSE goes to zero as $m$ increases, even when $T$ is constant. The theoretical results are supported by extensive experiments on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for the Ultimate Independence Ratio of Odd Wheels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultimate independence ratio of a graph $G$ is defined as $\mathscr{I}(G) = \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty } \frac{\alpha(G^{\Box k})}{|V(G)|^k},$ where $\alpha(G^{\Box k})$ is the independence number of the Cartesian product of $k$ copies of $G$. For all graphs $G$, Hahn, Hell, and Poljak (1995) proved that $\frac{1}{\chi(G)} \leq \mathscr{I}(G) \leq \frac{1}{\omega(G)}$ where $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number, and $\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. So all graphs $G$ with $\chi(G) = \omega(G)$ satisfy $\mathscr{I}(G) = \frac{1}{\chi(G)} = \frac{1}{\omega(G)}$. A construction of Zhu demonstrates that there exists a graph $G$ with $\frac{1}{\chi(G)} &lt; \mathscr{I}(G) &lt; \frac{1}{\omega(G)}$, so neither equality holds in general. In response, Hahn, Hell, and Poljak conjectured that all wheel graphs $W_n$ satisfy $\mathscr{I}(W_n) = \frac{1}{\chi(W_n)}$.
  For even wheels $W_{2t}$ this follows from the fact $\chi(W_{2t}) = \omega(W_{2t}) = 3$. Odd wheels of length at least $5$ present a more challenging case, since $\chi(W_{2t+1}) = 4$ and $\omega(W_{2t+1}) = 3$. First, we prove that odd wheels of length at least $7$ satisfy $\mathscr{I}(W_{2t+1})\leq \frac{4t^2+6t}{3(2t+2)^2}&lt;\frac{1}{3}$, which provides the best upper bound for large odd wheels. Next, we prove that $\mathscr{I}(W_5) \leq \frac{1019}{3888}$, improving an upper bound of Hahn, Hell, and Poljak that $\mathscr{I}(W_5) \leq \frac{11}{41}$. Our proofs combine counting arguments, recursive bounds on $\alpha(W^{\Box k}_{2t+1})$, and computer-assisted calculation in the $W_5$ case.</description>

      <title>The local Turnpike Property in Mean Field Control and Games with quadratic Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local stability properties of solutions to ergodic and discounted mean field games systems in the long time horizon, around stationary equilibria, when the Hamiltonian is quadratic. We replace the usual monotonicity of the coupling term with a weaker, local assumption on the stationary equilibrium (that need not be unique), stemming from a second-order strict positivity condition. This new stability assumption, together with a symmetry property of the system, allows us to derive an exponential turnpike property for those solutions that are close to the stationary one. Finally, through a fixed-point argument, we establish the actual existence of stable solutions, both on the finite horizon $[0,T]$ and on the infinite horizon, provided that the initial (and terminal) data are close enough to the stationary equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Assisted Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure with Real-World Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.</description>

      <title>PolyOCP.jl -- A Julia Package for Stochastic OCPs and MPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The consideration of stochastic uncertainty in optimal and predictive control is a well-explored topic. Recently Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) have seen a lot of considerations for problems involving stochastically uncertain system parameters and also for problems with additive stochastic i.i.d. disturbances. While there exist a number of open-source PCE toolboxes, tailored open-source codes for the solution of OCPs involving additive stochastic i.i.d. disturbances in julia are not available. Hence, this paper introduces the toolbox PolyOCP.jl which enables to efficiently solve stochastic OCPs for a large class of disturbance distributions. We explain the main mathematical concepts between the PCE transcription of stochastic OCPs and how they are provided in the toolbox. We draw upon two examples to illustrate the functionalities of PolyOCP.jl.</description>

      <title>A modified Consensus-Based Optimization model: consensus formation and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a modified Consensus-Based Optimization model that admits a fully unified and rigorous analysis of its finite-particle dynamics, the associated McKean--Vlasov equation, and their optimization behavior under a single set of structural framework. The key ingredient is a regularized Gibbs weight that stabilizes the consensus point and avoids degeneracies present in the classical formulation, eliminating the need for cutoffs, rescaling, or boundedness assumptions on the objective function. Our first main result establishes large-time consensus for the particle system: when the drift exceeds an explicit threshold, all particles converge exponentially to a common random limit that concentrates near the global minimizer. Our second result proves uniform-in-time propagation of chaos, providing quantitative and dimension-free convergence of the empirical measure to the McKean--Vlasov dynamics. Finally, we show that the mean-field system reaches deterministic consensus and that its consensus point approaches the global minimizer in the regime of highly concentrated Gibbs weights. Together, these results yield a unified and internally consistent theoretical framework for consensus-based optimization under substantially relaxed regularity assumptions on the objective function.</description>

      <title>Fast and Flexible Flow Decompositions in General Graphs via Dominators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-assembly methods rely at their core on a flow decomposition problem, namely, decomposing a weighted graph into weighted paths or walks. However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations.
  Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products.
  We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications.</description>

      <title>Duality Perspective on Nonlinear Eigenproblems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear eigenproblems for a broad class of proper, closed, convex functionals in reflexive Banach spaces. We develop a dual formulation of the nonlinear eigenproblem using the Fenchel conjugate and establish an equivalence to the primal problem. Further, we introduce a duality gap and a geometric characterization of eigenvectors that apply in general Banach spaces. We interpret the dual problem as the eigenproblem for the inverse operator of the primal problem. Concerning numerical methods for solving nonlinear eigenproblems, we analyze the inverse power method, framed as a dual power method, showing strong convergence in the case of absolutely p-homogeneous functionals. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive numerical experiments for the p-Laplacian. We further connect the flow-based proximal power method from the literature to the inverse power method and discuss two numerical approaches to approximate higher-order nonlinear eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Design of Accelerated Composite Optimization Methods: OptISTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15704v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accelerated composite optimization method FISTA (Beck, Teboulle 2009) is suboptimal by a constant factor, and we present a new method OptISTA that improves FISTA by a constant factor of 2. The performance estimation problem (PEP) has recently been introduced as a new computer-assisted paradigm for designing optimal first-order methods. In this work, we present a double-function stepsize-optimization PEP methodology that poses the optimization over fixed-step first-order methods for composite optimization as a finite-dimensional nonconvex QCQP, which can be practically solved through spatial branch-and-bound algorithms, and use it to design the exact optimal method OptISTA for the composite optimization setup. We then establish the exact optimality of OptISTA under the large-scale assumption with a lower-bound construction that extends the semi-interpolated zero-chain construction (Drori, Taylor 2022) to the double-function setup of composite optimization. By establishing exact optimality, our work concludes the search for the fastest first-order methods, with respect to the performance measure of worst-case function value suboptimality, for the proximal, projected-gradient, and proximal-gradient setups involving a smooth convex function and a closed proper convex function.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Non-Strongly-Monotone Stochastic Quasi-Variational Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Variational Inequality (VI) is a well-established mathematical framework that subsumes Nash equilibrium and saddle-point problems, less is known about its extension, Quasi-Variational Inequalities (QVI). QVI allows for cases where the constraint set changes as the decision variable varies allowing for a more versatile setting. In this paper, we propose extra-gradient and gradient-based methods for solving a class of monotone Stochastic Quasi-Variational Inequalities (SQVI) and establish a rigorous convergence rate analysis for these methods. Our approach not only advances the theoretical understanding of SQVI but also demonstrates its practical applicability. Specifically, we highlight its effectiveness in reformulating and solving problems such as generalized Nash Equilibrium, bilevel optimization, and saddle-point problems with coupling constraints.</description>

      <title>PhiBE: A PDE-based Bellman Equation for Continuous Time Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study policy evaluation in continuous-time reinforcement learning, where the state follows an unknown stochastic differential equation (SDE) but only discrete-time data are available. We first highlight that the discrete-time Bellman equation (BE) is not always a reliable approximation to the true value function because it ignores the underlying continuous-time structure. We then introduce a new bellman equation, PhiBE, which integrates the discrete-time information into a continuous-time PDE formulation. By leveraging the smooth SDE structure of the underlying dynamics, PhiBE provides a provably more accurate approximation to the true value function, especially in scenarios where the underlying dynamics change slowly or the reward oscillates. Moreover, we extend PhiBE to higher orders, providing increasingly accurate approximations. We further develop a model-free algorithm for PhiBE under linear function approximation and establish its convergence under model misspecification. In contrast to existing RL analyses that diverges as the sampling interval shrinks, the approximation error of PhiBE remains remains well-conditioned and independent of the discretization step by exploiting the smoothness of the underlying dynamics. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical guarantees we propose.</description>

      <title>Consensus Planning with Primal, Dual, and Proximal Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consensus planning is a method for coordinating decision making across complex systems and organizations, including complex supply chain optimization pipelines. It arises when large interdependent distributed agents (systems) share common resources and must act in order to achieve a joint goal. In prior consensus planning work, all agents have been assumed to have the same interaction pattern (e.g., all dual agents or all primal agents or all proximal agents), most commonly using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) as proximal agents. However, this is often not a valid assumption in practice, where agents consist of large complex systems, and where we might not have the luxury of modifying these large complex systems at will. In this paper, we introduce a consensus algorithm that overcomes this hurdle by allowing for the coordination of agents with different types of interfaces (named primal, dual, and proximal). Our consensus planning algorithm allows for any mix of agents by combining ADMM-like updates for the proximal agents, dual ascent updates for the dual agents, and linearized ADMM updates for the primal agents. We prove convergence results for the algorithm, namely a sublinear O(1/k) convergence rate under mild assumptions, and two-step linear convergence under stronger assumptions. We also discuss enhancements to the basic method and provide illustrative empirical results.</description>

      <title>The inexact power augmented Lagrangian method for constrained nonconvex optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces an unconventional inexact augmented Lagrangian method where the augmenting term is a Euclidean norm raised to a power between one and two. The proposed algorithm is applicable to a broad class of constrained nonconvex minimization problems that involve nonlinear equality constraints. In a first part of this work, we conduct a full complexity analysis of the method under a mild regularity condition, leveraging an accelerated first-order algorithm for solving the H\"older-smooth subproblems. Interestingly, this worst-case result indicates that using lower powers for the augmenting term leads to faster constraint satisfaction, albeit with a slower decrease of the dual residual. Notably, our analysis does not assume boundedness of the iterates. Thereafter, we present an inexact proximal point method for solving the weakly-convex and H\"older-smooth subproblems, and demonstrate that the combined scheme attains an improved rate that reduces to the best-known convergence rate whenever the augmenting term is a classical squared Euclidean norm. Different augmenting terms, involving a lower power, further improve the primal complexity at the cost of the dual complexity. Finally, numerical experiments validate the practical performance of unconventional augmenting terms.</description>

      <title>On Representing Convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs via Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13805v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) involve finding a solution within a convex feasible region defined by quadratic constraints while minimizing a convex quadratic objective function. These problems arise in various industrial applications, including power systems and signal processing. Traditional methods for solving convex QCQPs primarily rely on matrix factorization, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the problem size increases. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their potential in representing and solving various optimization problems such as linear programs and linearly constrained quadratic programs. In this work, we investigate the representation power of GNNs in the context of QCQP tasks. Specifically, we propose a new tripartite graph representation for general convex QCQPs and properly associate it with message-passing GNNs. We demonstrate that there exist GNNs capable of reliably representing key properties of convex QCQPs, including feasibility, optimal value, and optimal solution. Our result deepens the understanding of the connection between QCQPs and GNNs, paving the way for future machine learning approaches to efficiently solve QCQPs.</description>

      <title>Ergodic control of McKean-Vlasov systems on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem with ergodic (long term average) reward for a McKean-Vlasov dynamics, where the coefficients of a controlled stochastic differential equation depend on the marginal law of the solution. Starting from the associated infinite time horizon expected discounted reward, we construct both the value $\lambda$ of the ergodic problem and an associated function $\phi$, which provide a viscosity solution to an ergodic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation of elliptic type. In contrast to previous results, we consider the function $\phi$ and the HJB equation on the Wasserstein space, using concepts of derivatives with respect to probability measures. The pair $(\lambda,\phi)$ also provides information on limit behavior of related optimization problems, for instance, results of Abelian-Tauberian type or limits of value functions of control problems for finite time horizon when the latter tends to infinity. Many arguments are simplified by the use of a functional relation for $\phi$ in the form of a suitable dynamic programming principle.</description>

      <title>Conditional Gradient Methods with Standard LMO for Stochastic Simple Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose efficient methods for solving stochastic simple bilevel optimization problems with convex inner levels, where the goal is to minimize an outer stochastic objective function subject to the solution set of an inner stochastic optimization problem. Existing methods often rely on costly projection or linear optimization oracles over complex sets, limiting their scalability. To overcome this, we propose an iteratively regularized conditional gradient approach that leverages linear optimization oracles exclusively over the base feasible set. Our proposed methods employ a vanishing regularization sequence that progressively emphasizes the inner problem while biasing towards desirable minimal outer objective solutions. In the one-sample stochastic setting and under standard convexity assumptions, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates of $O(t^{-1/4})$ for both the outer and inner objectives. In the finite-sum setting with a mini-batch scheme, the corresponding rates become $O(t^{-1/2})$. When the outer objective is nonconvex, we prove non-asymptotic convergence rates of $O(t^{-1/7})$ for both the outer and inner objectives in the one-sample stochastic setting, and $O(t^{-1/4})$ in the finite-sum setting. Experimental results on over-parametrized regression and dictionary learning tasks demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach over existing methods, confirming our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Decentralized Stochastic Gradient-Tracking with Finite-Time Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithms for decentralized optimization and learning rely on local optimization steps coupled with combination steps over a graph. Recent works have demonstrated that using a time-varying sequence of matrices that achieves finite-time consensus can improve the communication and iteration complexity of decentralized optimization algorithms based on gradient tracking. In practice, a sequence of matrices satisfying the exact finite-time consensus property may not be available due to imperfect knowledge of the network topology, a limit on the length of the sequence, or numerical instabilities. In this work, we quantify the impact of approximate finite-time consensus sequences on the convergence of a gradient-tracking based decentralized optimization algorithm. Our results hold for any periodic sequence of combination matrices. We clarify the interplay between approximation error of the finite-time consensus sequence and the length of the sequence as well as typical problem parameters such as smoothness and gradient noise.</description>

      <title>The LQR-Schr{\"o}dinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem in discrete time, where the pathwise cost is replaced by a sum of quadratic functions, taking the form of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost. This cost comprises potential terms that act as attractors and kinetic terms that control the diffusion of the process. When the two boundary marginals are Gaussian, we show that the LQR-Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem can be solved in closed form. We follow the dynamic programming principle, interpreting the Kantorovich potentials as cost-to-go functions. Under the LQR-Gaussian assumption, these potentials can be propagated exactly in a backward and forward passes, leading to a system of dual Riccati equations, well known in estimation and control. This system converges rapidly in practice. We then show that the optimal process is Markovian and compute its transition kernel in closed form as well as the Gaussian marginals. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to construct complex, non-homogeneous Gaussian processes with acceleration and loops, given well-chosen attractive potentials. Moreover, this approach allows extending the Bures transport between Gaussian distributions to more complex geometries with negative curvature.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective Accelerated Gradient-like Flow with Asymptotic Vanishing Normalized Gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the dynamical system proposed by Wang et al. [Siam. J. Sci. Comput., 2021] to multiobjective optimization by investigating a multiobjective accelerated gradient-like flow with asymptotically vanishing normalized gradient. Using Lyapunov analysis, we obtain convergence rates of $O(1/t^2)$ and $O(\ln^2 t / t^2)$ for the trajectory solution under two distinct parameter selections. Under certain assumptions, we further prove that the trajectory solution of this gradient flow converges to a weak Pareto solution for convex multiobjective optimization problems. Through corresponding discretization, we derive a new class of multiobjective gradient methods achieving a convergence rate of $O(\ln^2 k / k^2)$. Additionally, numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, demonstrating that this gradient flow outperforms other existing dynamical systems in the literature regarding convergence speed, and our algorithm exhibits corresponding advantages.</description>

      <title>Periodic Fractional Control in Bioprocesses for Clean Water and Ecosystem Health</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel fractional-order chemostat model (FOCM) incorporating Caputo fractional derivative with sliding memory (CFDS) to capture microbial memory effects in biological water treatment, addressing limitations of integer-order models that overlook time-dependent behaviors and fail to capture microbial memory such as delayed growth responses to past nutrient availability, history-dependent adaptation to inflow fluctuations, and persistent historical effects over hours to days, which are biologically critical in wastewater treatment. By optimizing periodic dilution rate control, we minimize the average pollutant output, constrained by treatment capacity and periodic boundaries. Key contributions include: (1) a rigorous fractional framework linking microbial kinetics to memory-driven control; (2) reduction to a 1D fractional-order differential equation (FDE) for computational efficiency; (3) proofs of optimal periodic solution (OPS) existence/uniqueness via Schauder's theorem and convexity; (4) bang-bang control derivation using fractional Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP) and Fourier-Gegenbauer pseudospectral (FG-PS) method with a specialized edge-detection technique to handle control discontinuities, ensuring efficient numerical resolution of switching points and discontinuities inherent in bang-bang strategies; and (5) a comprehensive sensitivity analysis revealing how the fractional order {\alpha}, scaling parameter {\vartheta}, and memory length L critically influence system performance, with simulations showing up to 40% reduction in substrate concentrations versus steady-state and demonstrating computational tractability through efficient discretization that scales favorably for practical implementation. Scientifically, this advances fractional calculus in bioprocesses, revealing memory's role in improving responsiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, GPU-accelerated optimization solvers based on second-order methods (e.g., interior-point methods) have gained momentum with the advent of mature and efficient GPU-accelerated direct sparse linear solvers, such as cuDSS. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art in GPU-based second-order solvers, focusing on pivoting-free interior-point methods for large and sparse linear and nonlinear programs. We begin by highlighting the capabilities and limitations of the currently available GPU-accelerated sparse linear solvers. Next, we discuss different formulations of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker systems for second-order methods and evaluate their suitability for pivoting-free GPU implementations. We also discuss strategies for computing sparse Jacobians and Hessians on GPUs for nonlinear programming. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating the scalability of GPU-based optimization solvers. We observe speedups often exceeding 10x compared to comparable CPU implementations on large-scale instances when solved up to medium precision. Additionally, we examine the current limitations of existing approaches.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we obtain several new complete characterizations of pseudolinear functions. Two of the results are of first-order and one is derivative free. All results are derived in terms of the Clarke-Rockafellar subdifferential. Additionally, we prove a characterization of the semi-strictly quasilinear functions. It is similar to the derivative free characterization of the pseudolinear functions. We also find the conditions such that a semi-strictly quasilinear function become pseudolinear.</description>

      <title>Qualification-free convex analysis via the joint supporting subspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In convex analysis, qualification conditions (also termed constraint qualifications) help avoid pathological behavior at domain boundaries. In this work we remove the need for such conditions by localizing to an affine subspace -- the joint supporting subspace -- that contains the feasible region and ensures qualification conditions hold after localization.
  Our theory generalizes Borwein and Wolkowicz's facial reduction beyond conic programs to convex programs of the form $f(x) + g(Ax)$. Intuitively, the joint supporting subspace corresponds to a bilateral facial reduction between any two convex sets. It enables simple qualification-free generalizations for a host of central results of convex analysis. These include: an exact Fenchel-Rockafellar dual; Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions; attained infimal convolution for convex conjugates; subdifferential sum and chain rules; and a characterization of the normal cones of the intersection of two convex sets. All generalizations reduce seamlessly to their original formulations when qualification conditions hold.
  We offer a number of characterizations for the joint supporting subspace, one of which is constructive. Our proofs are self-contained, and introduce a novel theoretical framework consisting of nested normals and supporting subspaces, which simultaneously describe both the boundary of convex sets and the lattice of faces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a powerful tool in mathematics and data science but faces severe computational and statistical challenges in high dimensions. We propose convex relaxation approaches based on marginal and cluster moment relaxations that exploit locality and correlative sparsity in the distributions. These methods approximate high-dimensional couplings using low-order marginals and sparse moment statistics, yielding semidefinite programs that provide lower bounds on the OT cost with greatly reduced complexity. For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases. In addition, we demonstrate how to extract transport maps from our relaxations, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling. Our results suggest that convex relaxations can provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional OT.</description>

Abstract: We propose several new nonsmooth Newton methods for solving convex composite optimization problems with polyhedral regularizers, while avoiding the computation of complicated second-order information on these functions. Under the tilt-stability condition at the optimal solution, these methods achieve the quadratic convergence rates expected of Newton schemes. Numerical experiments on Lasso, generalized Lasso, OSCAR-regularized least-square problems, and an image super-resolution task illustrate both the broad applicability and the accelerated convergence profile of the proposed algorithms, in comparison with first-order and several recently developed nonsmooth Newton schemes.</description>

      <title>Globally Optimal Quantum Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05790v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are nonconvex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present quantum control via polynomial optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but also provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the convergence of their infinitesimal generators in the mixed topology, we provide a stability result for strongly continuous convex monotone semigroups on spaces of continuous functions. In contrast to previous results, we do not rely on the theory of viscosity solutions but use a recent comparison principle which uniquely determines the semigroup via its $\Gamma$-generator defined on the Lipschitz set and therefore resembles the classical analogue from the linear case. The framework also allows for discretizations both in time and space and covers a variety of applications. This includes Euler schemes and Yosida-type approximations for upper envelopes of families of linear semigroups, stability results and finite-difference schemes for convex HJB equations, Freidlin-Wentzell-type results and Markov chain approximations for a class of stochastic optimal control problems and continuous-time Markov processes with uncertain transition probabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimization of a smooth and strongly convex objective using constant step-size stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and study its properties through the prism of Markov chains. We show that, for unbiased gradient estimates with mildly controlled variance, the iteration converges to an invariant distribution in total variation distance. We also establish this convergence in Wasserstein-2 distance under a relaxed assumption on the gradient noise distribution compared to previous work. Our analysis shows that the SGD iterates and their invariant limit distribution \emph{inherit} sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential concentration properties when these hold true for the gradient. This allows the derivation of high-confidence bounds for the final estimate. Finally, under such conditions in the linear case, we obtain a dimension-free deviation bound for the Polyak-Ruppert average of a tail sequence. All our results are non-asymptotic and their consequences are discussed through a few applications.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Unification of Distributionally Robust Covariance Estimators: Shrinking the Spectrum by Inflating the Ambiguity Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art methods for estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices all shrink the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix towards a data-insensitive shrinkage target. The underlying shrinkage transformation is either chosen heuristically - without compelling theoretical justification - or optimally in view of restrictive distributional assumptions. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to construct covariance estimators without imposing restrictive assumptions. That is, we study distributionally robust covariance estimation problems that minimize the worst-case Frobenius error with respect to all data distributions close to a nominal distribution, where the proximity of distributions is measured via a divergence on the space of covariance matrices. We identify mild conditions on this divergence under which the resulting minimizers represent shrinkage estimators. We show that the corresponding shrinkage transformations are intimately related to the geometrical properties of the underlying divergence. We also prove that our robust estimators are efficiently computable and asymptotically consistent and that they enjoy finite-sample performance guarantees. We exemplify our general methodology by synthesizing explicit estimators induced by the Kullback-Leibler, Fisher-Rao, and Wasserstein divergences.

      <title>Quasi-Steady-State Approach for Efficient Multiscale Simulation and Optimization of mAb Glycosylation in CHO Cell Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glycosylation is a critical quality attribute for monoclonal antibody (mAb) production, influenced by both process conditions and cellular mechanisms. Multiscale mechanistic models, spanning from the bioreactor to the Golgi apparatus, have been proposed for analyzing the glycosylation process. However, these models are computationally intensive to solve when using traditional methods, making optimization and control challenging. In this work, we propose a quasi-steady-state (QSS) approach for efficiently solving the multiscale glycosylation model. By introducing the QSS assumption and assuming negligible nucleotide sugar donor (NSD) flux for glycosylation in the Golgi, the large-scale partial differential algebraic equation system is converted into a series of independent differential algebraic equation systems. Based on that representation, we develop a three-step QSS simulation method and further reduce computational time through parallel computing and nonuniform time grid strategies. Case studies in simulation, parameter estimation, and dynamic optimization demonstrate that the QSS approach can be more than 300-fold faster than the method of lines, with less than 1.6% relative errors. This work establishes a solid foundation for multiscale model-based optimization and control of the glycosylation process, supporting the implementation of quality by design.</description>

      <title>MeshCone: Second-Order Cone Programming for Geometrically-Constrained Mesh Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern geometric generation methods rely heavily on deep learning methods that, while powerful, often lack interpretability and require extensive training data. This work introduces MeshCone, a convex optimization framework for mesh enhancement from partially deformed meshes that requires no training data. We formulate the problem as a second-order cone program where vertex positions are optimized to align with target geometry while enforcing smoothness through convex edge-length regularization. Our convex relaxation enables deterministic, interpretable solutions with proven convergence properties via the Splitting Conic Solver (SCS). We demonstrate robust performance across 56 diverse object categories from ShapeNet and ThreeDScans, achieving superior refinement quality compared to classical baselines while maintaining sub-second inference times. This work establishes a principled baseline demonstrating what convex optimization alone can achieve, providing mathematical guarantees and interpretability that complement data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Local minimizers in $3$d of vector Allen-Cahn with a quadruple junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $\Omega$ a perturbation of the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we establish the existence of a sequence of local minimizers for the vector Allen-Cahn energy. The sequence converges in $L^1$ to a partition of $\Omega$ whose skeleton is given by a tetrahedral cone and thus contains a quadruple point. This is accomplished by proving that the partition is an isolated local minimizer of a weighted perimeter problem arising as the associated $\Gamma$-limit of the sequence of Allen-Cahn functionals.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Free Energy Principle for Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their groundbreaking performance, autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.</description>

      <title>Comparison for semi-continuous viscosity solutions for second order PDEs on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a comparison result for semi-continuous viscosity solutions of a class of second-order PDEs in the Wasserstein space. This allows us to remove the Lipschitz continuity assumption with respect to the Fourier-Wasserstein distance in AriX: 2309.05040 and obtain uniqueness by directly working in the Wasserstein space. In terms of its application, we characterize the value function of a stochastic control problem with partial observation as the unique viscosity solution to its corresponding HJB equation. Additionally, we present an application to a prediction problem under partial monitoring, where we establish an upper bound on the limit of regret using our comparison principle for degenerate dynamics.</description>

      <title>Situationally-Aware Dynamics Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots operating in complex, unstructured environments face significant challenges due to latent, unobserved factors that obscure their understanding of both their internal state and the external world. Addressing this challenge would enable robots to develop a more profound grasp of their operational context. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for online learning of hidden state representations, with which the robots can adapt in real-time to uncertain and dynamic conditions that would otherwise be ambiguous and result in suboptimal or erroneous behaviors. Our approach is formalized as a Generalized Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process, which explicitly models the influence of unobserved parameters on both transition dynamics and reward structures. Our core innovation lies in learning online the joint distribution of state transitions, which serves as an expressive representation of latent ego- and environmental-factors. This probabilistic approach supports the identification and adaptation to different operational situations, improving robustness and safety. Through a multivariate extension of Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection, our method segments changes in the underlying data generating process governing the robot's dynamics. The robot's transition model is then informed with a symbolic representation of the current situation derived from the joint distribution of latest state transitions, enabling adaptive and context-aware decision-making. To showcase the real-world effectiveness, we validate our approach in the challenging task of unstructured terrain navigation, where unmodeled and unmeasured terrain characteristics can significantly impact the robot's motion. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real world reveal significant improvements in data efficiency, policy performance, and the emergence of safer, adaptive navigation strategies.</description>

      <title>On the non-convexity issue in the radial Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical approach to the Calder\'on problem is to estimate the unknown conductivity by solving a nonlinear least-squares problem. It leads to a nonconvex optimization problem which is generally believed to be riddled with bad local minimums. We revisit this issue in the case of piecewise constant radial conductivities and prove that, contrary to previous claims, there are no spurious critical points in the case of two scalar unknowns with no measurement noise. We also provide a partial proof of this result in the general setting which holds under a numerically verifiable assumption. Finally, we investigate whether a recently proposed approach based on convexification yields better reconstructions. For the first time, we propose a way to implement it in practice and show that it is consistently outperformed by some least squares solvers, which are also faster and require less measurements.</description>

      <title>Canonical Frames for Bracket Generating Rank 2 Distributions which are not Goursat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09307v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We complete a uniform construction of canonical absolute parallelism for bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube on $n$-dimensional manifold with $n\geq 5$ by showing that the condition of maximality of class that was assumed previously by Doubrov-Zelenko for such a construction holds automatically at generic points. This also gives analogous constructions in the case when the cube is not $5$-dimensional but the distribution is not Goursat through the procedure of iterative Cartan deprolongation. This together with the classical theory of Goursat distributions covers in principle the local geometry of all bracket generating rank 2 distributions in a neighborhood of generic points. As a byproduct, for any $n\geq 5$ we describe the maximally symmetric germs among bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube, as well as among those which reduce to such a distribution under a fixed number of Cartan deprolongations. Another consequence of our results on maximality of class is for optimal control problems with constraint given by a rank $2$ distribution with $5$-dimensional cube: it implies that for a generic point $q_0$ of $M$, there are plenty abnormal extremal trajectories of corank $1$ (which is the minimal possible corank) starting at $q_0$. The set of such points contains all points where the distribution is equiregular.</description>

      <title>Bioluminescence tomography via a shape optimization method based on a complex-valued model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the inverse source problem arising in bioluminescence tomography, the objective of which is to reconstruct both the support and the intensity of an internal light source from boundary measurements governed by an elliptic model. A shape optimization framework is developed in which the source intensity and its support are decoupled through first-order optimality conditions. To enhance the stability of the reconstruction, we incorporate a parameter-dependent coupled complex boundary method together with perimeter and volume regularizations. Source support is represented by a level set function, allowing the algorithm to naturally accommodate topological changes and recover multiple, closely spaced, or nested source regions. Theoretical justifications for the proposed formulation and regularization strategy are established, and extensive numerical experiments are performed to assess the reconstruction accuracy for both noise-free and noisy data. The results demonstrate that our method achieves robust and accurate recovery of source geometry and intensity, and exhibits clear advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Investigating the consequences of mechanical ventilation in clinical intensive care settings through an evolutionary game-theoretic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems (so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using empirical and game-theoretic elements.</description>

      <title>Transforming Strategic Games into Biform Games: Applications in Allocation Mechanisms and Green Technology Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Aumann stated, cooperation and non-cooperation are different ways of viewing the same game, with the main difference being whether players can reach a binding cooperative agreement. In the real world, many games often coexist competition and cooperation. Based on the above reasons, we propose a method to transform strategic games into a biform game model, which retains the characteristics of cooperative games while considering the ultimate goal of players to maximize their own interests. Furthermore, based on this biform game model, we analyze the impact of two different distribution methods, namely marginalism and egalitarianism, on the game results. As an application, we analyze how food producers seek maximum profits through cooperative pricing.</description>
