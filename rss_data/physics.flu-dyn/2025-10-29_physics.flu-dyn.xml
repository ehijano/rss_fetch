      <title>Refinement of a Poroelastic Model for Zero Porosity: Finite Element Implementation and Investigation of Fluid Mechanics in the Perivascular Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional formulations of poroelasticity, when the porosity approaches zero or vanishes in some parts of the poroelastic domain, if only temporarily, the governing equations degenerate to those for the solid phase thereby inhibiting a suitable determination of the fluid velocity field. To address this challenge, we reformulated a poroelastic model based on mixture theory to accommodate scenarios with zero porosity. We verified our model using the method of manufactured solutions and demonstrated its ability to handle extreme conditions in a sample test problem. As an application of our framework, we investigated peristaltic flow in the perivascular space of a penetrating arteriole in brain. Our analysis revealed that some literature-suggested parameters can drive the model to predict extreme non-physiological conditions. We further demonstrated that these extreme conditions can be somewhat mitigated by accounting for the deformation of the surrounding brain tissue.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Contraction-Induced Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peristalsis is the driving mechanism behind a broad array of biological and engineered flows. In peristaltic pumping, a wave-like contraction of the tube wall produces local changes in volume which induce flow. Net flow arises due to geometric nonlinearities in the momentum equation, which must be properly captured to compute the flow accurately. While most previous models focus on radius-imposed peristalsis, they often neglect longitudinal length changes - a natural consequence of radial contraction in elastic materials. In this paper, to capture a more accurate picture of peristaltic pumping, we calculate the flow in an elastic vessel undergoing contractions in the transverse and longitudinal directions simultaneously, keeping the geometric nonlinearities arising in the strain. A careful analysis requires us to study our fluid using the Lagrangian coordinates of the elastic tube. We perform analytic calculations of the flow characteristics by studying the fluid inside a fixed boundary with time-dependent metric. This mathematical manipulation works even for large-amplitude contractions, as we confirm by comparing our analytical results to COMSOL simulations. We demonstrate that transverse and longitudinal contractions induce instantaneous flows at the same order in wall strain, but in opposite directions. We investigate the influence of the wall's Poisson ratio on the flow profile. Incompressible walls suppress flow by minimizing local volume changes, whereas auxetic walls enhance flow. For radius-imposed peristaltic waves, wall incompressibility reduces both reflux and particle trapping. In contrast, length-imposed waves typically generate backflow, although trapping can still occur at large amplitudes for some Poisson ratios. These results yield a more complete description of peristalsis in elastic media and offer a framework for studying contraction-induced flows more broadly.</description>

      <title>Local polynomial solutions of steady Euler equations for planar ideal fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the general analytical solutions to the Euler equations for ideal fluids holds significant theoretical and practical importance. The steady flows in two-dimensional spaces are considered whether there is an analytical solution in the form of finite polynomials defined in the local region. By employing the tensorial representation and the complex variable notation, we successfully work out the local analytical solutions in terms of polynomials with highest degree up to four, and the general form of solutions for higher-degree polynomials can also be anticipated. Several examples are illustrated and some discussion comments on the effect of the viscous term from the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations are presented.</description>

      <title>Assessment of modern shock capturing schemes for all-speed flows in the OpenFOAM framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenFOAM is a widely used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework based on the finite volume method for solving a wide range of flow problems. However, its default numerical schemes, particularly the Kurganov-Noelle-Petrova (KNP) method used for shock capturing, are only low-order accurate. This work presents the implementation of modern high-order Riemann solvers along with AUSM+up (Advection Upstream Splitting Method) and LDFSS (Low Diffusion Flux Splitting Scheme) within the OpenFOAM environment. It evaluates them across test cases of increasing complexity. Results show that the default KNP scheme is robust but overly diffusive on coarse grids, suppressing flow features, while finer grids introduce spurious oscillations. The solver remains stable only under low Courant numbers but can tolerate mild numerical noise at higher values (around 0.5). A Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta time integration enhances stability while preserving accuracy. Among the tested flux schemes, HLLC (Harten-Lax-van Leer Contact) and its corrected variants HLLC-LM (Low-Mach correction) and HLLCP (pressure dissipation), as well as AUSM+up and LDFSS, all improve shock and contact-wave resolution on coarse grids. While the standard HLLC suffers from grid-aligned discontinuities, the corrected forms overcome these issues. AUSM+up introduces slightly higher dissipation and underperforms in deep subsonic regimes. In contrast, LDFSS provides comparable accuracy to HLLC-type solvers but is computationally expensive at very low Mach numbers and fails for strong unsteady shocks. The findings guide OpenFOAM users in selecting suitable shock-capturing schemes for specific flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Overshoot-resolved transition modeling based on field inversion and symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overshoot of high-speed transitional skin-friction and heat-transfer values over their fully turbulent levels is well documented by numerous direct numerical simulations (DNS) and experimental studies. However, this high-speed-specific overshoot phenomenon remains a longstanding challenge in Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) transition models. In this paper, field inversion and symbolic regression (FISR) methodologies are adopted to explore a generalizable and interpretable augmentation for resolving the missing overshoot characteristic. Specifically, field inversion is implemented on our previous high-speed-improved $k$-$\omega$-$\gamma$-$\widetilde{Re}_{\theta \rm{t}}$ transition-turbulence model. Then symbolic regression is employed to derive an analytical map from RANS mean flow variables to the pre-defined and inferred corrective field $\beta(\mathbf{x})$. Results manifest that the excavated expression faithfully reproduces the overshoot phenomena of transition region over various test cases while does not corrupt model behavior in transition location and length. Based on its transparent functional form, mechanistic investigations are conducted to illustrate the underlying logic for accurate capture of overshoot phenomenon. In addition, importance of protect function in $\beta(\mathbf{x})$, feasibility of a more concise expression for $\beta(\mathbf{x})$, and reliable performance of $\beta(\mathbf{x})$ in low-speed transitional flows are emphasized.</description>

      <title>High-energy droplet collisions in multi-interacting hollow cone sprays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets collide in several complex spray environments ranging from sea sprays to combustion chambers, altering their size and velocity characteristics. The present work offers a systematic investigation of such collisions within the interacting region formed by three hollow-cone sprays, termed the combined spray, at two elevated liquid sheet Weber numbers (Wel). The integrated analysis employs Phase Doppler Interferometry (PDI) and microscopic high-speed backlight imaging to characterize the collision dynamics. PDI indicates a notable reduction (11-15%) in Sauter mean diameter (SMD) at the onset of the interaction region. Images reveal frequent and high-energy droplet collisions, capturing structures associated with binary collision outcomes, namely reflexive and stretching separations, splashing, fingering, and stretching with digitations, along with complex multi-droplet collisions. These collisions produce numerous smaller satellite droplets at the expense of larger parent droplets, leading to a decrease in local SMD. Increasing Wel elevates the frequency of these outcomes, particularly highlighting stretching separation as the dominant mechanism. Furthermore, joint probability density functions from PDI and image-based analysis confirm that most satellite droplets predominantly exhibit axial motion, in contrast to the initial trajectories of parent droplets. The satellite droplets continue to move downstream, colliding with others and resulting in a cascade effect that produces finer droplets. Rescaled droplet size distributions, normalized by mean droplet diameter, are broader in the combined spray due to enhanced size reduction from collisions. These distributions are well captured by the compound gamma distribution, reflecting ligament-mediated breakup dynamics.</description>

      <title>Characterisation and extension of a rigid body dynamics solver coupled with OpenFOAM for flight performance analysis of flapping-wing drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extraordinary aerial agility of hummingbirds and insects continues to inspire the design of flapping-wing drones. To replicate and analyze such flight, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that couple flow solvers with rigid body dynamics are essential. While OpenFOAM offers tools for these multiphysics simulations, two key limitations remain: (1) a lack of thorough verification and performance characterization, and (2) the reliance on torque-based control for wing motion, which is impractical for parametric studies and real-time control. The developments are tested with a four and a five degrees of freedom flapping-wing drone equipped with a rigid, semi-elliptical wing. Ascending flight motions are simulated using the overset method, a moving background grid, and an LES model. Parametric studies demonstrate the independence of the grid and integration schemes, while profiling analyses identify the overset method as the computational bottleneck. The drone trajectories are compared with those from a literature quasi-steady model, and the body-wing interaction is analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Scale Separation and Stochastic Closure for Data-Driven Prediction of Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24583v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating turbulent fluid flows is a computationally prohibitive task, as it requires the resolution of fine-scale structures and the capture of complex nonlinear interactions across multiple scales. This is particularly the case in direct numerical simulation (DNS) applied to real-world turbulent applications. Consequently, extensive research has focused on analysing turbulent flows from a data-driven perspective. However, due to the complex and chaotic nature of these systems, traditional models often become unstable as they accumulate errors through autoregression, severely degrading even short-term predictions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a purely stochastic approach that separately addresses the evolution of large-scale coherent structures and the closure of high-fidelity statistical data. To this end, the dynamics of the filtered data (i.e. coherent motion) are learnt using an autoregressive model. This combines a VAE and Transformer architecture. The VAE projection is probabilistic, ensuring consistency between the model's stochasticity and the flow's statistical properties. To recover high-fidelity velocity fields from the filtered latent space, Gaussian Process (GP) regression is employed. This strategy has been tested in the context of a Kolmogorov flow exhibiting chaotic behaviour analogous to real-world turbulence. We compare the performance of our model with state-of-the-art probabilistic baselines, including a VAE and a diffusion model. We demonstrate that our Gaussian process-based closure outperforms these baselines in capturing first and second moment statistics in this particular test bed, providing robust and adaptive confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Learning constitutive models and rheology from partial flow measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constitutive laws are at the core of fluid mechanics, relating the fluid stress to its deformation rate. Unlike Newtonian fluids, most industrial and biological fluids are non-Newtonian, exhibiting a nonlinear relation. Accurately characterizing this nonlinearity is essential for predicting flow behavior in real-world engineering and translational applications. Yet current methods fall short by relying on bulk rheometer data and simple fits that fail to capture behaviors relevant in complex geometries and flow conditions. Data-driven approaches can capture more complex behaviors, but lack interpretability or consistency. To close this gap, we leverage automatic differentiation to build an end-to-end framework for robust rheological learning. We develop a differentiable non-Newtonian fluid solver with a tensor basis neural network closure that learns stress directly from arbitrary flow measurements, such as velocimetry data. In parallel, we implement differentiable versions of major constitutive relations, enabling Bayesian model parametrization and selection from rheometer data. Our framework predicts flows in unseen geometries and ensures physical consistency and interpretability by matching neural network responses to known constitutive laws. Ultimately, this work lays the groundwork for advanced digital rheometry capable of comprehensively characterizing non-Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids under realistic in-situ or in-line operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Global sonde datasets do not support a mesoscale transition in the turbulent energy cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conceptual and theoretical models describing the dynamics of the atmosphere often assume a hierarchy of dynamic regimes, each operating over some limited range of spatial scales. The largest scales are presumed to be governed by quasi-two-dimensional geostrophic turbulence, mesoscale dynamics by gravity waves, and the smallest scales by 3D isotropic turbulence. In theory, this hierarchy should be observable as clear scale breaks in turbulent kinetic energy spectra as one physical mechanism transitions to the next. Here, we show that this view is not supported by global dropsonde and radiosonde datasets of horizontal winds. Instead, the structure function for horizontal wind calculated for vertical separations between 200 m and 8 km has a Hurst exponent of $H_v \approx 0.6$, which is inconsistent with either gravity waves ($H_v = 1$) or 3D turbulence ($H_v = 1/3$). For horizontal separations between 200 km and 1800 km, the Hurst exponent is $H_h \approx 0.4$, which is inconsistent with quasi-geostrophic dynamics ($H_h = 1$). We argue that sonde observations are most consistent with a lesser known "Lovejoy-Schertzer" model for stratified turbulence where, at all scales, the dynamics of the atmosphere obey a single anisotropic turbulent cascade with $H_v=3/5$ and $H_h =1/3$. While separation scales smaller than 200 m are not explored here due to measurement limitations, the analysis nonetheless supports a single cohesive theoretical framework for describing atmospheric dynamics, one that might substitute for the more traditional hierarchy of mechanisms that depends on spatial scale.</description>

      <title>A data free neural operator enabling fast inference of 2D and 3D Navier Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning, this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Neural Interpolation of a Sequence of Wind Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid and accurate urban wind field prediction is essential for modeling particle transport in emergency scenarios. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approaches are too slow for real-time applications, necessitating surrogate models. We develop a hybrid neural interpolation method for constructing surrogate models that can update urban wind maps on timescales aligned with meteorological variations.
  Our approach combines Tucker tensor decomposition with neural networks to interpolate Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions across varying inlet wind angles. The method decomposes high-dimensional velocity, pressure, and eddy viscosity field datasets into a core tensor and factor matrices, then uses Fourier interpolation for angular modes and k-nearest neighbors convolution for spatial interpolation. A neural network correction mitigates interpolation artifacts while preserving physical consistency.
  We validate the approach on a simple cylinder-sphere configuration and, relative to a strong pure neural network benchmark, achieve comparable or improved accuracy ($R^2 &gt; 0.99$) with significantly reduced training time. The pure NN remains a feasible reference model; the hybrid provides an accelerated approximate alternative that suppresses spurious oscillations, maintains wake dynamics, and demonstrates computational efficiency suitable for real-time urban wind simulation.</description>

      <title>EddyFormer: Accelerated Neural Simulations of Three-Dimensional Turbulence at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM) architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features. We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows, EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review inadequacy of existing nematodynamic theories and suggest a novel way of establishing relations between nematic orientation and flow based on the \emph{local} symmetry between simultaneous rotation of nematic alignment and flow, which establishes energy exchange between the the two without reducing the problem to near-equilibrium conditions and invoking Onsager's relations. This approach, applied in the framework of the vector-based theory with a variable modulus, involves antisymmetric interactions between nematic alignment and flow and avoids spurious instabilities in the absence of an active inputs.</description>

      <title>Motile Bacteria-laden Droplets Exhibit Reduced Adhesion and Anomalous Wetting Behavior</title>

Abstract: Hypothesis: Bacterial contamination of surfaces poses a major threat to public health. Designing effective antibacterial or self-cleaning surfaces requires understanding how bacteria-laden droplets interact with solid substrates and how readily they can be removed. We hypothesize that bacterial motility critically influences the early-stage surface interaction (i.e., surface adhesion) of bacteria-laden droplets, which cannot be captured by conventional contact angle goniometry. Experiments: Sessile droplets containing live and dead Escherichia coli (E. coli) were studied to probe their wetting and interfacial behavior. Contact angle goniometry was used to probe dynamic wetting, while a cantilever-deflection-based method was used to quantify adhesion. Internal flow dynamics were visualized using micro-particle image velocimetry (PIV) and analyzed statistically. Complementary sliding experiments on moderately wettable substrates were performed to assess contact line mobility under tilt. Findings: Despite lower surface tension, droplets containing live bacteria exhibited lower surface adhesion forces than their dead counterparts, with adhesion further decreasing at higher bacterial concentrations. Micro-PIV revealed that flagellated live E. coli actively resist evaporation-driven capillary flow via upstream migration, while at higher concentrations, collective dynamics emerge, producing spatially coherent bacterial motion despite temporal variability. These coordinated flows disrupt passive transport and promote depinning of the contact line, thereby reducing adhesion. Sliding experiments confirmed enhanced contact line mobility and frequent stick-slip motion in live droplets, even with lower receding contact angles and higher hysteresis. These findings provide mechanistic insight into droplet retention, informing the design of self-cleaning/antifouling surfaces.</description>

      <title>Faraday Wave Singularities Trigger Microbubble Jetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20755</link>

Abstract: Wall-attached bubbles can produce repeated jets under gentle ultrasound stimulation through the Faraday instability. We identify three distinct jetting regimes defined by the jetting frequency and the bubble surface topology. We demonstrate that these jets form via flow-focusing singularities following two distinct collapse modes of the bubble interface: conical, producing a jet towards the substrate, or parabolic, generating a pair of oppositely directed jets. Scaling laws governing these collapse events are derived, revealing a universal self-similar structure governed by inertia and capillarity. Furthermore, we establish the dependence of the interface acceleration for jetting on driving frequency and characterise the jet speed as a function of Faraday wave height and bubble size. These findings may inform the design of low-power biofilm removal ultrasound systems and contribute to improved safety in targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of emergent large-scale dynamics in forced stratified shear flows</title>

Abstract: Although stably stratified shear flows, where the base velocity shear is quasi-continuously forced externally, arise in many geophysically and environmentally relevant circumstances, the emergent dynamics of their ensuing statistically steady stratified turbulence is still an open question. We address this phenomenon in a series of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations using spectral element methods. We consider a forced, stably stratified shear flow with an initial bulk Reynolds number $\ReO = 50$, an initial bulk Richardson number $\RiO = 1/80$ (also corresponding to the initial minimum gradient Richardson number $\Rig$), and a fluid of Prandtl number $\Pr = 1$ in horizontally extended domains. Although the initial configuration is unstable to a primary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, the ensuing turbulence is sustained by continuously relaxing the resulting flow back towards the initial profiles of streamwise velocity and buoyancy. We study statistical as well as structural aspects of the final statistically steady flows, including the flux coefficient $\Gchi$ and dynamically emergent length scales $\Lambda$ associated with the large-scale dynamics, respectively. Despite the ongoing stirring and mixing, we find that the shear layer half-depth converges to a finite value of $d \approx 8$ (i.e., $\Lambda_{z} \approx 16$) once the horizontal extent of the domain $\Gh \gtrsim 96$. While this implies a final $\Re \approx 400$ and $\Ri \approx 0.1$, we hypothesise that such forced flows \enquote{tune} themselves eventually to a state of a gradient Richardson number $\Rig \lesssim 0.2$, consistently with several previous studies. Moreover, provided sufficiently extended domains, we observe the emergence of large-scale flow structures with spanwise $\Lambda_{y} \approx 50$ and streamwise $\Lambda_{x} \lesssim 115$. ...</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional numerical study on hydrogen bubble growth at electrode</title>

Abstract: 3D direct numerical simulation of electrolysis is applied to investigate the growth and detachment of bubbles at electrodes.
  The moving gas-liquid interface is modeled employing the VOF-based method. To ensure the accuracy of the simulations,
  a mesh-independence study has been performed.
  The simulations include the growth phase of the bubbles followed by their detachment from the electrode surface
  and the results are validated with analytical models and experimental data.
  The bubble growth is diffusion controlled leading to the scaling $R = 2\beta t^{1/2}$, but the growth exponent is overpredicted by our simulation during initial stage.
  Furthermore, it is proved that the nucleation sites of the bubble strongly influence gas transport by measuring the relevant Sherwood number.
  Finally, we investigate the effects of contact angle and nucleation sites on bubble detachment behavior,
  and compare the detachment radius with Fritz's formula, the results show a good agreement,
  confirming that buoyancy is the dominant driving force.
  As the nucleation sites increase, the induced bubble coalescence accelerates the bubble detachment. Taken together,
  these findings give us valuable insights into improving gas bubble removal and enhancing overall electrolysis efficiency.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of 2D flat-sheet membrane filters for constant-pressure water purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membrane filtration is widely used in water treatment to remove foulants from contaminated water. Foulant build-up on the membrane occludes the area open for fluid flow, which impairs the efficiency of the filtration operation by decreasing the flux through the membrane. Backwashing is a strategy to restore the membrane, wherein clean water is processed backward through the membrane to dislodge attached foulants. We develop a Monte Carlo model to simulate constant-pressure forward filtration and backwashing through dead-end, flat-sheet membranes, with membrane fouling dominated by intermediate blocking. We validate our model against real-world experiments conducted with different foulant types and concentrations and run under different filtration conditions. Relying primarily on measurable physical parameters and employing easy-to-implement parameter fitting techniques as needed, we show good agreement between experimental data and numerical simulations. We extend these results to predict flux behavior in forward filtration and backwashing when foulant properties or filtration conditions are varied. The newly developed model can be used to further investigate the impact of varying backwashing duration, frequency, and/or pressure on the rate of flux recovery.</description>

      <title>Performance of an open-source image-based history matching framework for CO$_2$ storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a history matching (HM) workflow applied to the International FluidFlower benchmark study dataset, which features high-resolution images of CO$_2$ storage in a meter-scale, geologically complex reservoir. The dataset provides dense spatial and temporal observations of fluid displacement, offering a rare opportunity to validate and enhance HM techniques for geological carbon storage (GCS). The combination of detailed experimental data and direct visual observation of flow behavior at this scale is novel and valuable. This study explores the potential and limitations of using experimental data to calibrate standard models for GCS simulation. By leveraging high-resolution images and resulting interpretations of fluid phase distributions, we adjust uncertain parameters and reduce the mismatch between simulation results and observed data. Simulations are performed using the open-source OPM Flow simulator, while the open-source Everest decision-making tool is employed to conduct the HM. After the HM process, the final simulation results show good agreement with the experimental CO$_2$ storage data. This suggests that the system can be effectively described using standard flow equations, conventional saturation functions, and typical PVT properties for CO$_2$-brine mixtures. Our results demonstrate that the Wasserstein distance is a particularly effective metric for matching multi-phase, multi-component flow data. The entire workflow is implemented in a Python package named pofff (Python OPM Flow FluidFlower), which organizes all functionality through a single input file. This design ensures reproducibility and facilitates future extensions of the study.</description>
