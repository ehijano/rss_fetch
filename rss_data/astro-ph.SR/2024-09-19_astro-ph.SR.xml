      <title>Simulating Self-Lensing and Eclipsing Signals due to Detached Compact Objects in the TESS Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fraction of Galactic stars have compact companions which could be white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs) or stellar-mass black holes (SBHs). In a detached and edge-on binary system including a main-sequence star and a compact object (denoted by WDMS, NSMS, and BHMS systems), the stellar brightness can change periodically due to self-lensing or eclipsing features. The shape of a self-lensing signals is a degenerate function of stellar radius and compact object's mass because the self-lensing peak strongly depends on the projected source radius normalized to Einstein radius. Increasing the inclination angle $i$ changes the self-lensing shape from a strict top-hat model to one with slow-increasing edges. We simulate stellar light curves due to these binary systems which are observed by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope and evaluate the efficiencies to detect their periodic signatures using two sets of criteria (i)SNR$&gt;3$ and $N_{\rm{tran}}&gt;1$ (Low-Confidence, LC), and (ii) SNR$&gt;5$ and $N_{\rm{tran}}&gt;2$ (High-Confidence, HC). The HC efficiencies for detecting WDMS, NSMS, and BHMS systems with the inclination angle $i&lt;20^{\circ}$ during different time spans are $5$-$7\%$, $4.5$-$6\%$, and $4$-$5\%$, respectively. Detecting lensing-induced features is possible in only $\lesssim3\%$ and $\lesssim33\%$ of detectable WDMS and NSMS events. The detection efficiencies for closer source stars with higher priorities are higher and drop to zero for $b\gtrsim R_{\star}$, where $b\simeq \tan(i) a$ is the impact parameter($a$ is the semi-major axis). We predict the numbers of WDs, NSs, and SBHs that are discovered from the TESS Candidate Target List stars are $15$-$18$, $6$-$7$, and $&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Total Solar Irradiance during the last Millenium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar irradiance variations across various timescales, from minutes to centuries, represents a potential natural driver of past regional and global climate cold phases. To accurately assess the Sun's effect on climate, particularly during periods of exceptionally low solar activity known as grand minima, an accurate reconstruction of solar forcing is essential. While direct measurements of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) only began in the late 1970s with the advent of space radiometers, indirect evidence from various historical proxies suggests that the Sun's magnetic activity has undergone possible significant fluctuations over much longer timescales. Employing diverse and independent methods for TSI reconstruction is essential to gaining a comprehensive understanding of this issue. This study employs a semi-empirical model to reconstruct TSI over the past millennium. Our approach uses an estimated open solar magnetic field ($F_{o}$), derived from cosmogenic isotope data, as a proxy for solar activity. We reconstruct the cyclic variations of TSI, due to the solar surface magnetic features, by correlating $F_{o}$ with the parameter of active region functional form. Instead, we obtain the long-term TSI trend by applying the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm to the reconstructed $F_{o}$ to filter out the 11-year and 22-year solar variability. We prepare a reconstructed TSI record, spanning 971 to 2020 CE. The estimated departure from modern TSI values occurred during the Sp\"{o}rer Minimum (around 1400 CE), with a decrease of approximately 2.3 $W m^{-2}$. A slightly smaller decline of 2.2 $W m^{-2}$ is reported during the Maunder Minimum, between 1645 and 1715 CE.</description>

      <title>The radial modes of stars with suppressed dipole modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kepler space mission provided high-quality light curves for more than 16 000 red giants. The global stellar oscillations extracted from these light curves carry information about the interior of the stars. Several hundred red giants were found to have low amplitudes in their dipole modes (i.e. they are suppressed dipole-mode stars). A number of hypotheses (involving e.g. a magnetic field, binarity, or resonant mode coupling) have been proposed to explain the suppression of the modes, yet none has been confirmed.
  We aim to gain insight into the mechanism at play in suppressed dipole-mode stars by investigating the mode properties (linewidths, heights, and amplitudes) of the radial oscillation modes of red giants with suppressed dipole modes.
  We selected from the literature suppressed dipole-mode stars and compared the radial-mode properties of these stars to the radial-mode properties of stars in two control samples of stars with typical (i.e. non-suppressed) dipole modes.
  We find that the radial-mode properties of the suppressed dipole-mode stars are consistent with the ones in our control samples, and hence not affected by the suppression mechanism.
  From this we conclude that (1) the balance between the excitation and damping in radial modes is unaffected by the suppression, and by extrapolation the excitation of the non-radial modes is not affected either; and (2) the damping of the radial modes induced by the suppression mechanism is significantly less than the damping from turbulent convective motion, suggesting that the additional damping originates from the more central non-convective regions of the star, to which the radial modes are least sensitive.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Spectropolarimetry channel of Visible Emission Line Coronagraph onboard Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field strength and its topology play an important role in understanding the formation, evolution, and dynamics of the solar corona. Also, it plays a significant role in addressing long-standing mysteries such as coronal heating problem, origin and propagation of coronal mass ejections, drivers of space weather, origin and acceleration of solar wind, and so on. Despite having photospheric magnetograms for decades, we do not have reliable observations of coronal magnetic field strengths today. To measure the coronal magnetic field precisely, the spectropolarimetry channel of the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) on board the Aditya-L1 mission is designed. Using the observations of coronal emission line Fe XIII [10747{\AA~}], it is possible to generate full Stokes maps (I, Q, U, and V) that help in estimating the Line-of-Sight (LOS) magnetic field strength and to derive the magnetic field topology maps of solar corona in the Field of View (FOV) (1.05 -- 1.5~R$_{\odot}$). In this article, we summarize the instrumental details of the spectropolarimetry channel and detailed calibration procedures adopted to derive the modulation and demodulation matrices. Furthermore, we have applied the derived demodulation matrices to the observed data in the laboratory and studied their performance.</description>

      <title>Observations of microlensed images with dual-field interferometry: on-sky demonstration and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric observations of gravitational microlensing events offer an opportunity for precise, efficient, and direct mass and distance measurements of lensing objects, especially those of isolated neutron stars and black holes. However, such observations were previously possible for only a handful of extremely bright events. The recent development of a dual-field interferometer, GRAVITY Wide, has made it possible to reach out to significantly fainter objects, and increase the pool of microlensing events amenable to interferometric observations by two orders of magnitude. Here, we present the first successful observation of a microlensing event with GRAVITY Wide and the resolution of microlensed images in the event OGLE-2023-BLG-0061/KMT-2023-BLG-0496. We measure the angular Einstein radius of the lens with a sub-percent precision, $\theta_{\rm E} = 1.280 \pm 0.009$ mas. Combined with the microlensing parallax detected from the event light curve, the mass and distance to the lens are found to be $0.472 \pm 0.012 M_{\odot}$ and $1.81 \pm 0.05$ kpc, respectively. We present the procedure for the selection of targets for interferometric observations, and discuss possible systematic effects affecting GRAVITY Wide data. This detection demonstrates the capabilities of the new instrument and it opens up completely new possibilities for the follow-up of microlensing events, and future routine discoveries of isolated neutron stars and black holes.</description>

      <title>The NEID Earth Twin Survey. I. Confirmation of a 31-day planet orbiting HD 86728</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With close to three years of observations in hand, the NEID Earth Twin Survey (NETS) is starting to unearth new astrophysical signals for a curated sample of bright, radial velocity (RV)-quiet stars. We present the discovery of the first NETS exoplanet, HD 86728 b, a $m_p\sin i = 9.16^{+0.55}_{-0.56}\ \rm{M}_\oplus$ planet on a circular, $P=31.1503^{+0.0062}_{-0.0066}$ d orbit, thereby confirming a candidate signal identified by Hirsch et al. (2021). We confirm the planetary origin of the detected signal, which has a semi-amplitude of just $K=1.91^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$ m s$^{-1}$, via careful analysis of the NEID RVs and spectral activity indicators, and we constrain the mass and orbit via fits to NEID and archival RV measurements. The host star is intrinsically quiet at the $\sim1$ m s$^{-1}$ level, with the majority of this variability likely stemming from short-timescale granulation. HD 86728 b is among the small fraction of exoplanets with similar masses and periods that have no known planetary siblings.</description>

      <title>The Background Interstellar Medium as Observed from Off-Order Low-Resolution Spitzer-IRS Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spitzer 'hidden' observations of the background are used to construct a catalog of 4,090 spectra and examine the signature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and their connection to extinction by dust. A strong positive correlation is recovered between WISE12, E(B-V), and the 11.2 $\mu$m PAH band. For 0.06 $\leq$ E(B-V) $\leq$ 5.0, correlations of the 6.2, 11.2, and 12.7 $\mu$m PAH band are positive with E(B-V). Three dust temperature regimes are revealed. Correlations with WISE12 are well-constrained and that with 12.7/11.2 is flat. Decomposition with the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database reveals a tentative positive correlation between the 6.2/11.2 and the PAH ionization fraction, while that with 12.7/11.2 is slightly negative, suggesting PAH structural changes. The relation with PAH size and 6.2/11.2 is negative, while that with 12.7/11.2 is positive. Averaging spectra into five E(B-V) and three T$_{\rm dust}$ bins shows an evolution in PAH emission and variations in 12.7/11.2. Database-fits show an increase in $f_{\rm i}$ and the PAH ionization parameter $\gamma$, but a more stable large PAH fraction. While the largest $\gamma$s are associated with the highest T$_{\rm dust}$, there is no one-to-one correlation. The analysis is hampered by low-quality data at short wavelengths. There are indications that PAHs in the more-diffuse backgrounds behave differently from those in the general interstellar medium. However, they are often still associated with larger scale filamentary cloud-like structures. The spectra and auxiliary data have been made available through the Ames Background Interstellar Medium Spectral Catalog and may guide JWST programs.</description>

      <title>Star cluster formation from turbulent clumps. IV. Protoplanetary disc evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stars are born in the crowded environments of gradually forming star clusters. Dynamical interactions between close-passing stars and the evolving UV radiation fields from proximate massive stars are expected to sculpt the protoplanetary discs in these clusters, potentially contributing to the diversity of planetary systems that we observe. Here, we investigate the impact of cluster environment on disc demographics by implementing simple protoplanetary disc evolution models within $N$-body simulations of gradual star cluster formation. We consider a range of star formation efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, and mass surface density of the natal cloud environment, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, both of which affect the overall duration of cluster formation. We track the interaction history of all stars to estimate the dynamical truncation of the discs around stars involved in close encounters. We also track external photoevaporation of the discs due to the ionizing radiation field of the nearby high- and intermediate-mass ($&gt; 5 M_\odot$) stars. We find that $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, and the degree of primordial binarity have major influences on the masses and radii of the disc population. In particular, external photo-evaporation has a greater impact than dynamical interactions in determining the fate of discs in our clusters.</description>

      <title>Allowed and forbidden beta-decay log ft values of neutron-rich Pb and Bi isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The beta-decay log ft values for 210 215Pb 210 215Bi and 210 215Bi 210 215Po transitions in the north east region of 208Pb nuclei are estimated using the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation model. The pn-QRPA equations were solved using the schematic model approach. The Woods Saxon (WS) potential was inserted as a mean field basis and nuclei were treated as spherical. Allowed Gamow Teller (GT) and first forbidden (FF) transitions were investigated in the particle hole (ph) channel. The calculated log ft values of the allowed GT and FF transitions using the pn-QRPA(WS) were found closer to the experimental values. Later we performed calculation of beta-decay rates in stellar environment. Here we solved the RPA equations in deformed Nilsson basis, both in the particle particle (pp) and particle hole (ph) channels. Allowed beta decay and unique first-forbidden (U1F) rates were calculated in stellar matter. For certain cases, the calculated U1F contribution was much more than the allowed beta decay rates under prevailing stellar conditions in line with previous findings. Increasing temperature of the stellar core affected the allowed GT rates more than the U1F rates.</description>

      <title>Higher-order moment convergent method in weakly anisotropic plasma and the NLVFP code for solution of the 0D-2V Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusion plasma is a typical non-equilibrium and nonlinear system, with the interaction between different species well described by the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equations. The transport of mass, momentum, energy, and temperature relaxation are important issues, which are affected by the collision term of VFP even in so-called collision-less plasma domain. Hence, nonlinearity and collisions are crucial features in large regime. A successful numerical simulation for non-equilibrium plasma has to be able to conserve mass, momentum and energy, while to satisfy Boltzmann's H-theorem and higher-order moment convergence. An expansion of the distribution function in spherical harmonics (Legendre basis when the velocity space exhibits axisymmetry) in angle coordinate and in King basis in speed coordinate of velocity space is well suited to address these requirements. This paper reviews the formulation of the 0D-2V VFP equation in terms of spherical harmonics coupled with King function and its solution in our NLVFP code. In this topic review, we will introduce the background physics related to the nonlinear VFP simulation, then describe NLVFP for 0D-2V homogeneous, weakly anisotropic plasma with utilization of the Shkarofsky's form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FPRS) collision operator.</description>

      <title>Radial Diffusion Driven by Spatially Localized ULF Waves in the Earth's Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves are critical drivers of particle acceleration and loss in the Earth's magnetosphere. While statistical models of ULF-induced radial transport have traditionally assumed that the waves are uniformly distributed across magnetic local time (MLT), decades of observational evidence show significant MLT localization of ULF waves in the Earth's magnetosphere. This study presents, for the first time, a quasi-linear radial diffusion coefficient accounting for localized ULF waves. We demonstrate that even though quasi-linear radial diffusion is averaged over drift orbits, MLT localization significantly alters the efficiency of particle transport. Our results reveal that when ULF waves cover more than 30\% of the MLT, the radial diffusion efficiency is comparable to that of uniform wave distributions. However, when ULF waves are confined within 10\% of the drift orbit, the diffusion coefficient is enhanced by 10 to 25\%, indicating that narrowly localized ULF waves are efficient drivers of radial transport.</description>

      <title>Rotationally inelastic rate coefficients for C$_7$N$^{-}$ and C$_{10}$H$^{-}$ anions in collision with H$_2$ at interstellar conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anions C$_7$N$^-$ and C$_{10}$H$^-$ are the two longest of the linear (C,N)-bearing and (C,H)-bearing chains which have so far been detected in the Interstellar Medium. In order to glean information on their collision-induced rotational state-changing processes, we analyse the general features of new ab initio potentials describing the interaction of both linear anions with H$_2$, one of the most abundant partners in their ISM environment. We employ an artificial neural network fit of the reduced-dimensionality potential energy surface for C$_7$N$^-$...H$_2$ interaction and discuss in detail the spatial features in terms of multipolar radial coefficients. For the C$_{10}$H$^-$...H$_2$ interaction we use the initial grid of two dimensional raw points to generate by quadrature the Legendre expansion directly, further including the long-range terms as discussed in the main text. Quantum scattering calculations are employed to obtain rotationally inelastic cross sections, for collision energies in the range of 10$^{-4}$ to 400 cm$^{-1}$. From them we generate the corresponding inelastic rate coefficients as a function of temperature covering the range from 10 to 50 K. The results for the rate coefficients for the longest cyanopolyyne are compared with the earlier results obtained for the smaller terms of the same series, also in collision with H$_2$. We obtain that the inelastic rate coefficients for the long linear anions are all fairly large compared with the earlier systems. The consequences of such findings on their non-equilibrium rotational populations in interstellar environments are illustrated in our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Conference Summary: Stellar Feedback in the ISM: Celebrating the Life and Work of You-Hua Chu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this conference summary I first provide some historical notes on my own collaboration with You-Hua Chu and on the discovery of X-rays from superbubbles by Margarita Rosado S. I then consider the central subject of the conference, stellar feedback, and how interactions between stellar winds and the interstellar medium can limit or enhance the effects of feedback compared to models including only supernova explosions. Finally, I review results in other areas covered by the conference, including planet and star formation, nova and supernova remnants, different topics in stellar evolution and interaction with the interstellar medium, star clusters, observational surveys, and observational and numerical techniques.</description>

      <title>Fractional Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the possibility of starting the process of collapsing and forming stars from a fractional molecular cloud. Although the Verlinde's approach is employed to derive the corresponding gravitational potential, the results are easily generalizable to other gravitational potential proposals for fractional systems. It is due to the fact that the different methods, despite the difference in the details of results, all obtain power forms for the potential in terms of radius. An essential result of this analysis is the derivation of the corresponding Jeans mass limit, which is a crucial parameter in understanding the formation of stars. The study shows that the Jeans mass of a cloud in fractional gravity is much smaller than the traditional value. In addition, the study also determines the burning temperature of the resulting star using the Gamow theory. This calculation provides insight into the complex processes that govern the evolution of these celestial bodies. Finally, the study briefly discusses the investigation of hydrostatic equilibrium, a crucial condition that ensures the stability of these fractional stars. It also addresses the corresponding Lane--Emden equation, which is pivotal in understanding this equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Search For Mid-Infrared Excesses Among Five Million Main-Sequence FGK Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar infrared excesses can indicate various phenomena of interest, from protoplanetary disks to debris disks, or (more speculatively) techno-signatures along the lines of Dyson spheres. In this paper, we conduct a large search for such excesses, designed as a data-driven contextual anomaly detection pipeline. We focus our search on FGK stars close to the main sequence to favour non-young host stars. We look for excess in the mid-infrared, unlocking a large sample to search in while favouring extreme IR excess akin to the ones produced by Extreme Debris Disks (EDD). We combine observations from ESA Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and the unWISE of NASA WISE, and create a catalogue of 4,898,812 stars with $G &lt; 16$ mag. We consider a star to have an excess if it is substantially brighter in $W1$ and $W2$ bands than what is predicted from an ensemble of machine-learning models trained on the data, taking optical and near-infrared information as input features. We apply a set of additional cuts (derived from the ML models and the objects' astronomical features) to avoid false-positive and identify a set of 53 objects (a rate of $1.1\times 10^{-5}$), including one previously identified EDD candidate. Typical infrared-excess fractional luminosities we find are in the range 0.005 to 0.1, consistent with known EDDs.</description>

      <title>Second-generation planet formation after tidal disruption from common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that certain white dwarf (WD) planets, such as WD 1856+534 b, may form out of material from a stellar companion that tidally disrupts from common envelope (CE) evolution with the WD progenitor star. The disrupted companion shreds into an accretion disc, out of which a gas giant protoplanet forms due to gravitational instability. To explore this scenario, we make use of detailed stellar evolution models consistent with WD 1856+534. The minimum mass companion that produces a gravitationally-unstable disk after tidal disruption is $\sim$$0.15\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Planet formation from tidal disruption is a new channel for producing second-generation planets around WDs.</description>

      <title>Circumstellar Interaction in the Ultraviolet Spectra of SN 2023ixf 14-66 Days After Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf was discovered in M101 within a day of explosion and rapidly classified as a Type II supernova with flash features. Here we present ultraviolet (UV) spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope 14, 19, 24, and 66 days after explosion. Interaction between the supernova ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) is seen in the UV throughout our observations in the flux of the first three epochs and asymmetric Mg II emission on day 66. We compare our observations to CMFGEN supernova models that include CSM interaction ($\dot{M}&lt;10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and find that the power from CSM interaction is decreasing with time, from $L_{\rm sh}\approx5\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $L_{\rm sh}\approx1\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ between days 14 and 66. We examine the contribution of individual atomic species to the spectra on days 14 and 19, showing that the majority of the features are dominated by iron, nickel, magnesium, and chromium absorption in the ejecta. The UV spectral energy distribution of SN 2023ixf sits between that of supernovae which show no definitive signs of CSM interaction and those with persistent signatures assuming the same progenitor radius and metallicity. Finally, we show that the evolution and asymmetric shape of the Mg II $\lambda\lambda$ 2796, 2802 emission are not unique to SN 2023ixf. These observations add to the early measurements of dense, confined CSM interaction, tracing the mass-loss history of SN 2023ixf to $\sim33$ yr prior to the explosion and the density profile to a radius of $\sim5.7\times10^{15}$ cm. They show the relatively short evolution from a quiescent red supergiant wind to high mass loss.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength spectroscopic analysis of the ULX Holmberg II X-1 and its nebula suggests the presence of a heavy black hole accreting from a B-type donor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are high-mass X-ray binaries with an X-ray luminosity above $10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These ULXs can be powered by black holes that are more massive than $20M_\odot$, accreting in a standard regime, or lighter compact objects accreting supercritically. There are only a few ULXs with known optical or UV counterparts, and their nature is debated. Determining whether optical/UV radiation is produced by the donor star or by the accretion disc is crucial for understanding ULX physics and testing massive binary evolution. We conduct, for the first time, a fully consistent multi-wavelength spectral analysis of a ULX and its circumstellar nebula. We aim to establish the donor star type and test the presence of strong disc winds in the prototypical ULX Holmberg II X-1 (Ho II X-1). We intent to obtain a realistic spectral energy distribution of the ionising source, which is needed for robust nebula analysis. We acquired new UV spectra of Ho II X-1 with the HST and complemented them with archival optical and X-ray data. We explored the spectral energy distribution of the source and analysed the spectra using the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and the photoionisation code Cloudy. Our analysis of the X-ray, UV, and optical spectra of Ho II X-1 and its nebula consistently explains the observations. We do not find traces of disc wind signatures in the UV and the optical, rejecting previous claims of the ULX being a supercritical accretor. The optical/UV counterpart of HoII X-1 is explained by a B-type supergiant donor star. Thus, the observations are fully compatible with Ho II X-1 being a close binary consisting of an $\gtrsim 66\,M_\odot$ black hole accreting matter from an $\simeq 22 M_\odot$ B-supergiant companion. Also, we propose a possible evolution scenario for the system, suggesting that Ho II X-1 is a potential gravitational wave source progenitor.</description>
