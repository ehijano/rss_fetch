      <title>Engineering subgap states in superconductors by altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Interstitial oxygen order and its competition with superconductivity in La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics. While early samples exhibited limited superconducting volume fractions, Pr substitution for La enabled bulk superconductivity in polycrystals under pressure and enhanced transition temperatures in thin films at ambient pressure. Beyond rare-earth doping, moderate oxygen or ozone annealing improves superconductivity by mitigating oxygen vacancies, whereas high-pressure oxygen annealing leads to a trivial, non-superconducting metallic state across all pressure regimes. These findings highlight the need to elucidate both the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry in modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. Here, using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ and high-pressure-oxygen-annealed La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ polycrystals. We find that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, effectively eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies and ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ that is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers into p-d hybridized orbitals, ultimately suppressing superconductivity. This behavior starkly contrasts with cuprate superconductors, where similar interstitial oxygen ordering enhances superconductivity instead. Our findings reveal a competition between striped interstitial oxygen order and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, offering key insights into their distinct pairing mechanisms and providing a roadmap for designing more robust superconducting phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bipolar Thermoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectricity usually originates from energy-dependent transport asymmetries. In this Letter, we explore a purely quantum thermoelectric effect rooted in the emission/absorption asymmetry of a low-temperature quantum bath. We propose a gap-asymmetric S-I-S' superconducting tunnel junction in thermal equilibrium, coupled to a low-temperature electromagnetic environment, which develops a nonlinear quantum bipolar thermoelectric effect due to the dynamical Coulomb blockade. Key performance features are analyzed for realistic implementations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking-induced topology in FeSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FeSe has been one of the most intensively studied iron-based superconductors over the past two decades, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, nematic order, magnetism, orbital-selective correlations, and structural phase transitions. While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases - such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe - topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the in-plane $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using topological quantum chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and the structural transition to the orthorhombic low-temperature phase lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium nonlinear model of thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectricity in superconducting tunnel junctions has always been studied under the hypothesis of equilibrium between the cold side and the thermal bath, usually in the linear regime. We define a more complete out-of-equilibrium nonlinear numerical model that reduces to the equilibrium linear model in the low-power limit. We find that the linear model does not correctly describe the behavior of superconducting tunnel junctions for parameters that are reasonable in practical experimental setups. Subsequently, we present the qualitative and quantitative differences between the models, discovering that for high power, the junction saturates and then inverts its behavior. Finally, we also clarify the difference between linear and nonlinear thermoelectricity and devise a new criterion to find nonlinear thermoelectricity in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Topological Chiral Superconductivity Mediated by Intervalley Antiferromagnetic Fluctuations in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$), we theoretically investigate the superconductivity driven by electronic mechanism. We first demonstrate that the multi-band screened Coulomb interaction within the random phase approximation is insufficient to induce observable pairing instability. Nevertheless, by further including the intervalley antiferromagnetic fluctuations, the pairing interaction is substantially enhanced, yielding superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c$ of hundreds of millikelvin at van Hove singularities. The predicted $T_c$ increases with increasing the displacement field and corresponds to a doubly-degenerate $d$-wave-like pairing, which evolves into topological chiral $d \pm id$ superconductor below $T_c$. The interplay between superconductivity and intervalley antiferromagnetism results in a phase diagram consistent with experimental observations.These findings establish intervalley fluctuations as the primary pairing glue in tWSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Voltage-tunable spin supercurrent nonreciprocity reaching 100% efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting version of a diode effect has been the subject of extensive research in the past few years. So far, the focus has almost exclusively been on charge transport, but a natural question is whether it is possible to obtain nonreciprocal spin transport without dissipation. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate electrically tunable nonreciprocal spin transport carried by a supercurrent using superconductor/ferromagnet multilayers. The nonreciprocal spin supercurrent reaches an ideal efficiency of 100%, meaning that the spin-polarization of the critical current is finite in one flow direction whereas it vanishes in the other direction. We explain the underlying physics generating this phenomenon. This result provides a way to integrate nonreciprocal supercurrents with spin-polarization, offering new functionality in quantum technologies based on Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetism and topological superconductivity on an unconventional superconducting platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model to investigate the interplay between altermagnetism and $p$-wave superconductivity, with a particular focus on topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both chiral and helical phases. Our study reveals that the emergence of helical and chiral Majorana states can be tuned by the amplitude of a $d-$wave altermagnetic order parameter, with the outcome depending on the nature of the superconducting state. In the helical superconductor, such an altermagnet can induce a topological phase transition into a gapless topological superconductor hosting Majorana flat edge modes. On the other hand, in the chiral superconductor, the topological transition takes place between a topologically nontrivial gapped phase and a gapless nodal-line superconductor, where the Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands intersect at an isolated line in momentum space. Remarkably, we show that when such an altermagnet is coupled to a mixed-pairing superconductor, with both chiral and helical components, a hybrid topological phase emerges, featuring dispersive Majorana edge modes that coexist with nearly flat Majorana edge states. Our findings therefore establish a novel platform for controlling and manipulating Majorana modes in unconventional superconductors with vanishing total magnetization.</description>

      <title>Hybrid magnon -- Nambu-Goldstone excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator thin-film heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Theory of hybrid collective excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for the dynamical proximity effect in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) hybrid structures. Our approach combines the nonequilibrium quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel equations for the electronic Green's functions in the TS with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governing the magnetization dynamics in the FI. Within this framework, we study the proximity-induced coupling between magnons and superconducting collective excitations. We find that the spin-momentum locking intrinsic to the surface state of the TS leads to a hybridization between the superconducting Nambu-Goldstone (phase) collective mode and magnons, resulting in the emergence of composite magnon-Nambu-Goldstone excitations. The dependence of the coupling strength on relevant physical parameters is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, we show that the Higgs (amplitude) mode does not couple to magnons at linear order and therefore does not participate in the formation of hybrid collective excitations.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>
