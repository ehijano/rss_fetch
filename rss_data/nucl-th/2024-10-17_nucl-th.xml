      <title>An end-to-end generative diffusion model for heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We train a generative diffusion model (DM) to simulate ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions from end to end. The model takes initial entropy density profiles as input and produces two-dimensional final particle spectra, successfully reproducing integrated and differential observables. It also captures higher-order fluctuations and correlations. These findings suggest that the generative model has successfully learned the complex relationship between initial conditions and final particle spectra for various shear viscosities, as well as the fluctuations introduced during initial entropy production and hadronization stages, providing an efficient framework for resource-intensive physical goals. The code and trained model are available at https://huggingface.co/Jing-An/DiffHIC/tree/main.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Correlation Anisotropies in p + p Collisions Simulated by Pythia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated by the keen interest of possible collective behavior in high-energy proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, we study two-particle angular correlations in pseudorapidity and azimuthal differences in simulated p + p interactions by the Pythia 8 event generator. Multi-parton interactions and color connection are included in these simulations which have been perceived to produce collectivity in final-state particles. Meanwhile, contributions from genuine few-body nonflow correlations, not of collective flow behavior, are known to be severe in those small-system collisions. We present our Pythia correlation studies in a pedagogical way and report azimuthal harmonic anisotropies analyzed by several methods. We observe anisotropies in those Pythia simulated events qualitatively and semi-quantitatively similar to experimental data. Our findings highlight the delicate nature of azimuthal anisotropies in small-system collisions, and provide a benchmark helping improve data analysis and interpret experimental measurements in small-system collisions.</description>

      <title>Systematics of supernumerary nuclear rainbow in inelastic $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of inelastic nuclear rainbow scattering for the \oc system to the 2$^+$ (4.44 MeV) state of $^{12}$C at incident energies of 100--608 MeV with the coupled-channels method. The recently generalized nearside-farside decomposition for inelastic scattering was applied in combination with the multichannel deflection function analysis to elucidate the origin of the nuclear rainbow phenomenon and the suppression of the primary and supernumerary Airy minima in the inelastic scattering cross section. The systematic evolution of the Airy minima for the excited 2$^+$ (4.44 MeV) state of $^{12}$C was unambiguously determined. Our work suggests that there is no clear shift in the positions of the first Airy minima and a small shift at low energies for the second and third Airy minima between the inelastic and elastic scattering cross sections. Using the $K$-subamplitudes splitting technique combined with the generalized nearside-farside decomposition and deflection function, the distinct refractive pattern commonly suppressed in the inelastic heavy-ion scattering can be interpreted and provides new insights into the relationship between elastic and inelastic nuclear rainbow scattering.</description>

      <title>Impact parameter dependence of the effect of background field on coupling constant in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the impact parameter dependence of the background field's effect on the coupling constant of the $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow l^{+} l^{-} \gamma$ process in heavy-ion collisions. The peripheral electric fields of heavy ions collide, and after photon annihilation into lepton pairs, the subsequent emission of radiation photons will be affected by the background field. Numerical estimates indicate that the dependence of this effect on the impact parameter is significant during this process.</description>

      <title>Negative moments as the signature of the radial density at small distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper proposes a robust evaluation of any radial density at small distances using negative-order radial moments evaluated in momentum space. This evaluation provides a valuable insight into the behavior of a given radial density in the vicinity of $r=0$, and puts strong emphasis on the importance of measuring form factors at large squared four-momentum transfer, a domain essential for the determination of negative order moments. A specific attention is paid to the regularization scheme directly affecting the numerical determination of the radial density's parametrization. The proposed method is applied to non-relativistic study cases of the nucleon electric ($G_{En}, G_{Ep}$), and proton magnetic $G_{Mp}$ form factors. The validation is performed through comparison of the results of the approach to the analytically determined Maclaurin expansion - in the vicinity of $r=0$ - of the radial density function. The method is also applied to the relativistic Dirac form factor $F_1$ of the proton. In such a non-trivial case, the Maclaurin development might not exist for the radial density, rendering the determination from the proposed method extremely important.</description>

      <title>Microscopic description of spontaneous fission based on a Gogny energy density functional including tensor contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends previous studies on the impact of tensor forces in fission dynamics of neutron-deficient Thorium isotopes to other isotopic chains of heavy actinides and low-mass super-heavy nuclei. Calculations are carried out within a mean-field framework based on the Gogny-D1S parametrization supplemented with the D1ST2a perturbative tensor term as driving force. Fission barrier heights and spontaneous fission half-lives are used as benchmarks to analyze the impact of the tensor term. A significant reduction of fission barrier heights and half-lives is associated to the tensor component of the force.</description>

      <title>Neutron-neutron distribution of the triton from pionless EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the neutron-neutron relative-energy distribution of the triton following the hard knockout of the proton in pionless effective field theory. This distribution can be used to study universality as well as to obtain information on the neutron-neutron interaction. Especially, one can infer the scattering length from fitting theory predictions for the shape of the distribution to experimental data. To obtain the distribution for the triton, we first solve the ground-state three-body problem using momentum-space Faddeev equations. Next, we include the neutron-neutron final-state interaction by applying the corresponding M{\o}ller operator to the ground state. We present leading-order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) pionless effective field theory results with quantified uncertainties. At NLO, we include the effective ranges semi-perturbatively. We conclude, that pionless EFT works reliably as expected and that the neutron-neutron distribution of the triton shows a significant sensitivity to the scattering length.</description>

      <title>Effects of threshold resummation for large-$x$ PDF in large momentum effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) at large $x$ are challenging to extract from experimental data, yet they are essential for understanding hadron structure and searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Within the framework of the large momentum $P^z$ expansion of lattice quasi-PDFs, we investigate large $x$ PDFs, where the matching coefficient is factorized into the hard kernel, related to the active quark momentum $x P^z$, and the threshold soft function, associated with the spectator momentum $(1-x) P^z$. The renormalization group equation of the soft function enables the resummation of the threshold double logarithms $\alpha^{k} \ln^{2k-1}(1-x)$, which is crucial for a reliable and controllable calculation of large $x$ PDFs. Our analysis with pion valence PDFs indicates that perturbative matching breaks down when the spectator momentum $(1-x)P^z$ approaches $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$, but remains valid when both $x P^z$ and $(1-x)P^z$ are much larger than $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. Additionally, we incorporate leading renormalon resummation within the threshold framework, demonstrating good perturbative convergence in the region where both spectator and active quark momenta are perturbative scales.</description>

      <title>Sketching pion and proton mass distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A light-front holographic model is used to illustrate an algebraic scheme for constructing a representation of a hadron's zero-skewness generalised parton distribution (GPD) from its valence-quark distribution function (DF) and electromagnetic form factor, $F_H$, without reference to deeply virtual Compton scattering data. The hadron's mass distribution gravitational form factor, $A_H$, calculated from this GPD is harder than $F_H$; and, for each hadron, the associated mass-density profile is more compact than the analogous charge profile, with each pion near-core density being larger than that of its proton partner. These features are independent of the scheme employed.</description>

      <title>The Theoretical Study of $\Sigma^{+} p \to\Lambda a_0^{+} p$ Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a theoretical study on the process $\Sigma^{+} p \to\Lambda a_0^{+} p$ based on an effective Lagrangian approach. This model encompasses the excitation of intermediate states leading to the production of $\Delta(1920)$ through $\pi^{+}$ and $K^{+}$ meson exchanges between the initial $\Sigma^{+}$ baryon and the initial proton $p$, as well as the generation of $\Delta(1940)$ via $\pi^{+}$ and $\rho^{+}$ meson exchanges. We provide predictions for the total and differential cross sections and discuss the potential impacts of cutoff parameters, off-shell effects, and branching ratios on the $\Delta^{\ast} \to a_0 p$ decay. Given the dominance of $\Delta(1940)$ in the region close to the reaction threshold, this reaction is considered an ideal platform for deeply exploring the unique properties of the $\Delta(1940)$ resonance. Through this approach, we can gain a more precise understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of this particle.</description>

      <title>Twist-3 contribution in the Drell-Yan process with tensor-polarized deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensor-polarized structures of the deuteron can be probed through the proton-deuteron Drell-Yan process, where the proton is unpolarized and the deuteron is tensor-polarized. This measurement will be conducted at Fermilab in the near future. In this reaction, the twist-3 contribution is not negligible compared to the twist-2 contribution due to the limited invariant mass of the dilepton pair. We calculate the twist-3 contribution for the Drell-Yan cross section with a tensor-polarized deuteron target, preserving the U(1)-gauge invariance of the hadronic tensor. The cross sections and weighted cross sections are expressed in terms of the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions (PDFs), thus one can extract the PDFs $f_{1\scriptscriptstyle{LL}}$, $f_{\scriptscriptstyle{LT}}$, and $f^{(1)}_{\scriptscriptstyle{1LT}}$ from the experimental measurements of Drell-Yan process. Our study should be helpful to solve the puzzle in the tensor-polarized structures of the deuteron.</description>

      <title>Confined but chirally and chiral spin symmetric hot matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the quark--antiquark mesons at zero and finite temperature in the framework of a solvable chirally symmetric quark model with linear confining potential. The interquark interaction in the model is reminiscent of that derived in Coulomb gauge QCD, with the string tension being the only model parameter. We demonstrate that while the confining interaction induces spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, chiral symmetry gets restored at a temperature Tch ~ 90 MeV for the string tension fixed to provide the phenomenological value of the quark condensate. This temperature is similar to Tch ~ 130 MeV observed on the lattice in the chiral limit for N_c=3. The physical mechanism responsible for the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime is Pauli blocking of the quark levels, required for the existence of a nonvanishing quark condensate, by the thermal excitations of the quarks and antiquarks. Thus, above the chiral restoration temperature, the meson-like states are chirally symmetric and approximately chiral spin symmetric. A crucial property of the confined meson-like light-light states above Tch is their size that exceeds drastically that in the chirally broken phase below Tch, in contrast to the heavy-heavy mesons that nearly preserve their size irrespective of the temperature. This property is a result of Pauli blocking of the quark and antiquark levels with small momenta. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radius of the states with J=0,1 diverges in the chiral limit. This unexpected property must be a key to understanding unusual features of the hot QCD matter as observed at RHIC and LHC. Consequently, the confining but chirally symmetric matter above Tch can be considered as a dense system of very large and strongly overlapping meson-like states (``strings'').</description>

      <title>Heavy-light Pseudoscalar Mesons: Light-Front Wave Functions and Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The internal structure of the lowest-lying pseudo-scalar mesons with heavy-light quark content is thoroughly studied using an algebraic model that has been successfully applied to similar physical observables of pseudoscalar and vector mesons with hidden-flavor quark content, ranging from light to heavy quark sectors. This model is based on constructing simple and evidence-based ans\"atze for the mesons' Bethe-Salpeter amplitude (BSA) and quark propagator, allowing the Bethe-Salpeter wave function (BSWF) to be computed algebraically. Its projection onto the light front yields the corresponding light-front wave function (LFWF), which provides easy access to the valence-quark Parton Distribution Amplitude (PDA) by integrating over the transverse momentum squared. We leverage our current knowledge of the PDAs of the lowest-lying pseudo-scalar heavy-light mesons to compute their Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) via the overlap representation of the LFWFs. From this three-dimensional information, various limits and projections allow us to deduce the related Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), Electromagnetic Form Factors (EFFs), and Impact Parameter Space GPDs (IPS-GPDs). Whenever possible, we make explicit comparisons with available experimental results and previous theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Proton internal pressure from deeply virtual Compton scattering on collider kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique experimental connection to the QCD energy-momentum tensor offered by generalised parton distributions has been strongly highlighted in the past few years with attempts to extract the pressure and shear forces distributions within the nucleon. If, in principle, this can be performed in a model independent way from experimental data, in practice, the current limited precision and kinematic coverage make such an extraction very challenging. Moreover, the limitation to a leading-order description in the strong coupling of the data has provided only an indirect and weakly sensitive access to gluon degrees of freedoms, solely through their mixing to quarks via evolution. In this paper we address this issue by pro viding a next-to-leading order formalism allowing a reanalysis of global fits with genuine gluonic degrees of freedom. In addition, we provide an estimate of the reduction in uncertainty that could stem from the extended kinematic range relevant for the future Electron Ion Collider. Finally, we stress the connection between the analysis of the dispersion relation in terms of generalised parton distributions and the deconvolution problem.</description>

Using the chiral $SU(3)$ quark mean field model, we have taken into account the impact on in-medium scalar meson fields to investigate the density effects on the in-medium baryon masses and their constituent quarks. In light of chiral constituent quark model $\chi$CQM, we have calculated the magnetic moments of $\frac{1}{2}^-$ baryon resonances and scrutinized the explicit contributions coming from the valence quarks, sea quarks and the orbital angular momentum of sea quarks. The effective baryonic magnetic moments have been investigated for the varying values of isospin asymmetry and strangeness fraction.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal modulation in light-by-light scattering from ultraperipheral collisions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastic light-by-light (LbL) scattering, one of the most fascinating processes in the Standard Model (SM), has recently been observed in the ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of relativistic heavy ions in the Atlas and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, the measured LbL cross section exhibits noticeable tension with the SM predictions based on the collinear factorization approach. Recognizing that the incident quasi-real photons in LbL scattering are strongly linearly polarized, we re-investigate the LbL scattering at UPCs by incorporating the joint dependence of the impact parameter and transverse momenta of the incident photons. Accounting for these effects alleviates the tension between the Atlas measurements and the preceding predictions from collinear factorization. Moreover, we show that the linear polarization of incident photons generates a sizable $\cos2\phi$-type azimuthal modulation, which awaits the test in future LHC and EIC/EicC experiments.</description>

      <title>Observation of string-breaking dynamics in a quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous particle-pair formation is a fundamental phenomenon in nature. It can, for example, appear when the potential energy between two particles increases with separation, as if they were connected by a tense string. Beyond a critical separation, new particle pairs can form, causing the string to break. String-breaking dynamics in quantum chromodynamics play a vital role in high-energy particle collisions and early universe evolution. Simulating string evolution and hadron formation is, therefore, a grand challenge in modern physics. Quantum simulators, well-suited for studying dynamics, are expected to outperform classical computing methods. However, the required experimental capabilities to simulate string-breaking dynamics have not yet been demonstrated, even for simpler models of the strong force. We experimentally probe, for the first time, the spatiotemporal dynamics of string-breaking in a (1+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory using a fully programmable trapped-ion quantum simulator. We emulate external static charges and strings via site-dependent magnetic-field control enabled by a dual array of tightly focused laser beams targeting individual ions. First, we study how confinement affects isolated charges, finding that they freely spread without string tension but exhibit localized oscillations when tension is increased. Then, we observe and characterize string-breaking dynamics of a string stretched between two static charges after an abrupt increase in string tension. Charge pairs appear near the string edges and spread into the bulk, revealing a route to dynamical string-breaking distinct from the conventional Schwinger mechanism. Our work demonstrates that analog quantum simulators have achieved the necessary control to explore string-breaking dynamics, which may ultimately be relevant to nuclear and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Interference of resonances in two-proton emission of $^{16}$Ne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15017v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the two-proton ($2p$) emission from $^{16}$Ne with the time-dependent $^{14}$O$+p+p$ three-body calculations. Two $0^+$ resonances are suggested to participate. For the $0^+_1$ resonance, the true emission of the spatially localized two protons is dominant, if the single-particle $s_{1/2}$ resonance locates above the $2p$ energy. By evaluating a time-evolution probability, the $0^+_2$ resonance is suggested at $\cong 3$ MeV from the $2p$ threshold. The inclusion of $0^+_2$ resonance makes the true-$2p$~emission more dominant in the time-dependent calculations.</description>

      <title>The triton lifetime from nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a calculation of the triton $\beta$-decay lifetime using Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion. By incorporating a non-perturbative treatment of the higher-order corrections, we achieve consistent predictions for the Fermi and Gamow-Teller matrix elements, which are crucial for determining the triton lifetime. Our results are consistent with earlier theoretical calculations, confirming the robustness of our approach. This study marks a significant advancement in the systematic application of NLEFT to nuclear $\beta$-decay processes, paving the way for future high-precision calculations in more complex nuclear systems. Additionally, we discuss potential improvements to our approach, including the explicit inclusion of two-pion exchange mechanisms and the refinement of three-nucleon forces. These developments are essential for extending the applicability of NLEFT to a broader range of nuclear phenomena, including neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Role of neutron pairing with density-gradient dependence in the semi-microscopic treatment of the inner crust of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the fourth-order extended Thomas-Fermi method with Strutinsky-integral shell and pairing corrections, we calculate the inner crust of neutron stars with the BSk31 functional, whose pairing has two terms: i) a term that is fitted to the results of microscopic calculations on homogeneous nuclear matter (accounting for both medium polarization and self-energy effects) that are more realistic than those of our earlier functionals; ii) an empirical term that is dependent on the density gradient, which permits an excellent fit to nuclear masses. Both proton and neutron pairing are taken into account, the former in the BCS theory and the latter in the local density approximation. We found that the equilibrium value of the proton number $Z$ remains 40 over the entire density range considered, whether or not neutron pairing is included. The new equation of state and the composition are very similar to those of our previously preferred functional, BSk24. However, the predicted neutron pairing fields are quite different. In particular, clusters are found to be impermeable to the neutron superfluid. The implications for the neutron superfluid dynamics are briefly discussed. Since the new pairing is more realistic, the functional BSk31 is better suited for investigating neutron superfluidity in neutron-star crusts.</description>

      <title>Hard jet substructure in a multistage approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present predictions and postdictions for a wide variety of hard jet-substructure observables using a multistage model within the JETSCAPE framework. The details of the multistage model and the various parameter choices are described in [A. Kumar et al., arXiv:2204.01163]. A novel feature of this model is the presence of two stages of jet modification: a high virtuality phase [modeled using the modular all twist transverse-scattering elastic-drag and radiation model (MATTER)], where modified coherence effects diminish medium-induced radiation, and a lower virtuality phase [modeled using the linear Boltzmann transport model (LBT)], where parton splits are fully resolved by the medium as they endure multiple scattering induced energy loss. Energy-loss calculations are carried out on event-by-event viscous fluid dynamic backgrounds constrained by experimental data. The uniform and consistent descriptions of multiple experimental observables demonstrate the essential role of modified coherence effects and the multistage modeling of jet evolution. Using the best choice of parameters from [A. Kumar et al., arXiv:2204.01163], and with no further tuning, we present calculations for the medium modified jet fragmentation function, the groomed jet momentum fraction $z_g$ and angular separation $r_g$ distributions, as well as the nuclear modification factor of groomed jets. These calculations provide accurate descriptions of published data from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider. Furthermore, we provide predictions from the multistage model for future measurements at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.</description>
