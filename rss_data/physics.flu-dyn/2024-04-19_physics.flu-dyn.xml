      <title>Thermographic study of freezing water drops: An insight on Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the Mpemba Effect challenges scientists, prompting further investigation and refinement of existing hypotheses. This work uses optical tools such as thermography to analyze and study the Mpemba effect on drops. We analyze times and contact angle changes with temperature with an easily controlled experiment. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse surrounding the Mpemba Effect, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and experimental rigor to unravel the complexities of this intriguing phenomenon. A deeper understanding of the Mpemba Effect enhances our knowledge of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics and opens avenues for practical applications in fields such as cryopreservation, meteorology, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Large-scale semi-organized rolls in a sheared convective turbulence: Mean-field simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a mean-field theory of a non-rotating turbulent convection (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 66}, 066305, 2002), we perform mean-field simulations (MFS) of sheared convection which takes into account an effect of modification of the turbulent heat flux by the non-uniform large-scale motions. As the result of this effect, there is an excitation of large-scale convective-shear instability, which causes the formation of large-scale semi-organized structures in the form of rolls. The life-times and spatial scales of these structures are much larger compared to the turbulent scales. By means of MFS performed for stress-free and no-slip vertical boundary conditions, we determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of these structures. Our study demonstrates that the modification of the turbulent heat flux by non-uniform flows leads to a strong reduction of the critical effective Rayleigh number (based on the eddy viscosity and turbulent temperature diffusivity) required for the formation of the large-scale rolls. During the nonlinear stage of the convective-shear instability, there is a transition from the two-layer vertical structure with two roles in the vertical direction before the system reaches steady-state to the one-layer vertical structure with one role after the system reaches steady-state. This effect is observed for all effective Rayleigh numbers. We find that inside the convective rolls, the spatial distribution of the mean potential temperature includes regions with a positive vertical gradient of the potential temperature caused by the mean heat flux of the convective rolls. This study might be useful for understanding of the origin of large-scale rolls observed in atmospheric convective boundary layers as well as in numerical simulations and laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Data-driven computation of adjoint sensitivities without adjoint solvers: An application to thermoacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjoint methods have been the pillar of gradient-based optimization for decades. They enable the accurate computation of a gradient (sensitivity) of a quantity of interest with respect to all system's parameters in one calculation. When the gradient is embedded in an optimization routine, the quantity of interest can be optimized for the system to have the desired behaviour. Adjoint methods require the system's Jacobian, whose computation can be cumbersome, and is problem dependent. We propose a computational strategy to infer the adjoint sensitivities from data (observables), which bypasses the need of the Jacobian of the physical system. The key component of this strategy is an echo state network, which learns the dynamics of nonlinear regimes with varying parameters, and evolves dynamically via a hidden state. Although the framework is general, we focus on thermoacoustics governed by nonlinear and time-delayed systems. First, we show that a parameter-aware Echo State Network (ESN) infers the parameterized dynamics. Second, we derive the adjoint of the ESN to compute the sensitivity of time-averaged cost functionals. Third, we propose the Thermoacoustic Echo State Network (T-ESN), which hard constrains the physical knowledge in the network architecture. Fourth, we apply the framework to a variety of nonlinear thermoacoustic regimes of a prototypical system. We show that the T-ESN accurately infers the correct adjoint sensitivities of the time-averaged acoustic energy with respect to the flame parameters. The results are robust to noisy data, from periodic, through quasiperiodic, to chaotic regimes. A single network predicts the nonlinear bifurcations on unseen scenarios, and so the inferred adjoint sensitivities are employed to suppress an instability via steepest descent. This work opens new possibilities for gradient-based data-driven design optimization.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of energy transfer in strongly driven rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A short, abrupt increase in energy injection rate into steady strongly-driven rotating turbulent flow is used as a probe for energy transfer in the system. The injected excessive energy is localized in time and space and its spectra differ from those of the steady turbulent flow. This allows measuring energy transfer rates, in three different domains: In real space, the injected energy propagates within the turbulent field, as a wave packet of inertial waves. In the frequency domain, energy is transferred non-locally to the low, quasi-geostrophic modes. In wavenumber space, energy locally cascades toward small wavenumbers, in a rate that is consistent with two-dimensionsal (2D) turbulence models. Surprisingly however, the inverse cascade of energy is mediated by inertial waves that propagate within the flow with small, but non-vanishing frequency. Our observations differ from measurements and theoretical predictions of weakly driven turbulence. Yet, they show that in strongly-driven rotating turbulence, inertial waves play an important role in energy transfer, even at the vicinity of the 2D manifold.</description>

      <title>An Invitation to Resolvent Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolvent analysis is a powerful tool that can reveal the linear amplification mechanisms between the forcing inputs and the response outputs about a base flow. These mechanisms can be revealed in terms of a pair of forcing and response modes and the associated gains (amplification magnitude) in the order of energy contents at a given frequency. The linear relationship that ties the forcing and the response is represented through the resolvent operator (transfer function), which is constructed through spatially discretizing the linearized Navier-Stokes operator. One of the unique strengths of resolvent analysis is its ability to analyze statistically stationary turbulent flows. In light of the increasing interest in using resolvent analysis to study a variety of flows, we offer this guide in hopes of removing the hurdle for students and researchers to initiate the development of a resolvent analysis code and its applications to their problems of interest. To achieve this goal, we discuss various aspects of resolvent analysis and its role in identifying dominant flow structures about the base flow. The discussion in this paper revolves around the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the most general manner. We cover essential considerations ranging from selecting the base flow and appropriate energy norms to the intricacies of constructing the linear operator and performing eigenvalue and singular value decompositions. Throughout the paper, we offer details and know-how that may not be available to readers in a collective manner elsewhere. Towards the end of this paper, examples are offered to demonstrate the practical applicability of resolvent analysis, aiming to guide readers through its implementation and inspire further extensions. We invite readers to consider resolvent analysis as a companion for their research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Prolate spheroids settling in a quiescent fluid: clustering, microstructures and collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we investigate the settling of prolate spheroidal particles in a quiescent fluid by means of particle-resolved direct numerical simulations. By varying the particle volume fraction (phi) from 0.1% to 10%, we observe a non-monotonic variation of particle mean settling velocity with a local maximum at phi=1%. To explain this finding, we examine the spatial distribution and orientation of dispersed particles. The particle-pairs statistics show the tendency of particles to form column-like microsturctures, revealing the attraction and entrapment of paritcles in wake regions. This effect results in the formation of large-scale particle clusters at intermediate particle volume fractions. The most intense particle clustering at phi=1%, quantified by the standard deviation of Voronoi volume, induces a swarm effect and substantially enhances the particle settling rate by around 25%. While, in the very dilute suspension at phi=0.1%, the particle clustering is attenuated due to the long inter-particle distance. In dense suspensions, however, the crowded particle arrangement disrupts particle wakes, breaks particle microstructures and inhibits the particle clustering. Consequently, hindrance effect dominates and reduces the settling speed. In contrast to particle spatial distribution, the particle orientation plays a less important role in the mean settling velocity. At last, we examine the collision rate of settling particles by computing the collision kernel. As phi increases, the collision kernel decreases monotonically, which is primarily attributed to the decrease of radial distribution function. However, the radial relative velocity is almost a constant with the change of phi. These results reveal the importance of hydrodynamic interactions, including the wake-flow-induced attractions and the lubrication effect, in collisions among settling spheroids.</description>

      <title>Transport scaling in porous media convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory to describe the Nusselt number ($Nu$), corresponding to the heat or mass flux, as a function of the Rayleigh--Darcy number ($Ra$), the ratio of buoyant driving force over diffusive dissipation, in convective porous media flows. First, we derive exact relationships within the system for the kinetic energy and the thermal dissipation rate. Second, by segregating the thermal dissipation rate into contributions from the boundary layer and the bulk, which is inspired by the ideas of the Grossmann and Lohse theory (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 407, 2000; Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 86, 2001), we derive the scaling relation for $Nu$ as a function of $Ra$ and provide a robust theoretical explanation to the empirical relations proposed in previous studies. Specifically, by incorporating the length scale of the flow structure into the theory, we demonstrate why heat or mass transport differs between two-dimensional and three-dimensional porous media convection. Our model is in excellent agreement with the data obtained from numerical simulations, affirming its validity and predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Robust and Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enhancing Flow Control around a Square Cylinder with Varying Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study applies a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to Active Flow Control (AFC) of a two-dimensional flow around a confined square cylinder. Specifically, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is employed to modulate the flow of a pair of synthetic jets placed on the upper and lower surfaces of the confined squared cylinder in flow configurations characterized by Re of 100, 200, 300, and 400. The investigation starts with an analysis of the baseline flow in the absence of active control. It is observed that at Re = 100 and Re = 200, the vortex shedding exhibits mono-frequency characteristics. Conversely, at Re = 300 and Re = 400, the vortex shedding is dominated by multiple frequencies, which is indicative of more complex flow features. With the application of the SAC algorithm, we demonstrate the capability of DRL-based control in effectively suppressing vortex shedding, while significantly diminishing drag and fluctuations in lift. Quantitatively, the data-driven active control strategy results in a drag reduction of approximately 14.4%, 26.4%, 38.9%, and 47.0% for Re = 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. To understand the underlying control mechanism, we also present detailed flow field comparisons, which showcase the adaptability of DRL in devising distinct control strategies tailored to the dynamic conditions at varying Re. These findings substantiate the proficiency of DRL in controlling chaotic, multi-frequency dominated vortex shedding phenomena, underscoring the robustness of DRL in complex AFC problems.</description>

      <title>Helicity oscillations in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection of liquid metal in a cell with aspect ratio 0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present numerical and experimental results on helicity oscillations in a liquid-metal Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection cell, with an aspect ratio of 0.5. We find that helicity oscillations occur during transitions of flow states that are characterised by significant changes in the Reynolds number. Moreover, we also observe helicity oscillations at flow conditions where the temporal gradient of the change in the Reynolds number is significantly smaller than that of the helicity. Notably, the helicity oscillations observed during the transient double-roll state exhibit characteristics remarkably similar to those associated with the Tayler Instability.</description>

      <title>On the problem of optimal fluid transport in capillaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we revisit the problem of the pressure-driven transport of a meniscus through a narrow cylindrical capillary or pore. This generic process finds many applications in science and technology. As it is known that Direct Numerical Simulations of moving contact line problems are highly demanding in terms of computational costs, simplified models in the form of ordinary differential equations offer an interesting alternative to perform a mathematical optimization of the flow. Blake and De Coninck studied the pressure-driven transport of a meniscus and identified two major competing mechanisms. While a hydrophilic surface is favorable to enhance the spontaneous imbibition into the pore, the friction is known to be significantly reduced on a hydrophobic surface. Blake and De Coninck showed that, depending on the applied pressure difference, there exists an optimal wettability that minimizes the time required to move the meniscus over a certain distance. We revisit this problem and derive analytical solutions in the limiting cases of negligible inertia and negligible contact line friction.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear filtering for a two-layer quasi-geostrophic ocean model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations (2QGE) are a simplified model for the dynamics of a stratified, wind-driven ocean, their numerical simulation is still plagued by the need for high resolution to capture the full spectrum of turbulent scales. Since such high resolution would lead to unreasonable computational times, it is typical to resort to coarse low-resolution meshes combined with the so-called eddy viscosity parameterization to account for the diffusion mechanisms that are not captured due to mesh under-resolution. We propose to enable the use of further coarsened meshes by adding a (linear or nonlinear) differential low-pass to the 2QGE, without changing the eddy viscosity coefficient. While the linear filter introduces constant (additional) artificial viscosity everywhere in the domain, the nonlinear filter relies on an indicator function to determine where and how much artificial viscosity is needed. Through several numerical results for a double-gyre wind forcing benchmark, we show that with the nonlinear filter we obtain accurate results with very coarse meshes, thereby drastically reducing the computational time (speed up ranging from 30 to 300).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study emergent dynamics in a viscous drop subject to interfacial nematic activity. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show how the interplay of nematodynamics, activity-driven flows and surface deformations gives rise to a sequence of self-organized behaviors of increasing complexity, from periodic braiding motions of topological defects to chaotic defect dynamics and active turbulence, along with spontaneous shape changes and translation. Our findings recapitulate qualitative features of experiments and shed light on the mechanisms underpinning morphological dynamics in active interfaces.</description>

      <title>Response of premixed Jet Flames to Blast wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study investigates the response dynamics of premixed jet flames when incident with blast waves along the jet axis. In the present work, blast waves are generated using the wire-explosion technique. The generated blast wave interacts with premixed jet flames that are stabilised over a thin fuel-air jet nozzle. The study is performed over a wide range of parametric space, varying the Reynolds number ($Re$) and normalised equivalence ratio ($\Phi$) of the premixed jet and the strength of the generated blast fronts ($M_{s,r}$). The blast wave imposes a decaying flow field profile characterised by a sharp discontinuity at the blast front. This is accompanied by a subsequent induced flow arising due to entertainment from the surroundings as the blast-imposed flow fields decay to sub-ambient levels. While the jet flame is observed to respond to the blast front with a jittery motion, it is found to lift off following the interaction with the induced flow. Depending on the operating conditions ($Re$, $\Phi$, and $M_{s,r}$), the flame lift-off is followed by an extinction or a re-attachment event. The flame response is further classified into two re-attachment and three extinction sub-regimes based on the response dynamics of the flame base and flame tip following the interaction process. The flame response entails flame base lift-off and flame tip distortion, potentially leading to a flame pinch-off event contingent on the operating conditions. A mathematical model was developed to explain the flame base response dynamics, yielding a scaling law for flame base lift-off height. Flame tip response trends were elucidated by extending the vorticity transport equation to estimate the vortex roll-up rate in the shear boundary surrounding the flame. Flame pinch-off was observed when shear layer vortices reached critical circulation limits and shed at length scales lower than the flame height.</description>

      <title>The energetic inception of breaking in surface gravity waves under wind forcing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The breaking of surface gravity waves is a key process contributing to air-sea fluxes and turbulent ocean mixing. The highly nonlinear nature of wave breaking, combined with the challenges of observing this process in a laboratory or field setting, leaves our understanding of the energetic processes underpinning wave breaking incomplete. Progress towards refining this understanding was made in a recent study (D. G. Boettger et. al., An energetic signature for breaking inception in surface gravity waves, Journal of Fluid Mechanics 959, A33 (2023)), which identified an energetic signature in the wave kinetic energy evolution that preceded breaking onset and correlated with the strength of the breaking event. In this study, we examine the influence of wind forcing on this energetic signature. We develop a numerical wave tank that simulates wind flowing over mechanically generated waves and construct an ensemble of cases with varying wave steepness and wind forcing speed. The wind is shown to modulate the wave geometry and elevate kinetic energy at crest tip by up to 35 %. Despite these influences, the energetic inception signature was found to robustly indicate breaking inception in all cases examined, with a threshold value in the kinetic energy growth rate at this instant separating breaking and non-breaking waves. Under wind forcing, the timing of the energetic inception point occurred slightly earlier that unforced breaking waves, giving advance warning of breaking 0.3 wave periods prior to breaking onset.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parallelization Strategies for Active Flow Control in Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for handling highly dynamic and nonlinear Active Flow Control (AFC) problems. However, the computational cost associated with training DRL models presents a significant performance bottleneck. To address this challenge and enable efficient scaling on high-performance computing architectures, this study focuses on optimizing DRL-based algorithms in parallel settings. We validate an existing state-of-the-art DRL framework used for AFC problems and discuss its efficiency bottlenecks. Subsequently, by deconstructing the overall framework and conducting extensive scalability benchmarks for individual components, we investigate various hybrid parallelization configurations and propose efficient parallelization strategies. Moreover, we refine input/output (I/O) operations in multi-environment DRL training to tackle critical overhead associated with data movement. Finally, we demonstrate the optimized framework for a typical AFC problem where near-linear scaling can be obtained for the overall framework. We achieve a significant boost in parallel efficiency from around 49% to approximately 78%, and the training process is accelerated by approximately 47 times using 60 CPU cores. These findings are expected to provide valuable insights for further advancements in DRL-based AFC studies.</description>

Abstract: The amplification of astrophysical magnetic fields takes place via dynamo instability in turbulent environments. The presence of vorticity is crucial for the dynamo to happen. However, the role of vorticity is not yet fully understood. This work is an extension of previous research on the effect of an irrotational subsonic forcing on a magnetized medium in the presence of rotation or a differential velocity profile, aimed at exploring a wider parameter space in terms of Reynolds numbers, magnetic Prandtl number, forcing scale, cooling timescale in a Newtonian cooling. We study the effect of imposing either the acceleration or the velocity forcing function to be curl-free and evaluate the terms responsible for the evolution vorticity. We use Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) to solve the fully compressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations with the Pencil Code. We study both isothermal and non-isothermal regimes and address the relative importance of different vorticity source terms.We report no small-scale dynamo for the models that do not include shear. We find a hydro instability, followed by a magnetic one, when a shearing velocity profile is applied. The vorticity production is found to be numerical in the purely irrotational case. Non-isothermality, rotation, shear or forcing in the form of a velocity curl-free, when included, contribute to increasing vorticity. Consistently with our previous study, we find that turbulence driven by subsonic expansion waves can amplify vorticity and magnetic field only in the presence of a background shearing profile. The presence of a cooling function make the instability happens on a shorter timescale. We estimate critical Reynolds and Magnetic Reynolds Numbes of 40 and 20, respectively.</description>
