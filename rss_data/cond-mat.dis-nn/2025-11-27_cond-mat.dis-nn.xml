      <title>Local Geometric and Transport Properties of Networks that are Generated from Hyperuniform Point Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller global resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns. These results collectively demonstrate potential advantages of hyperuniformity in network design and motivate further theoretical and experimental exploration of HuPPI networks.</description>

      <title>Discovery and recovery of crystalline materials with property-conditioned transformers</title>

Abstract: Generative models have recently shown great promise for accelerating the design and discovery of new functional materials. Conditional generation enhances this capacity by allowing inverse design, where specific desired properties can be requested during the generation process. However, conditioning of transformer-based approaches, in particular, is constrained by discrete tokenisation schemes and the risk of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. This work introduces CrystaLLM-{\pi} (property injection), a conditional autoregressive framework that integrates continuous property representations directly into the transformer's attention mechanism. Two architectures, Property-Key-Value (PKV) Prefix attention and PKV Residual attention, are presented. These methods bypass inefficient sequence-level tokenisation and preserve foundational knowledge from unsupervised pre-training on Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) as textual input. We establish the efficacy of these mechanisms through systematic robustness studies and evaluate the framework's versatility across two distinct tasks. First, for structure recovery, the model processes high-dimensional, heterogeneous X-ray diffraction patterns, achieving structural accuracy competitive with specialised models and demonstrating applications to experimental structure recovery and polymorph differentiation. Second, for materials discovery, the model is fine-tuned on a specialised photovoltaic dataset to generate novel, stable candidates validated by Density Functional Theory (DFT). It implicitly learns to target optimal band gap regions for high photovoltaic efficiency, demonstrating a capability to map complex structure-property relationships. CrystaLLM-{\pi} provides a unified, flexible, and computationally efficient framework for inverse materials design.</description>

      <title>Acoustic neural networks: Identifying design principles and exploring physical feasibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-guide-based physical systems provide a promising route toward energy-efficient analog computing beyond traditional electronics. Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.</description>

      <title>The 2/3 Rule of Glass Physics Implies Universalities in Crystal Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since more than 100 years, melting is thought to be governed by the Lindemann criterion. It assumes that a crystal melts when, upon heating, the growing atomic vibration amplitudes become sufficiently large to destabilize its crystalline lattice. However, it is unclear why the viscosities eta or the related relaxation times tau of the resulting liquids, measured directly at the melting point Tm, differ by up to nine decades, depending on the material. Based on the empirical rule that the ratio of the glass-transition temperature and Tm is about 2/3, here we show that this strong variation is due to differences in the liquid's fragilities, a property associated with pronounced non-Arrhenius behavior and often ascribed to cooperative motions. We propose that, without cooperativity, all crystals would melt into liquids with a universal viscosity value and relaxation time. Hence, the real melting point is only partly determined by the Lindemann criterion and strongly enhanced by the cooperativity of the resulting liquid. Our findings are corroborated by the determination of the idealized, fragility-free melting temperatures, and of the corresponding eta and tau values for various example materials.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density and Eigenvector Nonorthogonality in Complex Symmetric Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian random matrices with statistical spectral characteristics beyond the standard Ginibre ensembles have recently emerged in the description of dissipative quantum many-body systems as well as in non-ergodic wave transport in complex media. We investigate the class AI$^\dag$ of complex symmetric random matrices, for which available analytic results remain scarce. Using a recently proposed framework by one of the authors, we analyze this class for Gaussian entries and derive an explicit, closed-form expression for the joint distribution of a complex eigenvalue and its right eigenvector for arbitrary matrix size $N\ge 2$ in the entire complex plane. From this, we obtain the distribution of the eigenvector non-orthogonality overlap and the mean eigenvalue density, both for finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit. Notably, at the spectral edge both the eigenvalue density and eigenvector statistics exhibits a limiting behavior that differs from the Ginibre universtality class. This behavior is expected to be universal, as further supported by numerical evidence for Bernoulli random matrices.</description>

      <title>Edge-Dependent Superconductivity in Twisted Bismuth Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers offer a compelling and, at times, confounding platform for the engineering of new twistronic materials. Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in high-dimensional graphs induced by correlated radial disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of models containing robust and analytically demonstrable multifractality induced by disorder correlations. Specifically, we investigate the statistics of eigenstates of disordered tight-binding models on two classes of rooted, high-dimensional graphs -- trees and hypercubes -- with a form of strong disorder correlations we term `radial disorder'. In this model, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical, while those at different distances are independent random variables (or their analogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is also considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are used to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal states. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse participation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad. This leads to a qualitative difference in scaling with system size between the mean and typical IPRs, with the latter the appropriate quantity to characterise the multifractality. The existence of this multifractality is shown to be underpinned by an emergent fragmentation of the graphs into effective one-dimensional chains, which themselves exhibit conventional Anderson localisation. The interplay between the exponential localisation of states on these chains, and the exponential growth of the number of sites with distance from the root, is the origin of the observed multifractality.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group Approach for Signal Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review paper uses renormalization group techniques for signal detection in nearly-continuous positive spectra. We highlight universal aspects of the analogue field-theory approach. The first aim is to present an extended self-consistent construction of the analogue effective field-theory framework for data, which can be viewed as a maximum entropy model. In particular and exploiting universality arguments, we justify the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry of the classical action and we stress the existence of a large-scale (local) regime and of a small-scale (nonlocal) regime. Secondly and related to noise models, we observe the universal relation between phase transition and symmetry breaking in the vicinity of the detection threshold. Finally, we discuss the issue of defining the covariance matrix for tensorial-like data. Based on the cutting graph prescription, we note the superiority of definitions based on complete graphs of large size for data analysis.</description>

      <title>Transition Graphs of Interacting Hysterons: Structure, Design, Organization and Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition graphs capture the memory and sequential response of multistable media, by specifying their evolution under external driving. Microscopically, collections of bistable elements, or hysterons, provide a powerful model for these materials, with recent work highlighting the crucial role of hysteron interactions. Here, we introduce a general framework that links transition graphs and the microscopic parameters of interacting hysterons. We first introduce a systematic framework, based on so-called scaffolds, which structures the space of transition graphs and provides tools to deal with their combinatorial explosion. We then connect the topology of transition graphs to partial orders of the microscopic parameters. This allows us to understand the statistical properties of transition graphs, as well as determine whether a given graph is realizable, i.e. compatible with the hysteron framework. Our approach paves the way for a deeper theoretical understanding of memory effects in complex media and opens a route to rationally design pathways and memory effects in materials.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems: Nonstabilizerness, entanglement, and fractal dimension in SYK and random matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>
