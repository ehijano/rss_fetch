      <title>Foundation Models for Geophysics: Reviews and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large models, or foundation models have demonstrated outstanding performance and have been applied in a variety of disciplines, such as chemistry, biology, economics, etc. Foundation models, trained on vast amounts of data, can be adapted to a wide range of use cases. The emergence of foundation models has a significant impact on the research paradigms in these fields. Geophysics is a scientific field dedicated to exploring and understanding the Earth's structures and states through the application of physical principles and the analysis of multimodal geophysical data. In the field of geophysics, the processing and interpretation of geophysical data are characterized by three primary features: extensive data volume, multimodality, and dependence on experience. These characteristics provide a suitable environment as well as challenges for the development and breakthrough of foundation models in the field of geophysics. In this perspective, we discuss the potential applications and research directions of geophysical foundation models (GeoFMs), exploring new research paradigms in geophysics in the era of foundation models. Exploration geophysics is the main focus, while the development of foundation models in remote sensing, seismology, and other related sub-disciplines in geophysics is also discussed. In the meantime, we also propose two strategies for constructing GeoFMs and discuss challenges that may arise during the process of development.</description>

      <title>A multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for rock-ice avalanche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel physically-based multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for rock-ice avalanche. The model is built on a multi-phase mass flow model and extends a two-phase rock-ice avalanche model. It considers rock, ice and fluid; includes the mechanism of ice-melting and a rigorously derived dynamically changing general temperature equation for avalanching bulk mass, the first of its kind. It explains advection-diffusion of heat including the heat exchange across the rock-ice avalanche body, basal heat conduction, production and loss of heat due to frictional shearing and changing temperature, a general formulation of the ice melting rate and enhancement of temperature due to basal entrainment. The temperature equation includes a composite term containing coupled dynamics: rate of change of thermal conductivity and temperature. Ice melt intensity determines these rates as mixture conductivity evolves, characterizing distinctive thermo-mechanical processes. The model highlights essential aspects of rock-ice avalanches. Lateral heat productions play an important role in temperature evolution. Fast moving avalanches produce higher amount of heat. Fast ice melting results in substantial change in temperature. We formally derive the melting efficiency dependent general fluid production rate. The model includes internal mass and momentum exchanges between the phases and mass and momentum productions due to entrainment. The latter significantly changes the state of temperature; yet, the former exclusively characterizes rock-ice avalanche. Temperature changes are rapid when heat entrainment across the avalanche boundary is substantial. It also applies to basal heat conduction. A strong coupling exists between phase mass and momentum balances and the temperature equation. The new model offers the first-ever complete dynamical solution for simulating rock-ice avalanche with changing temperature.</description>
