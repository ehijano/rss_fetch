      <title>High-precision direct decay energy measurements of the electron-capture decay of $^{97}$Tc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct measurement of the ground-state-to-ground-state electron-capture decay $Q$ ($Q_{\rm EC}$) value of $^{97}$Tc has been conducted employing the high resolving power phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique with the double Penning trap mass spectrometer JYFLTRAP. The resulting $Q_{\rm EC}$ value for $^{97}$Tc is 324.82(21) keV, exhibiting a precision approximately 19 times higher than the value adopted in the newest Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020) and differing by 1.2$\sigma$. Furthermore, by combining this refined $Q$ value with nuclear energy-level data for the decay-daughter $^{97}$Mo, a potential ultra-low Q-value transition, possibly of allowed type, $^{97}$Tc (9/2$^{+}$, ground state) $\rightarrow$ $^{97}$Mo$^{*}$ (320(1) keV), was evaluated for future long-term neutrino-mass determination experiments. The ground-state-to-excited-state electron-capture decay $Q$ value ($Q^{*}_{\rm EC}$) of this transition was determined to be 4.8(10) keV, confirming it to be energetically allowed with a confidence level of exceeding 4$\sigma$. The captures of electrons occupying the L and higher shells for this transition are energetically allowed, giving a value of 2.0(10) keV for the closest distance of $Q^{*}_{\rm EC}$ to the allowed binding energy of the L1 shell. To predict partial half-lives and energy-release distributions for this transition, the atomic self-consistent many-electron Dirac--Hartree--Fock--Slater method and the nuclear shell model have been employed. Dominant correction terms such as exchange and overlap corrections, as well as shake-up and shake-off effects, were included in the final results. Moreover, the normalized distribution of released energy in the electron-capture decay of $^{97}$Tc to excited states of $^{97}$Mo, is compared with that of $^{163}$Ho, which is being used for electron-neutrino-mass determination.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effects of QCD matter's electrical conductivity on charge dependent directed flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge dependent directed flow is an important observable of electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate how the difference in charge dependent directed flows between protons and antiprotons is sensitive to the resistivity, inverse of quark-gluon plasma's electric conductivity, over different collision centralities. Our model numerically solves the 3+1D relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamic (RRMHD) equations, assuming the electric conductivity to be a scalar. For this work, we focus on symmetric Au + Au collisions at the top RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. We illustrate the time evolution of the electromagnetic fields in our model and connect that to the charge dependent directed flow results. Our results highlight the importance of modeling quark-gluon plasma's electric conductivity for charge dependent observables in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing properties of nuclear spin-orbit interaction with nucleon spin polarization in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleon spin polarization perpendicular to the reaction plane ($P_y$) and along the beam direction ($P_z$) in Au+Au collisions at the beam energy of 100A MeV with different nuclear spin-orbit interactions has been studied based on a spin- and isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (SIBUU) transport model. While the spin polarization is weaker with a weaker nuclear spin-orbit coupling as intuitively expected, a density-dependent nuclear spin-orbit coupling enhances the $P_y$ at large rapidities and leads to a less negative or large $P_y$ at high transverse momenta. The difference in the $P_y$ of free neutrons and protons at midrapidities and at small transverse momenta is sensitive to the isospin dependence of the nuclear spin-orbit interaction. While the $P_z$ is also affected by the properties of nuclear spin-orbit interaction in some sense, the behavior of the $P_y$ serves as a good probe of the strength, density dependence, and isospin dependence of nuclear spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our contribution aims to celebrate the immeasurable contribution that Tom Kuo has provided to the understanding of the structure of atomic nuclei, and also of the infinite nuclear matter, in terms of the fundamental principles governing the realistic nuclear potential. The authors want to testify Tom Kuo's heritage and impact on their approach to the study of nuclear systems by reviewing some recent findings on the role of the two-body component of shell-model effective $\beta$-decay operators. The focus is spotted on the so-called Pauli-blocking effect, that plays a non-negligible role in nuclei characterized by a large number of valence nucleons.</description>

      <title>Integration Concept of the CBM Micro Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Micro Vertex Detector (MVD) is the most upstream detector of the fixed-target Compressed Baryonic Matter Experiment (CBM) at the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). It enables high-precision low-momentum tracking in direct proximity of the target. Reaching the stringent requirements for the MVD, a material budget of~$0.3\,-\,0.5\%\,X_0$ per layer, operating the dedicated CMOS MAPS~(`MIMOSIS') in the target vacuum, the strong magnetic dipole field, and a harsh radiation environment~(5\,Mrad, $7\times10^{13}\,n_{\text{eq}}/\text{cm}^2$ per CBM year), poses an unprecedented integration challenge. In this paper, the integration concept of the detector is be outlined, elaborating on the selection and preparation of materials, assembly procedures, and quality assessment steps in the ongoing preparation of pre-series production and detector commissioning in 2028.</description>

      <title>Calibration of a $\Delta$E-E telescope based on CeBr$_3$ scintillator for secondary charged particles measurements in hadron therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadrontherapy is a promising cancer treatment method that offers better dose conformity and reduces damage to healthy tissues compared to conventional radiotherapy. However, one major challenge remaining is the precise characterization of secondary particles generated by nuclear interactions of the primary beam with tissues. Current data on secondary charged particles, such as protons and light ions, remain insufficient, particularly in the clinically relevant energy ranges. This lack of experimental data introduces uncertainties in treatment planning softwares and Monte Carlo calculations, thus compromising the accuracy of dose delivery to the patients. This work consists in the characterization of secondary charged particles generated in hadron therapy using a $\Delta$E-E telescope comprising a CeBr$_3$ crystal scintillator and a plastic scintillator. The calibration and response of this telescope to ions commonly used in clinical settings is presented in this work, highlighting adherence to Birks law for accurate energy measurements. This study is the first to optimize a $\Delta$E-E telescope combining CeBr$_3$ and plastic scintillators specifically for secondary particle detection in hadrontherapy. This represents an important step in the exploitation of the system for nuclear data acquisition, as it enables both the measurement of energy and the discrimination of secondary particles. The objective is to develop a system compatible with clinical use, allowing for the most precise possible comparison with treatment planning software calculations.</description>

      <title>Collision energy dependence in heavy ion collisions from nonlinear QCD evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the effects of including the energy dependence determined from evolution equations within the color glass condensate framework on observables in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. This amounts to integrating the JIMWLK evolution equations into the IP-Glasma model, which is then coupled to viscous relativistic hydrodynamics. This methodology allows for a systematic representation of nuclei at specific Bjorken-$x$ values, which are probed at different center-of-mass energies of the collision and rapidities of final state particles. Comparing to the conventional IP-Glasma model, we find significant effects on multiplicity distributions and particle spectra, especially in smaller collision systems at the highest center of mass energies. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating nonlinear QCD evolution in the description of heavy ion collisions at varying center of mass energies, as the precise extraction of transport coefficients will be affected. This work establishes a robust framework for understanding the quark gluon plasma and nuclear structure at high energy, integrating small-$x$ physics into the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Search for Double Beta Decay of $^{136}$Xe to the $0^+_1$ Excited State of $^{136}$Ba with PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a search of double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe to the excited state, $0^+_1$, of $^{136}$Ba (2$\nu \beta \beta$-0$_1^+$), using the dual-phase xenon detector of PandaX-4T with the first 94.9-day commissioning data. The multi-site events are reconstructed up to the MeV energy scale, which helps to improve the background model significantly. The background contribution from the stainless steel platform outside PandaX-4T cryostat is evaluated for the first time. No significant evidence for 2$\nu \beta \beta$-0$_1^+$ is observed, resulting in a lower limit of $T_{1/2}^{2 \nu \beta \beta-0_1^+} &gt; 7.5 \times 10^{22}$ yr at the 90% confidence level. This is the first experimental limit on such a rare decay in a natural xenon-based detector.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole-hexadecapole correlations in neutron-rich samarium and gadolinium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extensive study of quadrupole-hexadecapole correlation effects in even-even Sm and Gd isotopes with neutron number $N=88-106$. The calculations are performed in the framework of the Gogny energy density functional (EDF) with the D1S parametrization and the $sdg$ interacting boson model (IBM). The quadrupole-hexadecapole constrained self-consistent mean-field potential energy surface is mapped onto the expectation value of the $sdg$-boson Hamiltonian. This procedure determines the parameters of the $sdg$-IBM Hamiltonian microscopically. Calculated excitation energies and transition strengths are compared to the ones obtained with a simpler $sd$-IBM, as well as with the experimental data. The Gogny-EDF mapped $sdg$-IBM reproduces spectroscopic properties of the studied nuclei as reasonably as in the case of the previous $sdg$-boson mapping calculations that were based on the relativistic EDF, indicating that the axial quadrupole-hexadecapole method is sound regardless of whether relativistic or nonrelativistic EDF is employed. The mapped $sdg$-IBM improves some of the results in lighter Sm and Gd isotopes compared to the mapped $sd$-IBM, implying the existence of significant hexadecapole correlations in those nuclei. For those nuclei with $N \geq 94$, hexadecapole effects are minor, and the only significant difference between the two boson models can be found in the description of $E0$ monopole transitions.</description>

      <title>Exploring $ \Lambda{\text-} $ and $ \Xi{\text -}$triton correlation functions in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $ \Lambda{\text -} $ and $ \Xi{\text -}$triton(t) momentum correlation functions, to be measured in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, are explored.
  Mainly, STAR detector acquired data provides an opportunity to explore the $ \Lambda t $ correlation function.
  The $ \Lambda t $ correlation functions are calculated using
  an isle-type and spin-averaged $ \Lambda t $ potential,
  also, its sensitivity to changes in potential strength has also been investigated.
  %
  Besides, even though there is no experimental data on the $ \Xi{\text -} $triton interaction yet,
  I constructed $\Xi t$ potentials based on the first principles HAL QCD and Nijmegen extended soft-core (ESC08c) model of spin- and isospin averaged $\Xi N$ interactions in single-folding potentials (SFP) approach. 
  Then, the $\Xi t$ correlation functions are calculated for these two modern potentials as well as for Nijmegen hard-core model D (NHC-D) $\Xi N$ potential.
  The numerical results predict that, with good measurement resolution, it might be possible to recognize different potentials with a correlation function at relatively small source sizes, i.e., $ R = 1-3 $ fm.</description>
