      <title>Possibilities and challenges of STEAM pedagogies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the integration of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) into education, emphasizing the inclusion of the Arts to foster creativity alongside traditional STEM skills. STEAM encourages multidisciplinary, student-centered approaches like project-based and inquiry-based learning, promoting real-world problem-solving. However, significant challenges arise in implementing STEAM, particularly for teachers who often lack interdisciplinary training and face rigid school structures. Assessing STEAM outcomes also remains complex. The paper highlights the need for reforms in teacher education to support interdisciplinary teaching, along with addressing "disciplinary egocentrism" in higher education. Despite these challenges, STEAM has shown promise in enhancing student engagement, creativity, and critical thinking. To unlock its full potential, systemic changes in curriculum design, educational practices, and teacher training are essential.</description>

      <title>A graduate laboratory experiment to set up a photon-counting detector using MKIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new laboratory activity aimed at developing knowledge and expertise in microwave applications at cryogenic temperatures. The experience focuses on the detection of infrared photons through Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs). The experimental setup, theoretical concepts, and activities involved are detailed, highlighting the skills and knowledge gained through the experience. This experiment is designed for graduate students in the field of quantum technologies.</description>
