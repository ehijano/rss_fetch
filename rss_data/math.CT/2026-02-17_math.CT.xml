      <title>On the zero-classes of monoid semi-congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the zero-classes of monoid semi-congruences, understood as internal reflexive relations on a monoid. Classical examples include normal submonoids, which arise as zero-classes of congruences, and positive cones, which are the zero-classes of preorders; both admit well-known syntactic characterizations via the Eilenberg syntactic equivalence and the syntactic preorder introduced by Pin, respectively. Beyond these cases, however, no general notion of a syntactic object characterizing zero-classes of semi-congruences, also called clots, has been established.
  We address this gap by introducing a syntactic relation that is reflexive and characterizes clots whenever it is compatible with the monoid operation, a property that is not automatic in contrast to the congruence and preorder settings. We further develop a hierarchy of conditions on submonoids of a given monoid that induce syntactic relations with progressively stronger properties: first ensuring compatibility with the monoid operation, and subsequently enforcing additional relational properties such as transitivity and symmetry. Several illustrative situations are discussed, including the cases of positive cones and normal submonoids.</description>

      <title>$2$-dimensional Lawvere theories: commutativity and lax phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study categorified algebraic structures and their pseudo- and lax homomorphisms using the framework of Lawvere $2$-theories, and more generally, (enhanced) $2$-dimensional sketches. The key notion we focus on is that of $2$-dimensional commutativity. As one of the main results, we prove that if a Lawvere $2$-theory $\mathbb{T}$ is equipped with such a structure, then the $2$-category $\mathsf{Mod}_l(\mathbb{T},\mathbf{Cat})$ of $\mathbb{T}$-models, lax homomorphisms, and modifications admits a natural structure of a closed $2$-multicategory. From this, we deduce a generalization of Fox's theorem. We also discuss the analogue in the higher setting for Lawvere $(\infty,2)$-theories. As a result of independent interest, we construct a multicategory (or $\infty$-operad) structure on the hom-category $\mathsf{Hom}_{\mathbb{V}}(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N})$, where $\mathbb{V}$ is a monoidal $(\infty,2)$-category and $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$ are monoids therein.</description>

      <title>The higher algebra and geometry of monoidal bicategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that braided, sylleptic and symmetric monoidal bicategories are precisely the $\mathsf{E}_k$-monoids in the cartesian monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category of bicategories for respective integers $k$. To manage the underlying computations, we use the geometry of the little cubes operads to mediate between the 2-dimensional algebra underlying the former and the $\infty$-categorical algebra underlying the latter.</description>

      <title>Can a Lightweight Automated AI Pipeline Solve Research-Level Mathematical Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in generating rigorous mathematical proofs, with "AI for Math" emerging as a vibrant field of research. While these models have mastered competition-level benchmarks like the International Mathematical Olympiad and show promise in research applications through auto-formalization, their deployment via lightweight, natural-language pipelines for research problems remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that next-generation models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2 Pro), when integrated into a streamlined automated pipeline optimized for citation-based verification, can solve sophisticated research-grade problems. We evaluate our pipeline on two novel datasets: (1) the ICCM problem sets (comparable to the S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest) proposed by leading mathematicians, and (2) the "First Proof" problem set, consisting of previously unpublished research questions. Our pipeline generated candidate proofs for all problems in the first two ICCM sets and the "First Proof" set. The solutions for the first two ICCM sets and Problem 4 of the "First Proof" set have been fully verified by our team. All generated proofs have been submitted to the official organization, and our generated results are publicly available. We plan to open-source the complete pipeline methodology in due course.</description>

      <title>Similarity Algebra: A Framework for Approximate Algebraic and Lie Structures with Collapse to Classical Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical algebraic structures require exact satisfaction of their defining axioms. We propose similarity algebra, a framework extending algebraic and Lie structures to settings where operations satisfy quantitative bounds up to a tolerance $\varepsilon$. Instead of strict associativity, inverses, or distributivity, we study families of operations controlled by explicit $\varepsilon$-estimates and analyze their behavior under limit collapse.
  Under uniform error control and $C^1_{\mathrm{loc}}$ convergence of the structure maps, we prove a general collapse theorem showing that similarity structures converge to classical algebraic objects, as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. We develop a hierarchy of approximate structures, including similarity groups, rings, fields, vector spaces, and Lie groups, formalized through axioms satisfied within metric distance $\varepsilon$. We further define a category of similarity algebras governing morphisms between approximate systems. Moreover, we clarify the relationship between similarity algebra and fuzzy algebra, showing that the former generalizes the latter. The proposed similarity algebra can be useful to model real-world phenomena where operations or relations are inherently approximate.</description>

      <title>A Unified Mathematical Framework for Distributed Data Fabrics: Categorical Hypergraph Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current distributed data fabrics lack a rigorous mathematical foundation, often relying on ad-hoc architectures that struggle with consistency, lineage, and scale. We propose a mathematical framework for data fabrics, unifying heterogeneous data management in distributed systems through a hypergraph-based structure \( \mathcal{F} = (D, M, G, T, P, A) \). Datasets, metadata, transformations, policies, and analytics are modeled over a distributed system \( \Sigma = (N, C) \), with multi-way relationships encoded in a hypergraph \( G = (V, E) \). A categorical approach, with datasets as objects and transformations as morphisms, supports operations like data integration and federated learning. The hypergraph is embedded into a modular tensor category, capturing relational symmetries via braided monoidal structures, with geometric analogies to Hurwitz spaces enriching the algebraic modeling. We prove the NP-hardness of critical tasks, such as schema matching and dynamic partitioning, and propose spectral methods and symmetry-based alignments for scalable solutions. The framework ensures consistency, completeness, and causality under CAP and CAL theorems, leveraging sparse incidence matrices and braiding actions for fault-tolerant operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a criterion for determining when a family of geometric functors is jointly conservative through the lens of purity in compactly generated triangulated categories. We introduce the notion of pure descendability and we apply it to two particular situations involving sequential limits of ring spectra.</description>

Abstract: We introduce partial Markov categories as a synthetic framework for synthetic probabilistic inference, blending the work of Cho and Jacobs, Fritz, and Golubtsov on Markov categories with the work of Cockett and Lack on cartesian restriction categories. We describe observations, Bayes' theorem, normalisation, and both Pearl's and Jeffrey's updates in purely categorical terms.</description>

      <title>Bicategories of Lax Fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known calculus of fractions of Gabriel and Zisman provides a convenient way to formally invert morphisms in a category. This was generalised to bicategories by Pronk. We extend these constructions by presenting a calculus of lax fractions for 2-categories that formally turns given morphisms into left adjoint right inverses and given pseudo-commutative squares into Beck-Chevalley squares.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof of the statement that if an idempotent complete preadditive category has weak kernels and weak cokernels, then it has $n$-kernels if and only if it has $n$-cokernels, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. As a consequence, elementary proofs of two results concerning the equality between the global dimensions of certain right and left module categories are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Serre subcategory $\mathscr L$ and a resolving subcategory $\mathscr A$ of an abelian category, we show that the derived equivalence $D^b(\overline{\mathscr A} \cap \mathscr L) \simeq D^b_{\mathscr L}(\mathscr A)$ holds under certain conditions. We apply this to obtain derived equivalences in the contexts of chain complexes of graded modules or coherent sheaves, with finite $\mathscr A$-dimension, supported on closed sets having eventually finite $\mathscr A$-dimension. Using this, we obtain descriptions of the homotopy fibers in (hermitian) K theory of the restriction maps to certain open sets.</description>

      <title>Categorical structure in coherent theory of arithmetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a semantic and syntactic analysis of parametrised natural numbers object in coherent categories, or pr-coherent categories. Semantically, we show the definable functions in the initial pr-coherent category are exactly given by primitive recursive functions. We also show that any pr-coherent category supports the construction of bounded universal quantifications, which are absent in an arbitrary coherent category. Under these semantic consideration, we construct a coherent theory of arithmetic and we show its syntactic category is equivalent to the initial pr-coherent category. From a logical perspective, we also show that this theory can be identified as the {\Sigma}1-fragment of I{\Sigma}1. Thus as an application, we provide a structural proof of the classical result in proof theory that the strongly {\Sigma}1-representable functions in I{\Sigma}1 are exactly primitive recursive functions.</description>

      <title>Comparing dg category models for path spaces via $A_\infty$-functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a many-object dual version of Chen's iterated integral map. For any topological space X, the construction takes the form of an A-infinity functor between two dg categories whose objects are the points of X: the domain has as morphisms the singular (cubical) chains on the space of (Moore) paths in X and the codomain has morphisms arising by totalizing a cosimplicial chain complex determined by the dg coalgebra of singular (simplicial) chains in X. When X is simply connected, we show this construction defines a homotopy inverse to a classical map of Adams, which sends ordered sequences of singular simplices in X linked by shared vertices to cubes of paths in X. When X is not necessarily simply connected, following an idea of Irie, we incorporate the fundamental groupoid of X into the construction and deduce analogous results. Along the way, we provide an elementary and new proof of the fact that the (direct-sum) cobar construction of the chains in X, suitably interpreted, models the dg category of paths in X, an extension of Adams's cobar theorem established by Rivera-Zeinalian using different methods.</description>
