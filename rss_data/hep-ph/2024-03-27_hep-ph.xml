      <title>Exclusive Bremsstrahlung of One and Two Photons in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the diffractive bremsstrahlung of a single photon in the $pp \to pp \gamma$ reaction at LHC energies and at forward photon rapidities. We compare the results for our standard approach, based on QFT and the tensor-Pomeron model, with two versions of soft-photon approximations, SPA1 and SPA2, where the radiative amplitudes contain only the leading terms proportional to $\omega^{-1}$ (the inverse of the photon energy). SPA1, which does not have the correct energy-momentum relations, performs surprisingly well in the kinematic range considered, namely at very forward photon rapidities and $0.02 &lt; \xi_{1,2} &lt; 0.1$, the relative energy loss of the protons, corresponding to small values of the photon transverse momentum. Azimuthal correlations between outgoing particles are presented. We discuss also the role of the $p p \to p p \pi^0$ background for single photon production. We discuss also the possibility of a measurement of the $pp \to pp \gamma \gamma$ reaction. Our predictions can be verified by ATLAS-LHCf combined experiments.</description>

      <title>Can CP be conserved in the two-Higgs-doublet model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conditions under which the CP violation in the quark mixing matrix can leak into the scalar potential of the real two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) via divergent radiative corrections, thereby spoiling the renormalizability of the model. We show that any contributing diagram must involve 12 Yukawa-coupling insertions and a factor of the $U(1)_{PQ}$-breaking scalar potential parameter $\lambda_5$, thereby requiring at least six loops; this also implies that the 2HDM with only softly-broken $U(1)_{PQ}$ is safe from divergent leaks of CP violation to all orders. We demonstrate that additional symmetries of the six-loop diagrams in the type I and II 2HDMs guarantee that all of the divergent CP-violating contributions cancel at this order. We also show that these symmetries are violated at seven loops and enumerate the classes of diagrams that can contribute to CP-violating divergences, providing evidence that the real 2HDM is theoretically inconsistent starting at the seven-loop level.</description>

      <title>Missing Energy plus Jet in the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of dineutrinos in proton-proton collisions, with large missing transverse energy and an energetic jet as the experimental signature. Recasting a search from the ATLAS collaboration we work out constraints on semileptonic four-fermion operators, gluon and electroweak dipole operators and $Z$-penguins in the SMEFT. All but the $Z$-penguin operators experience energy-enhancement. Constraints on gluon dipole operators are the strongest, probing new physics up to 14 TeV, and improve over existing ones from collider studies. Limits on FCNC four-fermion operators are competitive with Drell-Yan production of dileptons, and improve on those for tau final states. For left-handed $|\Delta s|=|\Delta d|=1$ and right-handed $|\Delta c|=|\Delta u|=1$ transitions these are the best available limits, also considering rare kaon and charm decays. We estimate improvements for the $3000 \;\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Majorana Neutrinos and Dark Matter from Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a simple theory for neutrino masses where the total lepton number is a local gauge symmetry spontaneously broken below the multi-TeV scale. In this context, the neutrino masses are generated through the canonical seesaw mechanism and a Majorana dark matter candidate is predicted from anomaly cancellation. We discuss in great detail the dark matter annihilation channels and find out the upper bound on the symmetry breaking scale using the cosmological bounds on the relic density. Since in this context the dark matter candidate has suppressed couplings to the Standard Model quarks, one can satisfy the direct detection bounds even if the dark matter mass is close to the electroweak scale. This theory predicts a light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (the Majoron) associated to the mechanism of neutrino mass. We discuss briefly the properties of the Majoron and the impact of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis bounds.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of vacuum pair production in uniform electric fields revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of electron-positron pair production from vacuum in the presence of a uniform time-dependent electric field of arbitrary polarization. Taking into account the interaction with the external classical background in a nonperturbative manner, we quantize the electron-positron field and derive a system of ten quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) showing that the previously-used QKEs are incorrect once the external field rotates in space. We employ then the Wigner-function formalism of the field quantization and establish a direct connection between the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) approach to investigating the vacuum pair-production process and the QKEs. We provide a self-contained description of the two theoretical frameworks rigorously proving their equivalence and present an exact one-to-one correspondence between the kinetic functions involved within the two techniques. Special focus is placed on the analysis of the spin effects in the final particle distributions.</description>

      <title>The role of the Look Elsewhere Effect in determining the significance of an oscillation disappearance search for a light sterile neutrino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ongoing vibrant experimental quest to assess whether the numerous indications for a light sterile neutrino are only experimental fluctuations or the manifestations of a profound and real underlying effect, one aspect which has recently attracted a specific interest is the statistical treatment of the data. Especially in cases of supposed positive hints, the correct statistical assessment of their significance is of paramount importance, to avoid that potential overstatements lead to a wrong understanding of the real status of the experimental investigation in the field. In this work I show how latest crucial advancements in the statistical data processing for the interpretation of the output of a sterile search can be effectively put and understood in the context of the Look Elsewhere Effect phenomenon, developed and now of routine usage for results interpretation in other areas of HEP research.</description>

      <title>The flavor structures on magnetized orbifold models and 4D modular symmetric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quark and lepton flavor structures on magnetized $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ twisted orbifold model. There are 6,460 number of flavor models but most of them cannot lead to realistic flavor observables because of the difficulties on realizing mass hierarchies and small (large) mixing angles of quarks (leptons). We find that certain zero point patterns of zero-modes of fermions and Higgs fields give the flavor models being able to avoid these difficulties. We classify such flavor models and show numerical example.
  Next we study four-dimensional (4D) modular symmetric quark flavor models without fine-tuning. Mass matrices become hierarchical as close to the modular symmetric points depending on its residual charges. Actually the residual $Z_N$ symmetries with $N\geq 6$ can originate the large quark mass hierarchies. Also the products of residual symmetries such as $Z_3\times Z_3\times Z_3$ have such possibility. We study the quark flavor model with $\Gamma_6$ symmetry and $A_4\times A_4\times A_4$ symmetry. We assume the vicinity of the cusp $\tau=i\infty$ where residual $Z_6$ and $Z_3\times Z_3\times Z_3$ symmetry remain. Consequently we find the models realizing the order of the quark mass ratios and the absolute values of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements without fine-tuning.
  Finally we construct the Siegel modular forms. Zero-modes on $T^6$ at $\vec{z}=0$ are the Siegel modular forms of weight 1/2 for the subgroup of $Sp(6,\mathbb{Z})$. They have several moduli parameters and therefore have the possibility realizing the flavor structures including the CP phases. We study the Siegel modular forms transformed by $\widetilde{\Delta}(96)$ and show numerical example. We find one of moduli parameters $\omega_1$ works on the large mass hierarchies and $\omega_2$ works on the CP violation successfully in our model.</description>

      <title>Inclusive and diffractive dijet photoproduction in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we summarize NLO pQCD predictions for inclusive and diffractive dijet photoproduction in Pb-Pb UPCs at the LHC. We demonstrate that the theory describes well the preliminary ATLAS data on the inclusive cross section, which probes nuclear parton distributions (PDFs) down to $x_A \approx 0.005$ and which can reduce current uncertainties of the small-$x$ nuclear gluon distribution by approximately a factor of 2. Employing predictions of the leading twist approach to nuclear shadowing for nuclear diffractive PDFs, we calculate the cross section of diffractive dijet photoproduction and show that its $x_{\gamma}$ dependence is sensitive to the effect of nuclear shadowing and the mechanism of QCD factorization breaking in hard diffraction. We also find that due to large leading twist nuclear shadowing and restricted kinematics, the diffractive contribution to the inclusive cross section of dijet photoproduction does not exceed $5-10$%, which helps with an ambiguous interpretation of the ATLAS data.</description>

      <title>TeV scale Signatures of Lepton Flavour Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The juxtaposition of the precision of lepton flavour measurements and the limited energy range of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to discover dynamical degrees of freedom linked to the generation of the observed lepton mass patterns naively suggests only a limited relevance of the LHC's high luminosity phase. This, potentially, extends to future colliders. We show that minimal non-standard modifications of widely considered scenarios such as the type-II seesaw model can, however, lead to a rich phenomenological interplay of muon precision measurements and electroweak resonance searches at present and future colliders, with testable implications for the HL-LHC phase.</description>

      <title>Dynamical origin of neutrino masses and dark matter from a new confining sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamical mechanism, based on a confining non-abelian dark symmetry, which generates Majorana masses for hypercharge-less fermions, is proposed. We apply it to the inverse seesaw scenario, which allows to generate light neutrino masses from the interplay of TeV-scale Pseudo-Dirac mass terms and a small explicit breaking of lepton number. A single generation of vector-like dark quarks, transforming under a $\text{SU}(3)_\text{D}$ gauge symmetry, is coupled to a real singlet scalar, which serves as a portal between the dark quark condensate and three generations of heavy sterile neutrinos. Such a dark sector and the Standard Model (SM) are kept in thermal equilibrium with each other via sizeable Yukawa couplings to the heavy neutrinos. In this framework the lightest dark baryon, which has spin $3/2$ and is stabilized at the renormalizable level by an accidental dark baryon number symmetry, can account for the observed relic density via thermal freeze-out from annihilations into the lightest dark mesons. These mesons in turn decay to heavy neutrinos, which produce SM final states upon decay. This model may be probed by next generation neutrino telescopes via neutrino lines produced from dark matter annihilations.</description>

      <title>A new method to access heavy meson lightcone distribution amplitudes from first-principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to compute lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of heavy meson within heavy quark effective theory (HQET). Our method utilizes quasi distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) with a large momentum component $P^z$. We point out that by sequentially integrating out $P^z$ and $m_H$, one can disentangle different dynamical scales. Integrating out $P^z$ allows to connect quasi-DAs to QCD LCDAs, and then integrating out $m_H$ enables to relate QCD LCDAs to HQET LCDAs. To verify this proposal, we make use of lattice QCD simulation on a lattice ensemble with spacing $a = 0.05187$\,fm. The preliminary findings for HQET LCDAs qualitatively align with phenomenological models. Using a recent model for HQET LCDAs, we also fit the first inverse moment $\lambda_B^{-1}$ and the result is consistent with the experimentally constrain from $B \to \gamma \ell\nu_\ell$. This agreement demonstrates the promise of our method in providing first-principle predictions for heavy meson LCDAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we present a novel, model-independent description of semileptonic $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays. In addition, we discuss recent developments in the understanding of coupled-channel $D \pi$-$D \eta$-$D_s K$ S-wave scattering and, for the first time, apply them to semileptonic decays. We not only obtain model-independent predictions for kinematic distributions in $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays, but also rule out the hypothesis that the gap between the inclusive $B\rightarrow X\ell\nu$ branching fraction and the sum over exclusive channels is made up predominantly by $B\rightarrow D^{(\ast)} \eta \ell \nu$ decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of dispersive representations of the Omn\`es-Khuri-Treiman-Sawyer-Wali type for the final-state interactions in the amplitudes of the $K\to\pi\pi\pi$ weak transitions is constructed, under the assumptions that CP and isospin symmetries are conserved. Both the $\Delta I = 1/2$ and $\Delta I = 3/2$ transition channels are considered. The set of single-variable functions involved in these representations is identified, and the polynomial ambiguities in their definitions are discussed. Numerical solutions for the system of coupled integral relations satisfied by these functions are provided, and the determination of the subtraction constants in terms of the experimental information on the amplitudes in the decay region is addressed.</description>

Abstract: We re-consider recent measures of $R_{K}$ and $R_{K^*}$, now compatible with the Standard Model expectations, as well as the results for the process $\text{BR}(B_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-)$ alongside earlier determinations of $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ and $\text{BR}(B_c \rightarrow \tau \nu)$. We provide analytic constraints on the associated Wilson coefficients in both the $b \to s$ and the $b \to c$ sectors. These allow us to estimate the scale of potential New Physics for generic extensions of the Standard Model. We then use the results to constrain the leptoquark landscape.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the next-to-leading-power $\gamma\gamma \to h $ and $gg\to h$ soft quark functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate directly in position space the one-loop renormalization kernels of the soft operators $O_\gamma$ and $O_g$ that appear in the soft-quark contributions to, respectively, the subleading-power $\gamma\gamma\to h$ and $gg\to h$ form factors mediated by the $b$-quark. We present an IR/rapidity divergence-free definition for $O_g$ and demonstrate that with a correspondent definition of the collinear function, a consistent factorization theorem is recovered. Using conformal symmetry techniques, we establish a relation between the evolution kernels of the leading-twist heavy-light light-ray operator, whose matrix element defines the $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA), and $O_\gamma$ to all orders in perturbation theory. Application of this relation allows us to bootstrap the kernel of $O_\gamma$ to the two-loop level. We construct an ansatz for the kernel of $O_g$ at higher orders. We test this ansatz against the consistency requirement at two-loop and find they differ only by a particular constant.</description>

      <title>Low-energy elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering in covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy antineutrino- and neutrino-nucleon neutral current elastic scattering is studied within the framework of the relativistic SU(2) baryon chiral perturbation theory up to the order of $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We have derived the model-independent hadronic amplitudes and extracted the form factors from them. It is found that differential cross sections ${{\rm d} \sigma}/{{\rm d} Q^2}$ for the processes of (anti)neutrino-proton scattering are in good agreement with the existing MiniBooNE data in the $Q^2$ region $[0.13,0.20]$ GeV$^2$, where nuclear effects are expected to be negligible. For $Q^2\leq 0.13$ GeV$^2$, large deviation is observed, which is mainly owing to the sizeable Pauli blocking effect. Comparisons with the simulation data produced by the NuWro and GIENE Mento Carlo events generators are also discussed. The chiral results obtained in this work can be utilized as inputs in various nuclear models to achieve the goal of precise determination of the strangeness axial vector form factor, in particular when the low-energy MicroBooNE data are available in the near future.</description>

      <title>Hidden-charm pentaquark states $qqqc\bar{c}$ $(q = u,d)$ in the chiral SU(3) quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically calculate the spectrum of hidden-charm pentaquark states $qqqc\bar{c}$ $(q = u,d)$ in the chiral SU(3) quark model, which has been quite successful in reproducing consistently the energies of octet and decuplet baryon ground states, the binding energy of deuteron, and the nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) scattering phase shifts and mixing parameters for partial waves with total angular momentum up to $J=6$. The Hamiltonian contains the one-gluon-exchange (OGE) potential, the Goldstone-boson-exchange (GBE) potential, the confinement potential, and the kinetic energy of the system. We solve the Schr\"odinger equation by use of the variational method. It is found that the masses of all the experimentally observed $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4380)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$ states are much overestimated, indicating that these states are not compact pentaquark states in the chiral SU(3) quark model. All other $qqqc\bar{c}$ $(q = u,d)$ states are found to lie much above the corresponding baryon-meson thresholds, and thus are not suggested as stable pentaquark states due to their fall-apart decays. A detailed comparison of the results with those obtained in the OGE model and the chromomagnetic interaction (CMI) model is further given.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions through two avenues: high-$p_{\perp}$ frameworks and hydrodynamic modeling. Using the T$_{\text{R}}$ENTo model, we find that IP-Glasma mimicking $p=0$ value aligns well with high-$p_{\perp}$ data, in agreement with Bayesian analysis of the low-$p_{\perp}$ regime. While adjusting $p$ values may improve a fit to a particular high-$p_{\perp}$ observable, it does not permit an earlier onset of transverse expansion.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of the $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ Interaction Cross Sections at the LHC with FASER's Emulsion Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first results of the study of high-energy electron and muon neutrino charged-current interactions in the FASER$\nu$ emulsion/tungsten detector of the FASER experiment at the LHC. A subset of the FASER$\nu$ volume, which corresponds to a target mass of 128.6~kg, was exposed to neutrinos from the LHC $pp$ collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of 13.6~TeV and an integrated luminosity of 9.5 fb$^{-1}$. Applying stringent selections requiring electrons with reconstructed energy above 200~GeV, four electron neutrino interaction candidate events are observed with an expected background of $0.025^{+0.015}_{-0.010}$, leading to a statistical significance of 5.2$\sigma$. This is the first direct observation of electron neutrino interactions at a particle collider. Eight muon neutrino interaction candidate events are also detected, with an expected background of $0.22^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$, leading to a statistical significance of 5.7$\sigma$. The signal events include neutrinos with energies in the TeV range, the highest-energy electron and muon neutrinos ever detected from an artificial source. The energy-independent part of the interaction cross section per nucleon is measured over an energy range of 560--1740 GeV (520--1760 GeV) for $\nu_e$ ($\nu_{\mu}$) to be $(1.2_{-0.7}^{+0.8}) \times 10^{-38}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ ($(0.5\pm0.2) \times 10^{-38}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$), consistent with Standard Model predictions. These are the first measurements of neutrino interaction cross sections in those energy ranges.</description>

      <title>Muon Ring and FCC-ee / CEPC Based Antimuon-Electron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the construction of an antimuon-electron collider at KEK has been proposed. We argue that the construction of a similar muon ring tangential to FCC-ee and CEPC will give an opportunity to realize antimuon-electron collisions at higher center-of-mass energies. Moreover, the same ring may be used later to realize energy-frontier antimuon-proton colliders based on FCC-pp and SppC. Similarly, changing of electron ring in {\mu}TRISTAN project into proton ring will give opportunity to investigate lepton-hadron collisions at ~2 TeV center-of-mass energies. In this paper the main parameters of proposed colliders have been studied. It is shown that sufficiently high luminosities can be achieved for all proposals under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new type of wavefunction for the universe computed from the Euclidean path integral, with asymptotically $AdS$ boundary conditions. In the semiclassical limit, it describes a Euclidean (half)-wormhole geometry, exhibiting a local maximum of the scale factor at the surface of reflection symmetry, giving rise to an expanding universe upon analytic continuation to Lorentzian signature. We find that these Euclidean wormholes set natural initial conditions for inflation and that the semi-classical Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunction can favor a long lasting inflationary epoch, resolving a well known issue of the no-boundary proposal. Due to the asymptotic $AdS$ conditions in the Euclidean past they raise the possibility of describing the physics of inflating cosmologies and their perturbations within the context of holography.</description>

      <title>Four-gluon vertex from the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the four-gluon vertex from the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order for a collinear configuration. Our results display a good agreement with the first lattice data for this vertex, released very recently (arXiv:2401.12008). A noteworthy novelty of our work is that we can provide analytical expressions for the four-gluon vertex in collinear configurations, together with a renormalization scheme that allows us to perform reliable perturbative computations even in the infrared regime. We observe an infrared suppression in the form factor associated with the tree-level four-gluon tensor with a possible zero-crossing in the deep infrared which demands new lattice investigations to be confirmed. Moreover, we report an infrared divergence in the completely symmetric tensor form factor due to the ghost-loop contributions. These results come as predictions since previous two-point correlations fix all the available parameters of the model, up to an overall constant factor.</description>

      <title>Loop Quantum Gravity effects on electromagnetic properties of charged leptons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efforts in this contribution consist in reassessing a modified Dirac equation that incorporates a $\gamma^0 \gamma_5$-Lorentz-symmetry violating (LSV) term induced as a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effect. Originally, this equation has been applied and considered as a good scenario for describing a number of investigations on the flight time of cosmic photons and neutrinos, which suggests that the speed of light in vacuum, in connection with the geometry that describes a granular space-time, takes an energy-dependent form, e.g., $v(E) =1 \pm E/E_{\tiny{\textrm{LSV}}}$, with $E_{\tiny{\textrm{LSV}}} \approx 6,5 \times 10^{17}$ GeV for neutrinos. Once LQG provides a viable way to consistently understand this picture, we pursue an analysis of this effective Dirac equation to inspect some of its properties. These include: the derivation of the modified fermionic propagator, attainment of the Gordon decomposition of the vector current with minimal electromagnetic coupling to obtain information on the form factors, examination of the non-relativistic limit of the equation, evaluation of the spin- and velocity-dependent corrections to the Coulomb potential due to LQG effects, and the modified Hamiltonian in the low-relativistic regime. The study of the form factors may open up paths to set up bounds on the LQG parameters from the precision measurements of electromagnetic attributes of the charged leptons, such as their respective electric and magnetic dipole moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum kinetic evolution of neutrinos in dense environments, such as the core-collapse supernovae or the neutron star mergers, can result in fast flavor conversion (FFC), presenting a significant challenge to achieving robust astrophysical modeling of these systems. Recent works that directly simulate the quantum kinetic transport of neutrinos in localized domains have suggested that the asymptotic outcome of FFCs can be modeled by simple analytical prescriptions. In this Letter, we incorporate the analytical prescriptions into global simulations that solve the classical neutrino transport equation including collisions and advection under spherical symmetry. We demonstrate excellent agreement between results obtained using this approach and those directly from the corresponding global quantum kinetic simulations. In particular, this effective method can also precisely capture the collisional feedback effect for cases where the FFC happens inside the neutrinosphere. Our work highlights that a robust integration of FFCs in classical neutrino transport used in astrophysical simulation can be feasible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study black hole (BH) solutions in extended Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories which is classified in a subclass of the $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories. The scalar field is coupled to the vector field, which has electric and magnetic charges. For the static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate modifications to the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions focusing on the three types of scalar-vector interactions, including derivative couplings. We solve the field equations analytically in two asymptotic regions which are the vicinity of the BH horizon and the spatial infinity, and clarify the condition for the existence of scalar hair. To understand the behaviors of solutions in intermediate scales, the field equations are integrated numerically for concrete models with different types of couplings. We find new hairy BH solutions with scalar hair in the presence of magnetic charge and kinetic coupling. The magnetic charge plays an important role in distinguishing hairy BH solutions originated from three types of different interactions at a large coupling limit.</description>

Abstract: Vacuum decay and symmetry breaking play an important role in the fundamental structure of the matter and the evolution of the universe. In this work we study how the purely classical effect of accretion of fundamental fields onto black holes can lead to shells of symmetry restoration in the midst of a symmetry broken phase. We also show how it can catalyze vacuum decay, forming a bubble that expands asymptotically at the speed of light. These effects offer an alternative, purely classical mechanism to quantum tunnelling for seeding phase transitions in the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the new physics phenomena of gravidynamics governed by the inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry based on the gravitational quantum field theory. Such a gravidynamics enables us to derive the generalized Einstein equation and an equation beyond it. To simplify the analyses, we linearize the dynamic equations of gravitational interaction by keeping terms up to the leading order in the dual gravigauge field. We then apply the linearized dynamic equations into two particular gravitational phenomena. First, we consider the linearized equations in the absence of source fields, which is shown to have five physical propagating polarizations as gravitational waves, i.e., two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar, instead of two tensor polarizations in the general relativity. Second, we examine the Newtonian limit in which the gravitational fields and the matter source distribution are weak and static. By deriving the associated Poisson equation, we obtain the exact relation of the fundamental interaction coupling in the gravidynamics with the experimentally measured Newtonian constant. We also make use of nonrelativistic objects and relativistic photons to probe the Newtonian field configurations. In particular, the experiments from the gravitational deflection of light rays and the Shapiro time delay can place stringent constraints on the linearized gravidynamics in the gravitational quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay in candidate nuclei play a crucial role in interpreting results from current experiments and in designing future ones. Accurate NME values serve as important nuclear inputs for constraining parameters in new physics, such as neutrino mass and the Wilson coefficients of lepton-number-violating (LNV) operators. In this study, we present a comprehensive calculation of NMEs for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{100}$Mo, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using nuclear wave functions obtained from multi-reference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT). We employ three types of transition potentials at the leading order in chiral effective field theory. Our results, along with recent data, are utilized to constrain the coefficients of LNV operators. We find that NMEs for the standard and short-range mechanisms are significantly larger than those for the non-standard long-range mechanism. The use of NMEs from various nuclear models does not notably change the parameter space intervals for the coefficients, although MR-CDFT yields the most stringent constraint. Furthermore, our NMEs can also be used to perform a more comprehensive analysis with multiple isotopes.</description>

      <title>Searching for large dark matter clumps using the Galileo Satnav clock variations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents bounds on transient variations of fundamental constants, with typical timescales ranging from minutes to months, using clocks in space. The underlying phenomenology describing such transient variations relies on models for Dark Matter (DM) which suggest possible encounters of macroscopic compact objects with the Earth, due to the motion of the solar system in the galactic halo. If such compact objects possess an effective feeble interaction with the ordinary matter beyond the gravitational one, it may result in effective transient variations of fundamental constants. Such variations leave signatures on clocks onboard GNSS satellites. In this paper, we introduce a phenomenological study dedicated to the search for such DM transient objects using the network of passive hydrogen masers (H-Masers) onboard Galileo satellites. We first model the signature of transient variations of fundamental constants as a frequency modulation in the difference between two satellite clocks, considering the satellite trajectories relative to the transient event. Then, we present first results based on a fast analysis method, the maximum reach analysis. The main result is a significant extension of the discovery range for DM transients, with a sensitivity never achieved before. We investigate indeed the range of transient sizes from $10^5$ to $10^9$ kilometres, which, apart from indirect and model-dependent non-transient effects, has never been explored previously.</description>

Abstract: The total and differential cross sections of elastic proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering are studied in a holographic QCD model, considering the Pomeron and Reggeon exchanges in the Regge regime. In our model setup, the Pomeron and Reggeon exchanges are described by the Reggeized spin-2 glueball and vector meson propagators, respectively. How those contributions change with the energy is explicitly shown, focusing on the contribution ratios. The adjustable parameters included in the model are determined with the experimental data, and it is presented that the resulting total and differential cross sections are consistent with the data in a wide kinematic region.</description>

      <title>Can Leptonic Mixing Matrix have a Wolfenstein Form?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the possibility of the leptonic mixing matrix having a Wolfenstein form at the Grand Unified Theory scale. The renormalization group evolution of masses and mixing angles from the high scale to electroweak scale, in certain new physics scenarios, can significantly alter the form of the leptonic mixing matrix. In the past it was shown that such significant enhancement implies that the leptonic mixing matrix at high scale can be the same or similar in structure to the quark one. We thoroughly analyze this hypothesis in the light of the latest neutrino oscillation data as well as other constraints such as those coming from neutrinoless double beta decay. We show that such an ansatz, at least within the context of minimal supersymmetric models, is no longer compatible with the latest experimental data.</description>

      <title>Polarization of recoil photon in non-linear Compton process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarization of recoil photon ($\gamma'$) in the non-linear Compton process $e + \vec L \to \vec \gamma' +e'$ in the interaction of a relativistic electron with a linearly polarized laser beam ($\vec L$) is studied within the Furry picture in the lowest-order, tree-level S matrix element. In particular, we consider the asymmetry of differential cross sections ${\cal A}$ for two independent axes describing the Compton process equal to the intrinsic spin variable ${\xi}^f_3$, that determines the polarization properties of $\gamma'$. The sign and absolute value of the asymmetry determine the direction and degree of $\gamma'$ polarization. We have analyzed the process in a wide range of laser intensity that covers existing and future experiments. Our results provide additional knowledge for studying nonlinear multi-photon effects in quantum electrodynamics and can be used in planning experiments at envisaged laser facilities.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $b\rightarrow c\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$ anomalies using weak effective Hamiltonian with complex couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental measurements of the branching ratios and different polarization asymmetries for the processes occurring through flavor-changing-charged current $b\rightarrow c\tau\overline{\nu}_{\tau}$ transitions by BABAR, Belle, and LHCb show some sparkling differences with the corresponding SM predictions. Assuming the left handed neutrinos, we add the dimension-six vector, (pseudo-)scalar, and tensor operators with complex WCs to the SM WEH. Together with 60%, 30% and 10% constraints coming from the branching ratio of $B_{c}\to\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$, we analyze the parametric space of these new physics WCs accommodating the current anomalies in the purview of the most recent HFLAV data of $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D\right)$, $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^*\right)$ and Belle data of $F_{L}\left(D^*\right)$ and $P_{\tau}\left(D^*\right)$. Furthermore, we derive the sum rules which correlate these observables with $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D\right)$ and $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^*\right)$. Using the best-fit points of the new complex WCs along with the latest measurements of $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^{(*)}\right)$, we predict the numerical values of the observable $R_{\tau/\ell}\left(\Lambda_c\right)$, $R_{\tau/\mu}\left(J/\psi\right)$ and $R_{\tau/\ell}\left(X_c\right)$ from the sum rules. Apart from finding the correlation matrix among the observables under consideration, we plot them graphically which is useful to discriminate different NP scenarios. Finally, we study the impact of these NP couplings on various angular and the CP triple product asymmetries, that could be measured in some ongoing and future experiments. The precise measurements of these observables are important to check the SM and extract the possible NP.</description>

      <title>Light Thermal Self-Interacting Dark Matter in the Shadow of Non-Standard Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a viable model for a GeV scale self-interacting dark matter (DM), where the DM was thermally produced in the early universe. Here, a new vector-like fermion with a dark charge under the $U(1)_{D}$ gauge symmetry serves as a secluded WIMP DM and it can dominantly annihilate into the light dark gauge boson and singlet scalar through the dark gauge interaction. Also, the self-interaction of DM is induced by the light dark gauge boson via the same gauge interaction. In addition to these particles, we further introduce two Weyl fermions and a doublet scalar, by which the dark gauge boson produced from s-wave DM annihilations can mostly decay into active neutrinos after the dark symmetry breaking such that the CMB bound on the DM with low masses can be eluded. In order to have a common parameter region to explain the observed relic abundance and self-interaction of DM, we also study this model in a non-standard cosmological evolution, where the cosmic expansion driven by a new field species is faster than the standard radiation-dominated universe during the frozen time of DM. Reversely, one can also use the self-interacting nature of light thermal DM to examine the non-standard cosmological history of the universe.</description>

      <title>Negative Barnett effect, negative moment of inertia of (quark-)gluon plasma and thermal evaporation of chromomagnetic condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the negativity of the moment of inertia of (quark-)gluon plasma in a window of "supervortical" range of temperatures above the deconfining phase transition, $T \simeq (1\dots 1.5) T_c $ found recently in numerical Monte Carlo simulations by two independent methods. In our work, we confirm numerically that the origin of this effect is rooted in the thermal evaporation of the non-perturbative chromomagnetic condensate. We argue that the negative moment of inertia of gluon plasma indicates the presence of a novel effect, the negative spin-vortical coupling for gluons resulting in a negative gluonic Barnett effect: the spin polarization of gluons exceeds the total angular momentum of rotating plasma thus forcing the orbital angular momentum to take negative values in the supervortical range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>The Cosmology of Dark Energy Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the cosmological signatures of dark energy radiation -- a novel description of dark energy, which proposes that the dynamical component of dark energy is comprised of a thermal bath of relativistic particles sourced by thermal friction from a slowly rolling scalar field. For a minimal model with particle production emerging from first principles, we find that the abundance of radiation sourced by dark energy can be as large as $\Omega_{\text{DER}} = 0.03$, exceeding the bounds on relic dark radiation by three orders of magnitude. Although the background and perturbative evolution of dark energy radiation is distinct from Quintessence, we find that current and near-future cosmic microwave background and supernova data will not distinguish these models of dark energy. We also find that our constraints on all models are dominated by their impact on the expansion rate of the Universe. Considering extensions that allow the dark radiation to populate neutrinos, axions, and dark photons, we evaluate the direct detection prospects of a thermal background comprised of these candidates consistent with cosmological constraints on dark energy radiation. Our study indicates that a resolution of $\sim 6 \, \text{meV}$ is required to achieve sensitivity to relativistic neutrinos compatible with dark energy radiation in a neutrino capture experiment on tritium. We also find that dark matter axion experiments lack sensitivity to a relativistic thermal axion background, even if enhanced by dark energy radiation, and dedicated search strategies are required to probe new parameter space. We derive constraints arising from a dark photon background from oscillations into visible photons, and find that viable parameter space can be explored with the LAte Dark Energy RAdiation (LADERA) experiment.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Dark Matter in $SU(7)$ Grand Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a grand unified theory (GUT) pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) dark matter (DM) model based on $SU(7)$ gauge symmetry. In the GUT model, the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry $G_{\rm SM} := SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ and the ``dark'' gauge symmetry $SU(2)_D$ are unified, where the $SU(2)_D$ symmetry plays an important role in the stability of DM. The unification of SM fermions and dark sector fermions is partially realized. The gauge symmetry $SU(7)$ is spontaneously broken to $SU(5)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge symmetry at the GUT scale by the nonvanishing vacuum expectation values of an $SU(7)$ adjoint scalar field. The symmetry is further broken to $G_{\rm SM}\times SU(2)_D$ at an intermediate scale. Furthermore, the $SU(2)_D$ symmetry is broken by the $SU(2)_D$ doublet and triplet scalar fields at the TeV scale. In the pNGB DM model based on $G_{\rm SM}\times SU(2)_D$, the residual global $U(1)_V$ dark custodial symmetry guarantees DM stability. On the other hand, in the $SU(7)$ pNGB DM model, this global symmetry is explicitly broken by the Yukawa interaction and the effective Majorana mass terms. To maintain $U(1)_V$ symmetry and thus the DM stability, we need to tune Yukawa coupling constants and cubic scalar couplings at high accuracy. We find that the allowed DM mass region is quite restricted as the gauge coupling constant of $SU(2)_D$ is determined by the condition of the gauge coupling unification. To satisfy gauge coupling unification and the current experimental constraint on proton lifetime, we find that three generations of $SU(3)_C$ adjoint fermions and another three generations of $SU(2)_L$ adjoint fermions with the intermediate mass scale are required. We also find that there is no other solution to satisfy simultaneously the gauge coupling unification and the proton decay constraint if one assumes the other symmetry breaking schemes.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Mass Matrices with Generalized CP Symmetries and Texture Zeros</title>

Abstract: We investigate the properties of neutrino mass matrices that incorporate texture zeros and generalized CP symmetries associated with tribimaximal mixing. By combining these approaches, we derive predictive neutrino mass matrices and explore their implications for mass hierarchies, mixing angles, and CP-violating phases. We find that the three angles defining the generalized CP symmetries have narrow allowed ranges. We also obtain distinct correlations between the three mixing angles and the CP-violating phases that distinguish the various texture patterns from one another. Moreover, we compute the effective neutrino mass for neutrinoless double beta decay and the sum of neutrino masses. Our results highlight the predictability and testability of neutrino mass matrices with generalized CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced contribution of the pairing gap to the QCD equation of state at large isospin chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study QCD at large isospin density, which is known to be in the superfluid state with Cooper pairs carrying the same quantum number as pions. I solve the gap equation derived from the perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order corrections. The pairing gap at large isospin chemical potential is found to be enhanced compared to the color-superconducting gap at large baryon chemical potential due to the $\sqrt{2}$ difference in the exponent arising from the stronger attraction in one-gluon exchange in the singlet channel. Then, using the gap function, I evaluate the contribution of the condensation energy of the superfluid state to the QCD equation of state. At isospin chemical potential of a few GeV, where the lattice QCD and the perturbative QCD can be both applied, the effect of the condensation energy becomes dominant even compared to the next-to-leading order corrections to the pressure in the perturbation theory. It resolves the discrepancy between the recent lattice QCD results and the perturbative QCD result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy particles traversing the Quark-Gluon plasma experience modified (massive) dispersion, although their vacuum mass is negligible compared to the kinetic energy. Due to poor convergence of the perturbative series in the regime of soft loop momenta, a more precise determination of this effective mass is needed. This paper continues our investigation on the factorisation between strongly-coupled infrared classical and perturbative ultraviolet behavior. The former has been studied non-perturbatively within EQCD by determining a non-local operator on the lattice. By computing the temperature-scale contribution to the same operator in 4D QCD at next-to-leading order (NLO), we remove the ultraviolet divergence of the EQCD calculation with an opposite infrared divergence from the hard thermal scale. The result is a consistent, regulator-independent determination of the classical contribution where the emergence of new divergences signals sensitivities to new regions of phase space. We address the numerical impact of the classical and NLO thermal corrections on the convergence of the factorised approach and on the partial applicability of our results to calculations of transport coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To improve our understanding of the quark-gluon dynamics underlying multiquark states, we systematically study their electromagnetic properties. In this study, the magnetic and quadrupole moments of the theoretically predicted singly-charmed state with the quantum numbers $\mathrm{J^P = 1^+}$ is investigated within the framework of the QCD light-cone sum rules method by considering the diquark-antidiquark configuration of this state with quark contents $[ud][\bar{c}\bar{s}]$. The predicted results for the magnetic and quadrupole moments are as $\mu_{\mathrm{X_{AV}}}=-0.89 ^{+0.14}_{-0.12}~\mu_N $ and $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{X_{AV}}} = (-0.46 ^{+0.07}_{-0.06})\times 10^{-2} ~\mbox{fm}^2$. The results obtained can be useful in determining the exact nature of this state. This work will hopefully stimulate experimental interest in the study of the electromagnetic properties of multiquark systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmark calculations of fully heavy compact and molecular tetraquark states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the mass spectrum of the S-wave fully heavy tetraquark systems $ QQ\bar Q\bar Q~(Q=c,b) $ with both normal $ (J^{PC}=0^{++},1^{+-},2^{++}) $ and exotic $ (J^{PC}=0^{+-},1^{++},2^{+-}) $ C-parities using three different quark potential models (AL1, AP1, BGS). The exotic C-parity systems refer to the ones that cannot be composed of two S-wave ground heavy quarkonia. We incorporate the molecular dimeson and compact diquark-antidiquark spatial correlations simultaneously, thereby discerning the actual configurations of the states. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, and the complex scaling method to identify the resonant states. The mass spectra in three different models qualitatively agree with each other. We obtain several resonant states with $ J^{PC} = 0^{++}, 1^{+-}, 2^{++}, 1^{++} $ in the mass region $(6.92,7.30)\, \mathrm{GeV}$, some of which are good candidates of the experimentally observed $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$. We also obtain several exotic C-parity zero-width states with $ J^{PC}=0^{+-} $ and $ 2^{+-} $. These zero-width states have no corresponding S-wave diquarkonium threshold and can only decay strongly to final states with P-wave quarkonia. With the notation $T_{4Q,J(C)}(M)$, we deduce from the root mean square radii that the $ X(7200) $ candidates $ T_{4c,0(+)}(7173), T_{4c,2(+)}(7214) $ and the state $ T_{4c,1(-)}(7191) $ look like molecular states although most of the resonant and zero-width states are compact states.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we reconsider the states $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ by investigating the presence of diquark-anti-diquark components as well as the hadronic molecule components in the framework of effective field theory. The different masses of pseudoscalar mesons such as $\pi^{0}$, $\eta_{8}$, and $\eta_{0}$, as well as vector mesons like $\rho^{0}$ and $\omega$ violate the OZI rule that is well depicted under the $[U(3)_L\otimes U(3)_R]_{global}\otimes [U(3)_V]_{local}$ symmetry. To account for the contribution of intermediate bosons of heavy masses within the OBE model, we introduce an exponential form factor instead of the commonly used monopole form factor in the past. By solving the coupled-channel Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the Gaussian expansion method, our numerical results indicate that the $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ states can be explained as hadronic molecules slightly mixing with diquark-anti-diquark states.</description>

Abstract: Extrapolating the Standard Model Higgs potential at high energies, we study the barrier between the electroweak and Planck scale minima. The barrier arises by taking the central values of the relevant experimental inputs, that is the strong coupling constant and the top quark and Higgs masses. We then extend the Standard Model by including a non-minimal coupling to gravity, and explore the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model. We point out that even configurations that would be metastable in the Standard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is large enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier; we find that the required value of the non-minimal coupling is smaller than the one needed for the conventional Higgs inflation scenario (which relies on a stable Standard Model Higgs potential, without any barrier); in addition, values of the top mass which are slightly larger than those required in the conventional scenario are allowed.</description>

Abstract: We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a (few) TeV scale $\rho_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale $\rho_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter $\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m_\chi&lt;\rho_1$, is localized in the dark brane. The radion, with mass $m_r&lt;m_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim m_\chi/\rho_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim m_{f}\rho_1/\rho_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane with $\rho_1\lesssim 10$~GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim 2$ GeV the relic abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Effective Lagrangian Morphing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the LHC entering the precision era, focus on interpreting the measurements performed in an effective field theory holds key to testing the Standard Model. An effective field theory provides a well-defined theoretical formalism which extends the Standard Model by introduce new terms with free coefficients that can be measured with experimental data. Constructing models parametric in these new coefficients is achieved by virtue of combining predictions from Monte Carlo generators for different interactions. This paper builds upon earlier works and describes a state-of-the-art approach to build multidimensional parametric models for new physics using effective Lagrangians. Documentation and tutorials for an associated toolkit that have been contributed to the ROOT data analysis software framework is included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel first order action principle has been proposed as the possible foundation for a more fundamental theory of General Relativity and the Standard Model. It is shown in this article that the proposal consistently incorporates gravity and matter fields, and guides to a new and robust path towards unification of fundamental interactions.</description>

      <title>Topological defect formation in a phase transition with tunable order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>New mixed inhomogeneous phase in vortical gluon plasma: first-principle results from rotating SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principle numerical simulations, we find a new spatially inhomogeneous phase in rigidly rotating $N_c = 3$ gluon plasma. This mixed phase simultaneously possesses both confining and deconfining phases in thermal equilibrium. Unexpectedly, the local critical temperature of the phase transition at the rotation axis does not depend on the angular frequency within a few percent accuracy. Even more surprisingly, an analytic continuation of our results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates a profound breaking of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law in the vicinity of the phase transition, with the confining (deconfining) phase appearing far (near) the rotation axis.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy in Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the entanglement entropy of a subregion of the vacuum state in scalar quantum electrodynamics, working perturbatively to the 2-loops level. Doing so leads us to derive the Maxwell-Proca propagator in conical Euclidean space. The area law of entanglement entropy is recovered in both the massive and massless limits of the theory, as is expected. These results yield the renormalisation group flow of entanglement entropy, and we find that loop contributions suppress entanglement entropy. We highlight these results in the light of the renormalization group flow of couplings and correlators, which are increased in scalar quantum electrodynamics, so that the potential tension between the increase in correlations between two points of spacetime and the decrease in entanglement entropy between two regions of spacetime with energy is discussed. We indeed show that the vacuum of a subregion of spacetime purifies with energy in scalar quantum electrodynamics, which is related to the concept of screening.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the second edition of "The Supersymmetric World"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first Edition of this book was released in 2000, just before the symposium ``Thirty Years of Supersymmetry'' was held at the William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute (FTPI) of the University of Minnesota. Founders and trailblazers of supersymmetry descended on FTPI, as well as a large crowd of younger theorists deeply involved in research in this area. Since then 23 years have elapsed and significant changes happened in supersymmetry (SUSY). Its history definitely needs an update. Such an update is presented below. The Second Edition of the revised collection will be released in 2024.</description>

      <title>Bjorken and threshold limit of a space-like structure function in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate a simple coordinate space structure function ${\cal E}(z^2m^2,\lambda)$ in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model to the next-to-leading order in the large $N$ expansion. We analytically perform the twist expansion in the Bjorken limit through double Mellin representations. Hard and non-perturbative scaling functions are naturally generated in their Borel representations with detailed enumerations and explicit expressions provided to all powers. The renormalon cancellation at $t=n$ between the hard functions at powers $p$ and the non-perturbative functions at powers $p+n$ are explicitly verified, and the issue of "scale-dependency" of the perturbative and non-perturbative functions is explained naturally. Simple expressions for the leading power non-perturbative functions are also provided both in the coordinate space and the momentum-fraction space ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) with "zero-mode-type" subtractions at $\alpha=0$ discussed in detail. In addition to the Bjorken limit, we also perform the threshold expansion of the structure function up to the next-to-next-to-leading threshold power exactly and investigate its relation to the twist expansion. In the appendix, we prove that the twist expansion is absolutely convergent for any $0&lt;z^2&lt;\infty$ and any $ \lambda \in iR_{\ge 0}$.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and First Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the 5PM order contributions to the scattering angle and impulse of classical black hole scattering in the conservative sector at first self-force order (1SF) using the worldline quantum field theory formalism. This challenging four-loop computation required the use of advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology implemented on high-performance computing systems. Use of partial fraction identities allowed us to render the complete integrand in a fully planar form. The resulting function space is simpler than expected: in the scattering angle we see only multiple polylogarithms up to weight three, and a total absence of the elliptic integrals that appeared at 4PM order. All checks on our result, both internal - cancellation of dimensional regularization poles, preservation of the on-shell condition - and external - matching the slow-velocity limit with the post-Newtonian (PN) literature up to 5PN order and matching the tail terms to the 4PM loss of energy - are passed.</description>
