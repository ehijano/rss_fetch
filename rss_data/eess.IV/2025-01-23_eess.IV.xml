      <title>Comparative Analysis of Hand-Crafted and Machine-Driven Histopathological Features for Prostate Cancer Classification and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histopathological image analysis is a reliable method for prostate cancer identification. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of two approaches for segmenting glandular structures in prostate images to automate Gleason grading. The first approach utilizes a hand-crafted learning technique, combining Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture descriptors to highlight spatial dependencies and minimize information loss at the pixel level. For machine driven feature extraction, we employ a U-Net convolutional neural network to perform semantic segmentation of prostate gland stroma tissue. Support vector machine-based learning of hand-crafted features achieves impressive classification accuracies of 99.0% and 95.1% for GLCM and LBP, respectively, while the U-Net-based machine-driven features attain 94% accuracy. Furthermore, a comparative analysis demonstrates superior segmentation quality for histopathological grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 using the U-Net approach, as assessed by Jaccard and Dice metrics. This work underscores the utility of machine-driven features in clinical applications that rely on automated pixel-level segmentation in prostate tissue images.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage intermediate fusion for multimodal learning to classify non-small cell lung cancer subtypes from CT and PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of histological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential in the era of precision medicine, yet current invasive techniques are not always feasible and may lead to clinical complications. This study presents a multi-stage intermediate fusion approach to classify NSCLC subtypes from CT and PET images. Our method integrates the two modalities at different stages of feature extraction, using voxel-wise fusion to exploit complementary information across varying abstraction levels while preserving spatial correlations. We compare our method against unimodal approaches using only CT or PET images to demonstrate the benefits of modality fusion, and further benchmark it against early and late fusion techniques to highlight the advantages of intermediate fusion during feature extraction. Additionally, we compare our model with the only existing intermediate fusion method for histological subtype classification using PET/CT images. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all alternatives across key metrics, with an accuracy and AUC equal to 0.724 and 0.681, respectively. This non-invasive approach has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate more informed treatment decisions, and advance personalized care in lung cancer management.</description>

      <title>Slot-BERT: Self-supervised Object Discovery in Surgical Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is a powerful framework for unsupervised learning of structured and explainable representations that can support reasoning about objects and actions, including in surgical videos. While conventional object-centric methods for videos leverage recurrent processing to achieve efficiency, they often struggle with maintaining long-range temporal coherence required for long videos in surgical applications. On the other hand, fully parallel processing of entire videos enhances temporal consistency but introduces significant computational overhead, making it impractical for implementation on hardware in medical facilities. We present Slot-BERT, a bidirectional long-range model that learns object-centric representations in a latent space while ensuring robust temporal coherence. Slot-BERT scales object discovery seamlessly to long videos of unconstrained lengths. A novel slot contrastive loss further reduces redundancy and improves the representation disentanglement by enhancing slot orthogonality. We evaluate Slot-BERT on real-world surgical video datasets from abdominal, cholecystectomy, and thoracic procedures. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art object-centric approaches under unsupervised training achieving superior performance across diverse domains. We also demonstrate efficient zero-shot domain adaptation to data from diverse surgical specialties and databases.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Brain Image Translation using Transfer Learning from Generic Pre-trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various neurological disorders, providing valuable insights into the structure and function of the brain. Techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) enable non-invasive visualization of the brain, aiding in the understanding of brain anatomy, abnormalities, and functional connectivity. However, cost and radiation dose may limit the acquisition of specific image modalities, so medical image synthesis can be used to generate required medical images without actual addition. In the medical domain, where obtaining labeled medical images is labor-intensive and expensive, addressing data scarcity is a major challenge. Recent studies propose using transfer learning to overcome this issue. This involves adapting pre-trained CycleGAN models, initially trained on non-medical data, to generate realistic medical images. In this work, transfer learning was applied to the task of MR-CT image translation and vice versa using 18 pre-trained non-medical models, and the models were fine-tuned to have the best result. The models' performance was evaluated using four widely used image quality metrics: Peak-signal-to-noise-ratio, Structural Similarity Index, Universal Quality Index, and Visual Information Fidelity. Quantitative evaluation and qualitative perceptual analysis by radiologists demonstrate the potential of transfer learning in medical imaging and the effectiveness of the generic pre-trained model. The results provide compelling evidence of the model's exceptional performance, which can be attributed to the high quality and similarity of the training images to actual human brain images. These results underscore the significance of carefully selecting appropriate and representative training images to optimize performance in brain image analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Lung Ultrasound Severity Scoring Using Dedicated Feature Extractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound imaging has emerged as a promising technique for COVID-19 detection, due to its non-invasive nature, affordability, and portability. In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Image Motion Blur Removal in the Temporal Dimension with Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most motion deblurring algorithms rely on spatial-domain convolution models, which struggle with the complex, non-linear blur arising from camera shake and object motion. In contrast, we propose a novel single-image deblurring approach that treats motion blur as a temporal averaging phenomenon. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a pre-trained video diffusion transformer model to capture diverse motion dynamics within a latent space. It sidesteps explicit kernel estimation and effectively accommodates diverse motion patterns. We implement the algorithm within a diffusion-based inverse problem framework. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in deblurring complex motion blur scenarios. This work paves the way for utilizing powerful video diffusion models to address single-image deblurring challenges.</description>

      <title>The Marginal Importance of Distortions and Alignment in CASSI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a differentiable ray-tracing based model that incorporates aberrations and distortions to render realistic coded hyperspectral acquisitions using Coded-Aperture Spectral Snapshot Imagers (CASSI). CASSI systems can now be optimized in order to fulfill simultaneously several optical design constraints as well as processing constraints. Four comparable CASSI systems with varying degree of optical aberrations have been designed and modeled. The resulting rendered hyperspectral acquisitions from each of these systems are combined with five state-of-the-art hyperspectral cube reconstruction processes. These reconstruction processes encompass a mapping function created from each system's propagation model to account for distortions and aberrations during the reconstruction process. Our analyses show that if properly modeled, the effects of geometric distortions of the system and misalignments of the dispersive elements have a marginal impact on the overall quality of the reconstructed hyperspectral data cubes. Therefore, relaxing traditional constraints on measurement conformity and fidelity to the scene enables the development of novel imaging instruments, guided by performance metrics applied to the design or the processing of acquisitions. By providing a complete framework for design, simulation and evaluation, this work contributes to the optimization and exploration of new CASSI systems, and more generally to the computational imaging community.</description>

      <title>FDG-Diff: Frequency-Domain-Guided Diffusion Framework for Compressed Hazy Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we reveal that the interaction between haze degradation and JPEG compression introduces complex joint loss effects, which significantly complicate image restoration. Existing dehazing models often neglect compression effects, which limits their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions. First, we design FDG-Diff, a novel frequency-domain-guided dehazing framework that improves JPEG image restoration by leveraging frequency-domain information. Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches.

      <title>Learning accurate rigid registration for longitudinal brain MRI from synthetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigid registration aims to determine the translations and rotations necessary to align features in a pair of images. While recent machine learning methods have become state-of-the-art for linear and deformable registration across subjects, they have demonstrated limitations when applied to longitudinal (within-subject) registration, where achieving precise alignment is critical. Building on an existing framework for anatomy-aware, acquisition-agnostic affine registration, we propose a model optimized for longitudinal, rigid brain registration. By training the model with synthetic within-subject pairs augmented with rigid and subtle nonlinear transforms, the model estimates more accurate rigid transforms than previous cross-subject networks and performs robustly on longitudinal registration pairs within and across magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasts.</description>

      <title>fabSAM: A Farmland Boundary Delineation Method Based on the Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delineating farmland boundaries is essential for agricultural management such as crop monitoring and agricultural census. Traditional methods using remote sensing imagery have been efficient but limited in generalisation. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its impressive zero shot performance, has been adapted for remote sensing tasks through prompt learning and fine tuning. Here, we propose a SAM based farmland boundary delineation framework 'fabSAM' that combines a Deeplabv3+ based Prompter and SAM. Also, a fine tuning strategy was introduced to enable SAMs decoder to improve the use of prompt information. Experimental results on the AI4Boundaries and AI4SmallFarms datasets have shown that fabSAM has a significant improvement in farmland region identification and boundary delineation. Compared to zero shot SAM, fabSAM surpassed it by 23.5% and 15.1% in mIOU on the AI4Boundaries and AI4SmallFarms datasets, respectively. For Deeplabv3+, fabSAM outperformed it by 4.9% and 12.5% in mIOU, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of fabSAM, which also means that we can more easily obtain the global farmland region and boundary maps from open source satellite image datasets like Sentinel2.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Image Recovery and Pose Estimation for Resident Space Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the density of spacecraft in Earth's orbit increases, their recognition, pose and trajectory identification becomes crucial for averting potential collisions and executing debris removal operations. However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Lungs: Extending the Field of View in Chest CT with Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interconnection between the human lungs and other organs, such as the liver and kidneys, is crucial for understanding the underlying risks and effects of lung diseases and improving patient care. However, most research chest CT imaging is focused solely on the lungs due to considerations of cost and radiation dose. This restricted field of view (FOV) in the acquired images poses challenges to comprehensive analysis and hinders the ability to gain insights into the impact of lung diseases on other organs. To address this, we propose SCOPE (Spatial Coverage Optimization with Prior Encoding), a novel approach to capture the inter-organ relationships from CT images and extend the FOV of chest CT images. Our approach first trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode 2D axial CT slices individually, then stacks the latent representations of the VAE to form a 3D context for training a latent diffusion model. Once trained, our approach extends the FOV of CT images in the z-direction by generating new axial slices in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated our approach on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset, and results suggest that it effectively extends the FOV to include the liver and kidneys, which are not completely covered in the original NLST data acquisition. Quantitative results on a held-out whole-body dataset demonstrate that the generated slices exhibit high fidelity with acquired data, achieving an SSIM of 0.81.</description>

      <title>Robust Body Composition Analysis by Generating 3D CT Volumes from Limited 2D Slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Body composition analysis provides valuable insights into aging, disease progression, and overall health conditions. Due to concerns of radiation exposure, two-dimensional (2D) single-slice computed tomography (CT) imaging has been used repeatedly for body composition analysis. However, this approach introduces significant spatial variability that can impact the accuracy and robustness of the analysis. To mitigate this issue and facilitate body composition analysis, this paper presents a novel method to generate 3D CT volumes from limited number of 2D slices using a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our approach first maps 2D slices into a latent representation space using a variational autoencoder. An LDM is then trained to capture the 3D context of a stack of these latent representations. To accurately interpolate intermediateslices and construct a full 3D volume, we utilize body part regression to determine the spatial location and distance between the acquired slices. Experiments on both in-house and public 3D abdominal CT datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances body composition analysis compared to traditional 2D-based analysis, with a reduced error rate from 23.3% to 15.2%.</description>

Abstract: Diffuse gliomas are malignant brain tumors that grow widespread through the brain. The complex interactions between neoplastic cells and normal tissue, as well as the treatment-induced changes often encountered, make glioma tumor growth modeling challenging. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end network capable of future predictions of tumor masks and multi-parametric magnetic resonance images (MRI) of how the tumor will look at any future time points for different treatment plans. Our approach is based on cutting-edge diffusion probabilistic models and deep-segmentation neural networks. We included sequential multi-parametric MRI and treatment information as conditioning inputs to guide the generative diffusion process as well as a joint segmentation process. This allows for tumor growth estimates and realistic MRI generation at any given treatment and time point. We trained the model using real-world postoperative longitudinal MRI data with glioma tumor growth trajectories represented as tumor segmentation maps over time. The model demonstrates promising performance across various tasks, including generating high-quality multi-parametric MRI with tumor masks, performing time-series tumor segmentations, and providing uncertainty estimates. Combined with the treatment-aware generated MRI, the tumor growth predictions with uncertainty estimates can provide useful information for clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>MD-Dose: A diffusion model based on the Mamba for radiation dose prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation therapy is crucial in cancer treatment. Experienced experts typically iteratively generate high-quality dose distribution maps, forming the basis for excellent radiation therapy plans. Therefore, automated prediction of dose distribution maps is significant in expediting the treatment process and providing a better starting point for developing radiation therapy plans. With the remarkable results of diffusion models in predicting high-frequency regions of dose distribution maps, dose prediction methods based on diffusion models have been extensively studied. However, existing methods mainly utilize CNNs or Transformers as denoising networks. CNNs lack the capture of global receptive fields, resulting in suboptimal prediction performance. Transformers excel in global modeling but face quadratic complexity with image size, resulting in significant computational overhead. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion model, MD-Dose, based on the Mamba architecture for predicting radiation therapy dose distribution in thoracic cancer patients. In the forward process, MD-Dose adds Gaussian noise to dose distribution maps to obtain pure noise images. In the backward process, MD-Dose utilizes a noise predictor based on the Mamba to predict the noise, ultimately outputting the dose distribution maps. Furthermore, We develop a Mamba encoder to extract structural information and integrate it into the noise predictor for localizing dose regions in the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Through extensive experiments on a dataset of 300 thoracic tumor patients, we showcase the superiority of MD-Dose in various metrics and time consumption.</description>

      <title>Serpent: Scalable and Efficient Image Restoration via Multi-scale Structured State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</description>

      <title>Boosting Diffusion Guidance via Learning Degradation-Aware Models for Blind Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion-based blind super-resolution (SR) methods have shown great ability to generate high-resolution images with abundant high-frequency detail, but the detail is often achieved at the expense of fidelity. Meanwhile, another line of research focusing on rectifying the reverse process of diffusion models (i.e., diffusion guidance), has demonstrated the power to generate high-fidelity results for non-blind SR. However, these methods rely on known degradation kernels, making them difficult to apply to blind SR. To address these issues, we present DADiff in this paper. DADiff incorporates degradation-aware models into the diffusion guidance framework, eliminating the need to know degradation kernels. Additionally, we propose two novel techniques: input perturbation and guidance scalar, to further improve our performance. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method has superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on blind SR benchmarks.</description>

      <title>OpenEarthMap-SAR: A Benchmark Synthetic Aperture Radar Dataset for Global High-Resolution Land Cover Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution land cover mapping plays a crucial role in addressing a wide range of global challenges, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and sustainable development. However, creating accurate, large-scale land cover datasets remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexities of geospatial data, such as diverse terrain, varying sensor modalities, and atmospheric conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its ability to penetrate clouds and capture data in all-weather, day-and-night conditions, offers unique advantages for land cover mapping. Despite these strengths, the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for SAR imagery has limited the development of robust models specifically designed for this data modality. To bridge this gap and facilitate advancements in SAR-based geospatial analysis, we introduce OpenEarthMap-SAR, a benchmark SAR dataset, for global high-resolution land cover mapping. OpenEarthMap-SAR consists of 1.5 million segments of 5033 aerial and satellite images with the size of 1024$\times$1024 pixels, covering 35 regions from Japan, France, and the USA, with partially manually annotated and fully pseudo 8-class land cover labels at a ground sampling distance of 0.15--0.5 m. We evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and present challenging problem settings suitable for further technical development. The dataset also serves the official dataset for IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track I. The dataset has been made publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/14622048.</description>

      <title>Single-shot volumetric fluorescence imaging with neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-shot volumetric fluorescence (SVF) imaging offers a significant advantage over traditional imaging methods that require scanning across multiple axial planes as it can capture biological processes with high temporal resolution. The key challenges in SVF imaging include requiring sparsity constraints, eliminating depth ambiguity in the reconstruction, and maintaining high resolution across a large field of view. In this paper, we introduce the QuadraPol point spread function (PSF) combined with neural fields, a novel approach for SVF imaging. This method utilizes a custom polarizer at the back focal plane and a polarization camera to detect fluorescence, effectively encoding the 3D scene within a compact PSF without depth ambiguity. Additionally, we propose a reconstruction algorithm based on the neural fields technique that provides improved reconstruction quality compared to classical deconvolution methods. QuadraPol PSF, combined with neural fields, significantly reduces the acquisition time of a conventional fluorescence microscope by approximately 20 times and captures a 100 mm$^3$ cubic volume in one shot. We validate the effectiveness of both our hardware and algorithm through all-in-focus imaging of bacterial colonies on sand surfaces and visualization of plant root morphology. Our approach offers a powerful tool for advancing biological research and ecological studies.</description>

      <title>An Embedding is Worth a Thousand Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks scales with dataset size and label quality, rendering the efficient mitigation of low-quality data annotations crucial for building robust and cost-effective systems. Existing strategies to address label noise exhibit severe limitations due to computational complexity and application dependency. In this work, we propose WANN, a Weighted Adaptive Nearest Neighbor approach that builds on self-supervised feature representations obtained from foundation models. To guide the weighted voting scheme, we introduce a reliability score, which measures the likelihood of a data label being correct. WANN outperforms reference methods, including a linear layer trained with robust loss functions, on diverse datasets of varying size and under various noise types and severities. WANN also exhibits superior generalization on imbalanced data compared to both Adaptive-NNs (ANN) and fixed k-NNs. Furthermore, the proposed weighting scheme enhances supervised dimensionality reduction under noisy labels. This yields a significant boost in classification performance with 10x and 100x smaller image embeddings, minimizing latency and storage requirements. Our approach, emphasizing efficiency and explainability, emerges as a simple, robust solution to overcome inherent limitations of deep neural network training.

      <title>Towards Interpretable Radiology Report Generation via Concept Bottlenecks using a Multi-Agentic RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has advanced medical image classification, but interpretability challenges hinder its clinical adoption. This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings.
