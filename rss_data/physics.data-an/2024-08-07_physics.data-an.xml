      <title>When does the mean network capture the topology of a sample of networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of Fr\'echet mean (also known as "barycenter") network is the workhorse of most machine learning algorithms that require the estimation of a "location" parameter to analyse network-valued data. In this context, it is critical that the network barycenter inherits the topological structure of the networks in the training dataset. The metric - which measures the proximity between networks - controls the structural properties of the barycenter. This work is significant because it provides for the first time analytical estimates of the sample Fr\'echet mean for the stochastic blockmodel, which is at the cutting edge of rigorous probabilistic analysis of random networks. We show that the mean network computed with the Hamming distance is unable to capture the topology of the networks in the training sample, whereas the mean network computed using the effective resistance distance recovers the correct partitions and associated edge density. From a practical standpoint, our work informs the choice of metrics in the context where the sample Fr\'echet mean network is used to characterise the topology of networks for network-valued machine learning</description>

      <title>On the choice of the non-trainable internal weights in random feature maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computationally cheap machine learning architecture of random feature maps can be viewed as a single-layer feedforward network in which the weights of the hidden layer are random but fixed and only the outer weights are learned via linear regression. The internal weights are typically chosen from a prescribed distribution. The choice of the internal weights significantly impacts the accuracy of random feature maps. We address here the task of how to best select the internal weights. In particular, we consider the forecasting problem whereby random feature maps are used to learn a one-step propagator map for a dynamical system. We provide a computationally cheap hit-and-run algorithm to select good internal weights which lead to good forecasting skill. We show that the number of good features is the main factor controlling the forecasting skill of random feature maps and acts as an effective feature dimension. Lastly, we compare random feature maps with single-layer feedforward neural networks in which the internal weights are now learned using gradient descent. We find that random feature maps have superior forecasting capabilities whilst having several orders of magnitude lower computational cost.</description>
