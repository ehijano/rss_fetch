      <title>A practical approach of measuring $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th in liquid scintillator to sub-ppq level using ICP-MS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid scintillator (LS) is commonly utilized in experiments seeking rare events due to its high light yield, transparency, and radiopurity. The concentration of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th in LS consistently remains below 1 ppq (10$^{-15}$ g/g), and the current screening result is based on a minimum 20-ton detector. Inductively coupled plasma mass (ICP-MS) spectroscopy is well-regarded for its high sensitivity to trace $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th. This study outlines a method for detecting $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th in LS at the sub-ppq level using ICP-MS, involving the enrichment of $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th from the LS through acid extraction. With meticulous cleanliness control, $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th in approximately 2 kg of LS is concentrated by acid extraction with 0.4 (0.3) pg $^{238}$U ($^{232}$Th) contamination. Three standard adding methods are employed to assess recovery efficiency, including radon daughter, 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO), and natural non-existent $^{233}$U/$^{229}$Th. The method detection limit at a 99% confidence level of this approach can reach approximately 0.2-0.3 ppq for $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th with nearly 100% recovery efficiency.</description>

      <title>Nuclear rainbow of the symmetric nucleus-nucleus system: Interchange of the nearside and farside scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive elastic scattering data measured at energies around 10 to 20 MeV/nucleon for some identical systems, like 12C+12C and 16O+16O, exhibit the nuclear rainbow pattern of broad Airy oscillations of the cross section at medium and large angles. Due to the identity of the scattered projectile and recoiled target, the rainbow pattern at angles around and beyond $\theta_{\rm c.m.}\approx 90^\circ$ is strongly deteriorated by the boson exchange. The nuclear rainbow features in the identical-particles elastic scattering discussed so far are based on the nearside-farside (NF) decomposition of the scattering amplitude given by an optical model calculation neglecting the projectile-target exchange symmetry. Moreover, the NF decomposition method was developed in the 70s by Fuller for nonidentical systems only, and the details of how the exchange symmetry of an identical system affects the evolution of nuclear rainbow remain unexplored. Therefore, the Fuller method is generalized in this work for the elastic scattering of two identical (spin-zero) nuclei, with the projectile-target exchange symmetry taken explicitly into account. The results obtained for elastic 12C+12C and 16O+16O scattering at low energies show the exchange symmetry results in a symmetric interchange of the nearside and farside patterns at angles passing $\theta_{\rm c.m.}=90^\circ$, which requires a more subtle interpretation of nuclear rainbow. We also found that a similar NF interchange occurs in a nonidentical nucleus-nucleus system with the core-core symmetry, where the elastic cross section at backward angles is due mainly to the elastic transfer of cluster or nucleon between two identical cores. This interesting effect is illustrated in the elastic 16O+12C scattering at low energies where the elastic $\alpha$ transfer between two 12C cores has been proven to enhance the elastic cross section at backward angles.</description>

      <title>Solar fusion III: New data and theory for hydrogen-burning stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. Each of the relevant reactions of solar and quiescent stellar hydrogen burning is reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.</description>

      <title>Advances in the Large Area Picosecond Photo-Detector (LAPPD): 8" x 8" MCP-PMT with Capacitively Coupled Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present advances made in the Large Area Picosecond Photodetector (LAPPD), an 8" $\times$ 8" microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT), since pilot production was initiated at Incom, Inc. in 2018. The Gen-I LAPPD utilizes a stripline anode for direct charge readout. The novel Gen-II LAPPD employs an internal resistive thin-film which capacitively couples to a customizable external signal readout board, streamlining production. The Gen-II LAPPD, with an active area of 373 cm$^2$, is capable of high single photoelectron (PE) gain of $\sim$10$^7$, low dark rates ($\sim$1 kHz/cm$^2$), single PE timing resolution of $\sim$65 ps, and $\mathcal{O}$(mm) position resolution. Coupled with a UV-grade fused silica window, the LAPPD features a high quantum efficiency (QE) bialkali photocathode of $&gt;$30% with spectral response down to $\sim$165 nm. The LAPPD is an excellent candidate for electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) timing layers, photon-based neutrino detectors, high energy collider experiments, medical imaging systems, and nuclear non-proliferation applications.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $\Omega^0_{\rm c}$ baryon production and branching-fraction ratio ${\rm BR(\Omega^0_c \rightarrow \Omega^- e^+\nu_e)} / {\rm BR(\Omega^0_c \rightarrow \Omega^- \pi^+)}$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inclusive production of the charm-strange baryon $\Omega^{0}_{\rm c}$ is measured for the first time via its semileptonic decay into $\Omega^{-}\rm e^{+}\nu_{e}$ at midrapidity ($|y|&lt;0.8$) in proton$-$proton (pp) collisions at the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) differential cross section multiplied by the branching ratio is presented in the interval $2&lt;p_{\rm T}&lt;12~{\rm GeV}/c$. The branching-fraction ratio ${\rm BR}(\Omega^0_{\rm c} \rightarrow \Omega^{-}{\rm e}^{+}\nu_{\rm e})/ {\rm BR}(\Omega^0_{\rm c} \rightarrow \Omega^{-}{\pi}^{+})$ is measured to be 1.12 $\pm$ 0.22 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.27 (syst.). Comparisons with other experimental measurements, as well as with theoretical calculations, are presented.</description>
