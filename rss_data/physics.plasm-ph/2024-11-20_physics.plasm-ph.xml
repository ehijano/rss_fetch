      <title>On anomalous transport in the magnetic nozzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation to investigate the effects of anomalous diffusion on electron transport and the propulsive performance of magnetic nozzles (MN) typical of low-power cathode-less RF plasma thrusters. The analysis provides insights into how this non-collisional transport mechanism, driven by turbulence and wave-particle interactions, influences the formation of azimuthal electron currents and, consequently, impacts thrust generation, momentum/power balance, and propulsive efficiency metrics. A Bohm-type anomalous collisionality is applied to the case of a the 150 W class REGULUS-150-Xe thruster at low (30 W) and high (150 W) operating conditions. It is found that the enhanced cross-field transport of electrons inhibits the formation of the typical MN potential barrier, reducing the radial confinement. The downstream potential drop is reduced by up to 15%. Diamagnetic electron current is diminished in the absence of steep pressure gradients and the $E\times B$ current becomes purely paramagnetic. The MN efficiency is cut from circa 0.5 to 0.2 due to loss of electron thermal energy conversion and increased plume divergence. At the Bohm limit of $\omega_{ce}/16$, agreement to experimental thrust profiles of &lt;20% is achieved in contrast to 48% overestimation at high-power in the classical case.</description>

      <title>Analytical Description of Backward Stimulated Raman Scattering Short Pulse Gain factor for Gaussian and Square Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analytically compares the growth of Backward Stimulated Raman Scattering (B-SRS) induced by temporal laser pulses on the order of a few tens of laser cycles or a couple of picoseconds for nominally 10 um wavelength IR pulse with Gaussian versus the constant intensity profile assumed in the original theory, both delivering an equivalent energy. By evaluating the growth factors of these two pulse shapes, we demonstrate that the temporal structure of the laser pulse significantly influences the maximum growth rate of the instability. Specifically, while the growth rate for a square pulse increases linearly with time, the Gaussian pulse resultant growth rate tracks with the temporal intensity profile of the pulse. We utilize the newly calculated total maximum growth that a temporally varying pulse delivers above the B-SRS threshold and then determine the normalized intensity for a pulse that has same duration. and contains the same amount of total energy. We show that these energy equivalent square pulses yield the same total B-SRS growth as the Gaussian pulses.</description>

      <title>The neutron spectral moments method in the time-of-flight domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis methodology is developed for the time-of-flight (TOF) signals recorded by two or more collinear neutron detectors located at different distances from a pulsed neutron source. It is based on taking central moments of the TOF signals and relating these to a set of co-moments of the distribution of production times and velocities of neutrons emitted towards the detectors. Given n detectors, we can obtain all such co-moments of order n-1 and lower. Co-moments contain information on the time-varying behaviour of the neutron source. A physical interpretation is provided for several co-moments of interest.</description>

      <title>Single-fluid simulation of partially-ionized, non-ideal plasma facilitated by a tabulated equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a single-fluid approach for the simulation of partially-ionized plasmas (PIPs) which is designed to capture the non-ideal effects introduced by neutrals while remaining close in computational efficiency to single-fluid MHD. This is achieved using a model which treats the entire partially-ionized plasma as a single mixture, which renders internal ionization/recombination source terms unnecessary as both the charged and neutral species are part of the mixture's conservative system. Instead, the effects of ionization and the differing physics of the species are encapsulated as material properties of the mixture. Furthermore, the differing dynamics between the charged and neutral species is captured using a relative-velocity quantity, which impacts the bulk behavior of the mixture in a manner similar to the treatment of the ion-electron relative-velocity as current in MHD. Unlike fully-ionized plasmas, the species composition of a PIP changes rapidly with its thermodynamic state. This is captured through a look-up table referred to as the tabulated equation of state (TabEoS), which is constructed prior to runtime using empirical physicochemical databases and efficiently provides the ionization fraction and other material properties of the PIP specific to the thermodynamic state of each computational cell. Crucially, the use of TabEoS also allows our approach to self-consistently capture the non-linear feedback cycle between the PIP's macroscopic behavior and the microscopic physics of its internal particles, which is neglected in many fluid simulations of plasmas today.</description>

      <title>Energy balance for 6D kinetic ions with adiabatic electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the energy fluxes for the 6D kinetic Vlasov system. We introduce a novel method for calculating particle and energy flows within this framework which allows for the determination of energy and particle fluxes, as well as the Poynting flux, directly from the system's moments such as kinetic energy density, momentum transfer tensor. The fluxes computed using the new method exhibit fewer gyrooscillations. This approach also enables the identification of both the gyrokinetic $\vec{E} \times \vec{B}$ heat flux and additional non-gyrokinetic contributions, while simultaneously reducing inherent gyrooscillations in the energy and particle fluxes. Our semi-Lagrangian solver for the 6D kinetic Vlasov system, features a highly efficient scheme to address the $\vec v \times \vec B$ acceleration from the strong background magnetic field allows for the simulation of plasma waves and turbulence with frequencies extending beyond the cyclotron frequency, independent of gradient strength or fluctuation levels. The solver has been rigorously tested in the low-frequency regime for dispersion relations and energy fluxes in both linear and nonlinear scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear drift kinetic theory of alpha particle transport by neoclassical tearing modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic theory of particles near resonances is a current topic of discussion in plasma physics and astrophysics. We extend this discussion to the kinetic theory of the interaction between alpha particles (energetic particles predicted to exist in large quantities in next-generation fusion experiments) and a neoclassical tearing mode (NTM), a resistively-driven perturbation that sometimes exists in a tokamak. We develop a quasilinear treatment of the interaction between alphas and an NTM, showing why an NTM can be a source of significant passing alpha particle transport in tokamaks. The limitations on quasilinear theory constrain our theory's applicability to small amplitude NTMs, highlighting the importance of nonlinear studies.</description>

      <title>Transverse instability of electron-acoustic solitons in a relativistic degenerate astrophysical magnetoplasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear theory of small-amplitude electron-acoustic solitons (EASs) in a relativistic astrophysical magnetoplasma consisting of two-temperature electrons: a sparse population of relativistic nondegenerate classical electrons and a group of fully degenerate dense relativistic electrons (main constituent) immersed in a static magnetic field with a neutralizing stationary ion background. By using the multiple-scale reductive perturbation technique with the Lorentz transformation, the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov (mZK) equations are derived to describe the evolution of EASs in two different regimes of relativistic degeneracy: $r_{d0}&lt;50$ and $r_{d0}\gtrsim50$. The characteristics of the plane soliton solutions of ZK and mZK equations and the soliton energy are studied. We show that the solitons moving at an angle $\alpha$ to the external magnetic field can be unstable under transverse long-wavelength perturbations. The growth rates of instabilities are obtained and analyzed with the effects of the relativity parameter $\beta_{\rm{cl}}=k_BT_{\rm{cl}}/m_ec^2$ and the degeneracy parameter $r_{d0}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T_{\rm{cl}}$ is the temperature of classical electrons. Interestingly, the ZK solitons, even if it is stable for the first-order perturbations, can be unstable in the second-order correction. Furthermore, while the first-order growth rates of perturbations for ZK solitons tend to vanish as $\alpha\rightarrow 38^\circ$, that for the mZK soliton goes to zero as $\alpha\rightarrow 90^\circ$. However, depending on the angle $\alpha$, the growth rates are found to be reduced either by increasing the values of $\beta_{\rm{cl}}$ or by decreasing the values of $r_{d0}$. The applications of our results to astrophysical plasmas, such as those in the environments of white dwarfs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Coriolis Forces Modify Magnetostatic Ponderomotive Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is possible to produce a ponderomotive effect in a plasma system without time-varying fields, if the plasma flows over spatial oscillations in the field. This can be achieved by superimposing a spatially oscillatory perturbation on a guide field, then setting up an electric field perpendicular to the guide field to drive flow over the perturbation. However, subtle distinctions in the structure of the resulting electric field can entirely change the behavior of the resulting ponderomotive force. Previous work has shown that, in slab models, these distinctions can be explained in terms of the polarization of the effective wave that appears in the co-moving frame. Here we consider what happens to this picture in a cylindrical system, where the transformation to the co-moving (rotating) frame is not inertial. It turns out that the non-inertial nature of this frame transformation can lead to counterintuitive behavior, partly due to the appearance of parallel (magnetic-field-aligned) electric fields in the rotating frame even in cases where none existed in the laboratory frame. Apart from the academic interest of this study, the practical impact lies in being better able to anticipate the antenna configuration on the plasma periphery of a cylindrical plasma that will lead to optimal ponderomotive barrier formation in the interior plasma.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic parameterization of positive streamer heads in air</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of streamer discharges is determined at their heads, for individual streamers as well as in collective phenomena, such as streamer trees or coronas or streamer bursts ahead of lighting leaders. Some properties of the streamer heads, such as velocity $v$ and radius $R$ now can be measured quite well, but this is very challenging for others such as the maximal electric field, the charge content of the streamer head and the degree of chemical excitation and ionization in the streamer channel. Here we develop, test and evaluate a macroscopic approximation for positive streamer heads in air that relates macroscopic streamer head properties to each other. In particular, we find that velocity $v$, radius $R$ and background field $E_{\rm bg}$ determine the complete profile of streamer heads with photoionization, if they propagate steadily. We also review Naidis' approximate relation between $v$, $R$ and the maximal field $E_{\rm max}$. The approximate head model developed in the present paper consists of three first-order ordinary differential equations along the streamer axis. It is derived from the classical fluid model for streamer discharges by assuming axisymmetry, steady streamer propagation (i.e. with constant velocity and shape), and a spherical shape of the charge layer around the streamer head. The new reduced model agrees well with full solutions of the classical fluid model, even when it is applied to accelerating streamers. Therefore the model can be used for evaluations of experiments, like for the determination of the maximal electric field from radius and velocity of the streamer, and it is a step towards constructing reduced models for the collective dynamics of multi-streamer discharges.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning Based Reduced-Order Models for Plasma Turbulence Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates non-intrusive Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) for plasma turbulence simulations. In particular, we focus on Operator Inference (OpInf) to build low-cost physics-based ROMs from data for such simulations. As a representative example, we consider the (classical) Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations used for modeling two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence. For a comprehensive perspective of the potential of OpInf to construct predictive ROMs, we consider three setups for the HW equations by varying a key parameter, namely the adiabaticity coefficient. These setups lead to the formation of complex and nonlinear dynamics, which makes the construction of predictive ROMs of any kind challenging. We generate the training datasets by performing direct numerical simulations of the HW equations and recording the computed state data and outputs the over a time horizon of $100$ time units in the turbulent phase. We then use these datasets to construct OpInf ROMs for predictions over $400$ additional time units, that is, $400\%$ more than the training horizon. Our results show that the OpInf ROMs capture important statistical features of the turbulent dynamics and generalize beyond the training time horizon while reducing the computational effort of the high-fidelity simulation by up to five orders of magnitude. In the broader context of fusion research, this shows that non-intrusive SciML ROMs have the potential to drastically accelerate numerical studies, which can ultimately enable tasks such as the design of optimized fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Single-pulse Gy-scale irradiation of biological cells at $10^{13}$ Gy/s average dose-rates from a laser-wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the first experimental characterization of a laser-wakefield accelerator able to deliver, in a single pulse, doses in excess of \unit[1]{Gy} on timescales of the order of a hundred femtoseconds, reaching unprecedented average dose-rates up to \unit[10$^{13}$]{Gy/s}. The irradiator is demonstrated to deliver doses tuneable up to \unit[2.2]{Gy} in a cm$^2$ area and with a high degree of longitudinal and transverse uniformity in a single irradiation. In this regime, proof-of-principle irradiation of patient-derived glioblastoma stem-like cells and human skin fibroblast cells show indications of a differential cellular response, when compared to reference irradiations at conventional dose-rates. These include a statistically significant increase in relative biological effectiveness ($1.40\pm0.08$ at 50\% survival for both cell lines) and a significant reduction of the relative radioresistance of tumour cells. Data analysis provides preliminary indications that these effects might not be fully explained by induced oxygen depletion in the cells but may be instead linked to a higher complexity of the damages triggered by the ultra-high density of ionising tracks of femtosecond-scale radiation pulses. These results demonstrate an integrated platform for systematic radiobiological studies at unprecedented beam durations and dose-rates, a unique infrastructure for translational research in radiobiology at the femtosecond scale.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Hot Spots at Solar Coronal Loop Footpoints Revealed by Hyperspectral Imaging Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here we report high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.1\arcsec) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar H$\alpha$ line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as H$\alpha$ wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of $\sim$0.2\arcsec, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the H$\alpha$ wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the H$\alpha$ line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The H$\alpha$ wing integrated Stokes $V/I$ maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger than the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs. Therefore, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.</description>
