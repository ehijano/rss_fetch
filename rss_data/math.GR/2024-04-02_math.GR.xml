      <title>Finiteness properties of algebraic fibers of group extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey describes some recent work, by the authors and others, on the existence of algebraic fibrations of group extensions, as well as the finiteness properties of their algebraic fibers, in the realm of both abstract and pro-$p$ groups. We also discuss some applications of these results to (higher) coherence.</description>

      <title>Approximating hyperbolic lattices by cubulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that an isometric action of a torsion-free uniform lattice $\Gamma$ on hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$ can be metrically approximated by geometric actions of $\Gamma$ on $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ cube complexes, provided that either $n$ is at most three, or the lattice is arithmetic of simplest type. This solves a conjecture of Futer and Wise.
  Our main tool is the study of a space of co-geodesic currents, consisting of invariant Radon measures supported on codimension-1 hyperspheres in the Gromov boundary of $\mathbb{H}^n$. By pairing co-geodesic currents and geodesic currents via an intersection number, we show that asymptotic convergence of geometric actions can be deduced from the convergence of their dual co-geodesic currents.
  For surface groups, our methods also imply approximation by cubulations for actions induced by non-positively curved Riemannian surfaces with singularities, Hitchin and maximal representations, and quasiFuchsian representations.</description>

      <title>Hurewicz and Dranishnikov-Smith theorems for asymptotic dimension of countable approximate groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish two main results for the asymptotic dimension of countable approximate groups. The first one is a Hurewicz type formula for a global morphism of countable approximate groups $f:(\Xi, \Xi^\infty) \to (\Lambda, \Lambda^\infty)$, stating that $\mathrm{asdim} \Xi \leq \mathrm{asdim} \Lambda +\mathrm{asdim} ([\mathrm{ker} f]_c)$. This is analogous to the Dranishnikov-Smith result for groups, and is relying on another Hurewicz type formula we prove, using a 6-local morphism instead of a global one. The second result is similar to the Dranishnikov-Smith theorem stating that, for a countable group $G$, $\mathrm{asdim} G$ is equal to the supremum of asymptotic dimensions of finitely generated subgroups of $G$. Our version states that, if $(\Lambda, \Lambda^\infty)$ is a countable approximate group, then $\mathrm{asdim} \Lambda$ is equal to the supremum of asymptotic dimensions of approximate subgroups of finitely generated subgroups of $\Lambda^\infty$, with these approximate subgroups contained in $\Lambda^2$.</description>

      <title>Root Graded Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study root graded groups, that is, groups graded by finite root systems. This notion generalises several existing concepts in the literature, including in particular Jacques Tits' notion of RGD-systems. The most prominent examples of root graded groups are Chevalley groups over commutative associative rings. Our main result is that every root graded group of rank at least 3 is coordinatised by some algebraic structure satisfying a variation of the Chevalley commutator formula. This result can be regarded as a generalisation of Tits' classification of thick irreducible spherical buildings of rank at least 3 to the case of non-division algebraic structures. All coordinatisation results in this book are proven in a characteristic-free way. This is made possible by a new computational method that we call the blueprint technique.</description>

      <title>Symmetric mechanisms for two-sided matching problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the basic one-to-one two-sided matching model, where there are two disjoint sets of agents of equal size, and each agent in a set has preferences on the agents in the other set, modelled by linear orders. The goal is to find a matching that associates each agent in one set with one and only one agent in the other set based on the agents' preferences. A mechanism is a rule that associates a set of matchings to each preference profile. Stability, which refers to the capability to select only stable matchings, is an important property a mechanism should fulfill. Another crucial property, especially useful for applications, is resoluteness, which requires that the mechanism always selects a unique matching. The two versions of the deferred acceptance algorithm are examples of stable and resolute mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are severely unfair since they strongly favor one of the two sides of the market. In this paper, we introduce a property that mechanisms may meet which relates to fairness. Such property, called symmetry, is formulated in a way able to capture different levels of fairness within and across the two sets of agents and generalize existing notions. We prove several possibility and impossibility results, mainly involving the most general notion of symmetry, known as gender fairness: among others, a resolute and gender fair mechanism exists if and only if each side of the market consists of an odd number of agents; there exists no resolute, stable and gender fair mechanism.</description>

      <title>On the Algorithmic Recovering of Coefficients in Linearizable Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of recovering coefficients in scalar nonlinear ordinary differential equations that can be exactly linearized. This contribution builds upon prior work by Lyakhov, Gerdt, and Michels, which focused on obtaining a linearizability certificate through point transformations. Our focus is on quasi-linear equations, specifically those solved for the highest derivative with a rational dependence on the variables involved. Our novel algorithm for coefficient recovery relies on basic operations on Lie algebras, such as computing the derived algebra and the dimension of the symmetry algebra. This algorithmic approach is efficient, although finding the linearization transformation necessitates computing at least one solution of the corresponding Bluman-Kumei equation system.</description>

      <title>Limit pretrees for free group automorphisms: existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To any free group automorphism, we associate a real pretree with several nice properties. First, it has a rigid/non-nesting action of the free group with trivial arc stabilizers. Secondly, there is an expanding pretree-automorphism of the real pretree that represents the free group automorphism. Finally and crucially, the loxodromic elements are exactly those whose (conjugacy class) length grows exponentially under iteration of the automorphism; thus, the action on the real pretree is able to detect the growth type of an element.
  This construction extends the theory of metric trees that has been used to study free group automorphisms. The new idea is that one can equivariantly blow up an isometric action on a real tree with respect to other real trees and get a rigid action on a treelike structure known as a real pretree. Topology plays no role in this construction as all the work is done in the language of pretrees (intervals).</description>

      <title>Cayley Linear-Time Computable Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper looks at the class of groups admitting normal forms for which the right multiplication by a group element is computed in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine. We show that the groups $\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr \mathbb{Z}^2$, $\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr \mathbb{F}_2$ and Thompson's group $F$ have normal forms for which the right multiplication by a group element is computed in linear time on a $2$-tape Turing machine. This refines the results previously established by Elder and the authors that these groups are Cayley polynomial-time computable.</description>

Abstract: The small Davenport constant ${\mathsf{d}}(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is defined to be the maximal length of a sequence over $G$ which has no non-trivial product-one subsequence. In this paper, we prove that ${\mathsf{d}}(G) = 6$ for the non-abelian group of order $27$ and exponent $3$ and thereby establish a conjecture by Gao and Zhuang for this group.</description>

      <title>Reducible Suspensions of Anosov Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study through the lens of Anosov representations the dynamical properties of reducible suspensions of linear representations of non-elementary hyperbolic groups, which are linear representations preserving and acting weakly unipotently on a proper non-zero subspace. We characterize when reducible suspensions are discrete and (almost) faithful, quasi-isometrically embedded, and Anosov. Anosov reducible suspensions correspond to points in bounded convex domains in a finite-dimensional real vector space. Stronger characterizations of such domains for symmetric Anosov representations allow us to find deformations of Borel Anosov representations which retain some but not all of the Anosov conditions and to compute examples of non-Anosov limits of Anosov representations.</description>

Abstract: We construct two finite groups of size $2^{365}\cdot 3^{105}\cdot 7^{104}$: a solvable group $G$ and a non-solvable group $H$, such that for every integer $n$ the groups have the same number of elements of order $n$. This answers a question posed in 1987 by John G. Thompson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n\le 5$ be an integer, and let $\Gamma$ be a finite group. We prove that if $\rho , \rho': \Gamma \to O(n)$ are two representations that are conjugate by an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, then they are conjugate by an element of $SO(n)$. In the process, we prove that if $G \subset O(4)$ is a finite group, then exactly one of the following is true: the elements of $G$ have a common invariant $1$-dimensional subspace in $\mathbb{R}^4$; some element of $G$ has no invariant $1$-dimensional subspace; or $G$ is conjugate to a specific group $K \subset O(4)$ of order $16$.</description>

      <title>Topology and monoid representations I: Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to use topological methods to compute $\mathrm{Ext}$ between an irreducible representation of a finite monoid inflated from its group completion and one inflated from its group of units, or more generally coinduced from a maximal subgroup, via a spectral sequence that collapses on the $E_2$-page over fields of good characteristic.
  As an application, we determine the global dimension of the algebra of the monoid of all affine transformations of a vector space over a finite field. We provide a topological characterization of when a monoid homomorphism induces a homological epimorphism of monoid algebras and apply it to semidirect products. Topology is used to construct projective resolutions of modules inflated from the group completion for sufficiently nice monoids. A sequel paper will use these results to study the representation theory Hsiao's monoid of ordered $G$-partitions (connected to the Mantaci-Reutenauer descent algebra for the wreath product $G\wr S_n$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the general question of when all orbits under the unitary action of a finite group give a complex spherical design. Those orbits which have large stabilisers are then good candidates for being optimal complex spherical designs. This is done by developing the general theory of complex designs and associated (harmonic) Molien series for group actions. As an application, we give explicit constructions of some putatively optimal real and complex spherical t-designs.</description>
