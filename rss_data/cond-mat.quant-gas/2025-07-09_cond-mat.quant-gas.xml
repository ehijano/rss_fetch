      <title>Fast Coherent Splitting of Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparation of non-trivial quantum states without introducing unwanted excitations or decoherence remains a central challenge in utilizing ultracold atomic systems for quantum simulation. We employ optimal control methods to realize fast, coherent splitting of a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, achieving minimal classical excitations while preserving quantum correlations. Furthermore, we explore two-step protocols in which controlled classical motion is first induced and subsequently suppressed via tailored control sequences. Our experiments highlight the potential of optimal control for quantum state engineering and dynamical control in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Soliton and traveling wave solutions in coupled one-dimensional condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold condensates provide a unique platform for exploring soliton physics. Motivated by the recent experiments realizing the sine-Gordon model in a split one-dimensional (1D) BEC, we demonstrate that this system naturally supports various density and phase solitons. We explore the physics using the bosonization technique, in which the phase and density are conjugate pairs, and determine its effective Language equation and the associated equation of motion. We show that in the presence of asymmetry between the two condensates, new solutions beyond those in the sine-Gordon model emerge. We calculate the traveling wave solutions and soliton solutions in this model and determine their corresponding energy densities analytically. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these solutions to the experiments and discuss their observations. This theory does not rely on the mechanism of quasi-particle excitation, which yields the Lee-Huang-Yang correction in higher dimensions, and is thus much more suitable to describe the physics in 1D systems. Since the physical models have already been realized in experiments, this work opens a new frontier for the realization of various soliton and periodic solutions using two coupled condensates.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with ultracold simulators in lattice and ensemble systems: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing of parameters is an important aspect in all disciplines, with applications ranging from fundamental science to medicine. Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modelled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</description>

      <title>Algebraic States in Continuum in $ d\gt 1$ Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of algebraically localized eigenstates embedded within the continuum spectrum of 2D non-Hermitian systems with a single impurity. These modes, which we term algebraic states in continuum (AICs), decay algebraically as $1/|r|$ from the impurity site, and their energies lie within the bulk continuum spectrum under periodic boundary conditions. We analytically derive the threshold condition for the impurity strength required to generate such states. Remarkably, AICs are forbidden in Hermitian systems and in 1D non-Hermitian systems, making them unique to non-Hermitian systems in two and higher dimensions. To detect AICs, we introduce a local density of states as an experimental observable, which is readily accessible in photonic/acoustic platforms.</description>

      <title>A time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a topological superconductor in the presence of a time-reversal invariant vortex. The eigenmodes of the Bogoliubov-de-Genne (BdG) Hamiltonian show a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology: the time-reversal invariant vortex with odd winding number supports a pair of helical Majorana zero-modes at the vortex and the edge, while there is no such zero-modes when the winding number is even. We find that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ structure can be interpreted as an emergent gravitational effect. Identifying the gap function as spatial components of the vielbein in 2 +1-dimensional gravity theory, we can explicitly convert the BdG equation into the Dirac equation coupled to a nontrivial gravitational background. We find that the gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the fermionic spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity via layer differentiation in trilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with higher hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL is beneficial to the global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the picture that the IL itself can drive the $d$-wave superconductivity while the OLs only serve as the charge reservoir. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.</description>

      <title>Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be locally avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing open photon condensates by ghost-attractor dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the temporal, driven-dissipative dynamics of open photon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in a dye-filled microcavity, taking the condensate amplitude and the noncondensed fluctuations into account on the same footing by means of a cumulant expansion within the Lindblad formalism. The fluctuations fundamentally alter the dynamics in that the BEC always dephases to zero for sufficiently long time. However, a ghost-attractor, although it is outside of the physically accessible configuration space, attracts the dynamics and leads to a plateau-like stabilization of the BEC for an exponentially long time, consistent with experiments. We also show that the photon BEC and the lasing state are separated by a true phase transition, since they are characterized by different fixed points. The ghost-attractor nonequilibrium stabilization mechanism is alternative to prethermalization and may possibly be realized on other dynamical platforms as well.</description>

      <title>Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>
