      <title>The High W Challenge: Robust Neutrino Energy Estimators for LArTPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the neutrino energy is central to precision oscillation measurements. In this work, we introduce the W$^2$-based estimator, a new neutrino energy estimator based on the measurement of the final-state hadronic invatiant mass. This estimator is particularly designed to be employed in liquid-argon time-projection chambers exposed to broadband beams that span the challenging transition region between shallow inelastic scattering and deep inelastic scattering. The performance of the W$^2$-based estimator is compared against four other commonly used estimators. The impact of the estimator choice is evaluated by performing measurements of $\delta_{CP}$ and $\Delta m^2_{23}$ in a toy long-baseline oscillation analysis. We find that the W$^2$-based estimator shows the smallest bias as a funciton of true neutrino energy and it is particularly stable against the mismodelling of lepton scattering angle, missing energy, hadronic invariant mass and final state interactions. Such an inclusive channel complements well the strength of more exclusive methods that optimizes the energy resolution. By providing a detailed analysis of strengths, weaknesses and domain of applicability of each estimator, this work informs the combined used of energy estimators in any future LArTPC-based oscillation analysis.</description>

      <title>In-situ environmental radiation background measurement in the second phase of CJPL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), the deepest and largest underground laboratory worldwide, provides a low radiation background environment, which is necessary to frontier scientific research, such as the experimental studies of rare-event physics. Due to the almost filled space of CJPL-I and the requirement of future physics experiments, the construction of the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) was started in 2020 and all finished in 2024. In this work, we report the measured results of major environmental radiation in CJPL-II, including cosmic-ray muons, radon, gamma rays, and neutrons. Results indicate that the rock overburden and the radioactive background control effectively minimize the environmental radiation background. The scientific data presented also serve as an important basis to detector background modeling for the physics experiments in CJPL-II.</description>

      <title>Advanced Data Analysis of Spontaneous Biophoton Emission: A Multi-Method Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) from living systems is widely hypothesized to reflect un-derlying self-organization and long-range coordination in biological dynamics. However, distin-guishing biologically driven correlations from trivial stochastic or instrumental effects requires a robust, multi-method framework. In this work, we establish and benchmark a comprehensive anal-ysis pipeline for photon-count time series, combining Distribution Entropy Analysis, R\'enyi entro-py, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, its generalization Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, and tail-statistics characterization. Surrogate signals constructed from Poisson processes, Fractional Gaussian Noise, and Renewal Processes with power-law waiting times are used to validate sensitivity to memory, intermittency, and multifractality. Across all methods, a coherent hierarchy of dynamical regimes is recovered, demonstrating internal methodological consistency. Application to experimental dark-count data and attenuated coherent-laser emission confirm Poisson-like behavior, establishing an essential statistical baseline for UPE studies. The combined results show that this multi-resolution approach reliably separates trivial photon-counting statistics from struc-tured long-range organization, providing a validated methodological foundation for future biological UPE measurements and their interpretation in the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, information dynamics, and prospective markers of biological coherence.</description>

      <title>Quantum frequency resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In signal processing, resampling algorithms can modify the number of resources encoding a collection of data points. Downsampling reduces the cost of storage and communication, while upsampling interpolates new data from limited one, e.g. when resizing a digital image. We present a toolset of quantum algorithms to resample data encoded in the probabilities of a quantum register, using the quantum Fourier transform to adjust the number of high-frequency encoding qubits. We discuss advantage over classical resampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Neural Architecture: Online Attosecond X-ray Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of high-repetition-rate x-ray free-electron lasers, such as SLAC's LCLS-II, serve as our canonical example for autonomous controls that necessitate high-throughput diagnostics paired with streaming computational pipelines capable of single-shot analysis with extremely low latency. We present the Deterministic Characterization with an Integrated Parallelizable Hybrid Resolver architecture, a hybrid machine learning framework designed for fast, accurate analysis of XFEL diagnostics using angular streaking-based sinogram images. This architecture integrates convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory models to denoise input, identify x-ray sub-spike features, and extract sub-spike relative delays with sub-30 attosecond temporal resolution. Deployed on low-latency hardware, it achieves over 10~kHz throughput with \SI{168.3}{\micro\second} inference latency, indicating scalability to 14~kHz with FPGA integration. By transforming regression tasks into classification problems and leveraging optimized error encoding, we achieve high precision with low-latency performance that is critical for real-time streaming event selection and experimental control feedback signals. This represents a key development in real-time control pipelines for next-generation autonomous science, generally, and high repetition-rate x-ray experiments in particular.</description>
