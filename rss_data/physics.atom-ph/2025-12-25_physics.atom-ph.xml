      <title>Watt-class injection-locked diode laser system at 399 nm for atomic physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an injection-locked 399 nm laser system with up to 1 W output power and a locked power fraction of 0.57. The system consists of a high power, multimode diode laser that is seeded by 5 mW from a single-mode external cavity diode laser. The locked high-power laser inherits the frequency agility and linewidth of the seed laser with 3.9 kHz broadening. With active stabilization, the injection lock can be maintained for more than a day. We verify the utility of this system for atomic physics by performing spectroscopy of an ytterbium atomic beam.</description>

      <title>Acetaldehyde as a molecule for testing variations of electron-to-proton mass ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the quantum-mechanical calculations of the dimensionless sensitivity coefficients Q to small changes in the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - for a number of low-frequency (1-50 GHz) transitions of the acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) molecule. The calculations show that Q varies in the range from 0.62 to 3.61. An example of the practical use of the CH3CHO and CH3OH lines tracing the same regions in three molecular clouds, located at large galactocentric distances (D_GC ~ 8 kpc) is considered. This results in a limit on the mu variations of Delta mu/mu = (0.1 +/- 0.4)*10^(-7) which is in line with previously obtained most stringent upper limits on changes in mu based on other molecules and methods. The limit obtained restricts hypothetical violations of the Einstein principle of the local position invariance at the level of 4*10^(-8) in the Galactic disk at large galactocentric distances.</description>

      <title>AI-Accelerated Qubit Readout at the Single-Photon Level for Scalable Atomic Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state readout with minimal resources is crucial for scalable quantum information processing. As a leading platform, neutral atom arrays rely on atomic fluorescence imaging for qubit readout, requiring short exposure, low photon count schemes to mitigate heating and atom loss while enabling mid-circuit feedback. However, a fundamental challenge arises in the single-photon regime where severe overlap in state distributions causes conventional threshold discrimination to fail. Here, we report an AI-accelerated Bayesian inference method for fluorescence readout in neutral atom arrays. Our approach leverages Bayesian inference to achieve reliable state detection at the single-photon level under short exposure. Specifically, we introduce a weakly anchored Bayesian scheme that requires calibration of only one state, addressing asymmetric calibration challenges common across quantum platforms. Furthermore, acceleration is achieved via a permutation-invariant neural network, which yields a 100-fold speedup by compressing iterative inference into a single forward pass. The approach achieves relative readout fidelity above 99% and 98% for histogram overlaps of 61% and 72%, respectively, enabling reliable extraction of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference results unattainable with conventional threshold based methods. This framework supports scalable, real-time readout of large atom arrays and paves the way toward AI-enhanced quantum technology in computation and sensing.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant dynamically-decoupled hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy of ultra-narrow clock transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23091v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyper-Ramsey protocols effectively reduce AC-Stark shifts in probing ultra-narrow optical clock transitions but they remain sensitive to laser intensity noise, decoherence, frequency drifts, and low-frequency perturbations. We address these limitations by incorporating dynamical decoupling, using sequences of rotary Hahn-echo pulses that toggle the probe frequency detuning and phase between opposite signs. Implementing time-optimized Eulerian cycling circuits of multiple refocusing pulses, we generate high-contrast hyper-Ramsey interferences that are completely free from AC-Stark shifts and robust against environmental noise and laser probe parameters imperfections. We demonstrate the robustness of our dynamically-decoupled hyper-Ramsey interrogation scheme by implementing it directly at the pulse level on a superconducting quantum processing unit. Fault tolerant dynamically-decoupled SU(2) hyper-clocks are a significant step toward universal, noise resilient quantum sensors, enabling fault-tolerant metrology for searches about new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>
