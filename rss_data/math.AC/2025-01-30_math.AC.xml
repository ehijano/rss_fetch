      <title>Initial ideals of generic ideals and variations of Moreno-Soc\'{i}as conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the initial ideals of generic ideals are the same. Moreno-Soc\'{i}as conjectured that the initial ideal of generic ideals with respect to the degree reverse lexicographic order is weakly reverse lexicographic. In the first half of this paper, we study the initial ideal of generic ideals for arbitrary monomial order and prove that the initial ideal of generic ideals is Borel-fixed. It can be considered as a weakened version of Moreno-Soc\'{i}as conjecture. In the second half, we propose a new method of the computation of the initial ideal of generic ideals using stability condition of Gr\"{o}bner bases. We apply the method in the case of lexicographic order and study the relationship between the lexsegment ideal and the initial ideal of generic ideals. This study aims to bound the maximal degree of Gr\"{o}bner basis. At the last, we propose questions that can be considered as a lexicographic analogue of Moreno-Soc\'{i}as conjecture.</description>

      <title>Rational invariants of even degree polynomials under the orthogonal group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct a generating set of rational invariants for the action of the orthogonal group $\text{O}(n)$ on the space $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]_{2d}$ of real homogeneous polynomials of even degree $2d$. This generalizes a paper which addressed the case $n=3$. The main difficult with the generalization lies in a surprising connection to the graph isomorphism problem, a classical problem of computer science.</description>

      <title>White's conjecture for matroids and inner projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White's conjecture predicts quadratic generators for the ideal of any matroid base polytope. We prove that White's conjecture for any matroid $M$ implies it also for any matroid $M'$, where $M$ and $M'$ differ by one basis. Our study is motivated by inner projections of algebraic varieties.</description>

      <title>Jordan Type stratification of spaces of commuting nilpotent matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n\times n$ nilpotent matrix $B$ is determined up to conjugacy by a partition $P_B$ of $n$, its Jordan type given by the sizes of its Jordan blocks. The Jordan type $\mathfrak D(P)$ of a nilpotent matrix in the dense orbit of the nilpotent commutator of a given nilpotent matrix of Jordan type $P$ is stable - has parts differing pairwise by at least two - and was determined by R. Basili. The second two authors, with B. Van Steirteghem and R. Zhao determined a rectangular table of partitions $\mathfrak D^{-1}(Q)$ having a given stable partition $Q$ as the Jordan type of its maximum nilpotent commutator. They proposed a box conjecture, that would generalize the answer to stable partitions $Q$ having $\ell$ parts: it was proven recently by J.~Irving, T. Ko\v{s}ir and M. Mastnak.
  Using this result and also some tropical calculations, the authors here determine equations defining the loci of each partition in $\mathfrak D^{-1}(Q)$, when $Q$ is stable with two parts. The equations for each locus form a complete intersection. The authors propose a conjecture generalizing their result to arbitrary stable $Q$.</description>

      <title>The homological shift algebra of a monomial ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be the polynomial ring over a field $K$, and let $I\subset S$ be a monomial ideal. In this paper, we introduce the $i$th homological shift algebras $\text{HS}_i(\mathcal{R}(I))=S\oplus\bigoplus_{k\ge1}\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ of $I$. These algebras have the structure of a finitely generated bigraded module over the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I)$ of $I$. Hence, many invariants of $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$, such as depth, associated primes, regularity, and the $\text{v}$-number, exhibit well behaved asymptotic behavior. We particularly investigate $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ when $I$ has linear powers, and determine several families of monomial ideals $I$ for which $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ has linear resolution for all $k\gg0$. Finally, we show that $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ is Golod for all monomial ideals $I\subset S$ and all $k\gg0$.</description>

      <title>Edge ideals and their asymptotic syzygies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph, and let $I(G)$ denote its edge ideal. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the syzygies of powers of edge ideals through the lens of homological shift ideals $\text{HS}_i(I(G)^k)$. We introduce the notion of the $i$th homological strong persistence property for monomial ideals $I$, providing an algebraic characterization that ensures the chain of inclusions $\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I)\subseteq\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^2)\subseteq\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^3) \subseteq\cdots$. We prove that edge ideals possess both the 0th and 1st homological strong persistence properties. To this end, we explicitly describe the first homological shift algebra of $I(G)$ and show that $\text{HS}_1(I(G)^{k+1}) = I(G) \cdot \text{HS}_1(I(G)^k)$ for all $k \ge 1$. Finally, we conjecture that if $I(G)$ has a linear resolution, then $\text{HS}_i(I(G)^k)$ also has a linear resolution for all $k \gg 0$, and we present partial results supporting this conjecture.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial characterization of $S_2$ binomial edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several algebraic properties of a binomial edge ideal $J_G$ can be interpreted in terms of combinatorial properties of its associated graph $G$. In particular, the so-called cut sets of a graph $G$, special sets of vertices that disconnect $G$ in a minimal way, play an important role since they are in bijection with the minimal prime ideals of $J_G$. In this paper we establish the first graph-theoretical characterization of binomial edge ideals $J_G$ satisfying Serre's condition $(S_2)$ by proving that this is equivalent to having $G$ accessible, which means that $J_G$ is unmixed and the cut sets of $G$ form an accessible set system. The proof relies on the combinatorial structure of the Stanley-Reisner simplicial complex of a multigraded generic initial ideal of $J_G$, whose facets can be described in terms of cut sets. Another key step in the proof consists in proving the equivalence between accessibility and strong accessibility for the collection of cut sets of $G$ with $J_G$ unmixed. This result, interesting on its own, provides the first relevant class of set systems for which the previous two notions are equivalent.</description>
