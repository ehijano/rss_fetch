      <title>Unveiling the Dynamics and Genesis of Small-scale Fine Structure Loops in the Lower Solar Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution solar observations have unveiled the presence of small-scale loop-like structures in the lower solar atmosphere, often referred to as unresolved fine structures, low-lying loops, and miniature hot loops. These structures undergo rapid changes within minutes, and their formation mechanism has remained elusive. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of two small loops utilizing data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory, and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), aiming to elucidate the underlying process behind their formation. The GST observations revealed that these loops, with lengths of $\sim$3.5 Mm and heights of $\sim$1 Mm, manifest as bright emission structures in H$\alpha$ wing images, particularly prominent in the red wing. IRIS observations showcased these loops in 1330 angstrom slit-jaw images, with TR and chromospheric line spectra exhibiting significant enhancement and broadening above the loops, indicative of plasmoid-mediated reconnection during their formation. Additionally, we observed upward-erupting jets above these loops across various passbands. Furthermore, differential emission measurement analysis reveals an enhanced emission measure at the location of these loops, suggesting the presence of plasma exceeding 1 MK. Based on our observations, we propose that these loops and associated jets align with the minifilament eruption model. Our findings suggest a unified mechanism governing the formation of small-scale loops and jets akin to larger-scale X-ray jets.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of the red giant companions to Gaia BH2 and BH3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar companions in the binary black hole systems Gaia BH2 and BH3, both of which are $\alpha$-enhanced red giant branch stars, are expected to show normal modes with the characteristic signature of convectively-driven solar-like oscillations. We investigate this using photometry from the TESS mission and find such a signal for Gaia BH2. For Gaia BH2, we measure a power excess frequency of $\nu_{\rm max}=60.15\pm0.57$ $\mu$Hz and a large separation of $\Delta\nu=5.99\pm0.03$ $\mu$Hz, yielding a mass of $1.19^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ M$_\odot$, which is in agreement with spectroscopically derived parameters. Seismic modeling favors an age for the red giant of $5.03^{+2.58}_{-3.05}$ Gyr, strongly suggesting that it is a young, $\alpha$-enriched giant star, which are thought to arise from a binary accretion or merger scenario. Ground-based photometry of Gaia BH2 spanning 8 years indicates a photometric period of $398\pm5$ d, which we tentatively attribute to rotation. If this rotation is physical, it can not be explained solely by evolutionary spin-down or magnetic braking, and implies that the red giant underwent some tidal forcing mechanism. Suggestively, this period is close to the pseudo-synchronous spin period of P$_\text{spin}=428\pm1$ days derived from the binary orbit. For Gaia BH3, we are unable to identify an asteroseismic signal in the TESS data despite predicting that the amplitude of the signal should lie well above the measured noise level. We discuss a number of scenarios for why this signal may not be visible.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection to identify Transients in LSST Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to detecting microlensing events and other transients in light curves, utilising the isolation forest (iForest) algorithm for anomaly detection. Focusing on the Legacy Survey of Space and Time by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we show that an iForest trained on signal-less light curves can efficiently identify microlensing events by different types of dark objects and binaries, as well as variable stars. We further show that the iForest has real-time applicability through a drip-feed analysis, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for LSST alert brokers to efficiently prioritise and classify transient candidates for follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>The dearth of high-mass hydrogen-atmosphere metal-polluted white dwarfs within 40 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a population synthesis model which addresses the different mass distributions of the metal-polluted and non-metal-polluted hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs identified in volume-limited samples. Specifically, metal-pollution has been observed to be rare in white dwarfs more massive than $\approx$0.7 $M_{\odot}$. Our population synthesis model invokes episodic accretion of planetary debris onto a synthetic population of white dwarfs. We find that the observed difference can be explained in the regime where most debris disks last for $10^4$$-$$10^6$ years. This is broadly consistent with observational estimates that disk lifetimes are on the order 10$^5$$-$10$^7$ years. We also invoke an alternate model which explores an upper limit on planetary system formation and survival around the intermediate-mass progenitors of the more massive white dwarfs. In this scenario, we find an upper limit on the polluted white dwarf mass of $M_{\rm wd}&lt;0.72^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ M$_{\odot}$. This implies an empirical maximum progenitor mass of $M_{\rm ZAMS}^{\rm max}=2.9^{+0.7}_{-0.3}$ M$_{\odot}$. This value is consistent with the maximum reliable host star mass of currently known exoplanet systems. We conclude by imposing these two results on the sample of He-atmosphere white dwarfs within 40\,pc. We find that both scenarios are capable of providing a consistent solution to the full sample of H- and He-atmosphere white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Sun's open-closed flux boundary and the origin of slow solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun's open-closed flux boundary (OCB) separates closed and open magnetic field lines, and is the site for interchange magnetic reconnection processes thought to be linked to the origin of the slow solar wind (SSW). We analyse the global magnetic field structure and OCB from December 2010 to December 2019 using three coronal magnetic field models: a potential field source surface (PFSS) model, a static equilibrium magnetofrictional model, and a time-dependent magnetofrictional model. We analyse the model and cycle dependence of the OCB length on the photosphere, as well as the magnetic flux in the vicinity of the OCB. Near solar maximum, the coronal magnetic field for each model consists predominantly of long, narrow coronal holes, and nearly all the open flux lies within one supergranule-diameter (25 Mm) of the OCB. By comparing to interplanetary scintillation measurements of SSW speeds, we argue that the fraction of open flux within this 25 Mm band is a good predictor of the amount of SSW in the heliosphere. Importantly, despite its simplicity, we show that the PFSS model estimates this fraction as well as the time-dependent model. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding SSW origins and interchange reconnection at the OCB.</description>

      <title>A demarcation criterion for hydrogen burning of millinovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millinovae are a new class of transient supersoft X-ray sources with no clear signature of mass ejection. They show similar triangle shapes of $V/I$ band light curves with thousand times fainter peaks than typical classical novae. Maccarone et al. regarded the prototype millinova, ASASSN-16oh, as a dwarf nova and interpreted the supersoft X-rays to originate from an accretion belt on a white dwarf (WD). Kato et al. proposed a nova model induced by a high-rate mass-accretion during a dwarf nova outburst; the X-rays originate from the photosphere of a hydrogen-burning hot WD whereas the $V/I$ band photons are from the irradiated accretion disk. Because each peak brightness differs largely from millinova to millinova, we suspect that not all the millinova candidates host a hydrogen burning WD. Based on the light curve analysis of the classical nova KT Eri that has a bright disk, we find that the disk is more than two magnitudes brighter when the disk is irradiated by the hydrogen burning WD than when not irradiated. We present the demarcation criterion for hydrogen burning to be $I_{\rm q} - I_{\rm max} &gt; 2.2$, where $I_q$ and $I_{\rm max}$ are the $I$ magnitudes in quiescence and at maximum light, respectively. Among many candidates, this requirement is satisfied with the two millinovae in which soft X-rays were detected.</description>

      <title>3D non-LTE Ca II line formation in metal-poor FGK stars. I. Abundance corrections, radial velocity corrections, and synthetic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ca II resonance doublet (HK) and the near-infrared triplet (CaT) are among the strongest features in stellar spectra of FGK-type stars. These spectral lines remain prominent down to extremely low metallicities and are thus useful for providing stellar parameters via ionisation balance and as radial velocity diagnostics. However, the majority of studies that model these lines in late-type stars still rely on one dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We present 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations of the CaT and HK lines in an extended grid of 3D model atmospheres of metal-poor FGK-type. We investigate the impact of 3D non-LTE effects on abundances, line bisectors and radial velocities. We used a subset of 3D model atmospheres from the recently published STAGGER-grid to synthesize spectra in 3D (non-)LTE. For comparison, similar calculations were performed in 1D (non-)LTE using models from the MARCS grid. Abundance corrections for the CaT lines relative to 1D LTE range from +0.1 to -1.0 dex, with more severe corrections for strong lines in giants. With fixed line strength, the abundance corrections become more negative with increasing effective temperature and decreasing surface gravity. Radial velocity corrections relative to 1D LTE based on cross-correlation of the whole line profile range from -0.2 km/s to +1.5 km/s, with more severe corrections where the CaT lines are strongest. The corrections are even more severe if the line core alone is used to infer the radial velocity. The line strengths and shapes, and consequently the abundance and radial velocity corrections, are strongly affected by the chosen radiative transfer assumption, 1/3D (non)-LTE. We release grids of theoretical spectra that can be used to improve the accuracy of stellar spectroscopic analyses based on the Ca II triplet lines.</description>

      <title>Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS). VII. Circumstellar gas kinematics traced by water masers inside the HC HII region NGC7538 IRS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on NGC7538 IRS1, one of the most luminous and studied HC HII regions in the northern hemisphere. Our aim is to identify the young stellar objects (YSOs) embedded within the ionized gas and study their kinematic structures. This work expands on a recent survey called "Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages" (POETS), which has been devoted to studying young outflow emission on scales of 10-100 au near luminous YSOs, before they start photoionizing the surrounding medium. We carried out multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array observations of the 22 GHz water masers toward NGC7538 IRS1 to measure the maser 3D velocities, which, following POETS' findings, are reliable tracers of the protostellar winds. Recently, we reobserved the water masers in NGC7538 IRS1 with sensitive global very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations to map weaker maser emission. Our study confirms the presence of two embedded YSOs, IRS1a and IRS1b, at the center of the two linear distributions of 6.7 GHz methanol masers observed in the southern and northern cores of the HC HII region, which have been previously interpreted in terms of edge-on rotating disks. The water masers trace an extended (~200 au) stationary shock front adjacent to the inner portion of the disk around IRS1a. This shock front corresponds to the edge of the southern tip of the ionized core and might be produced by the interaction of the disk wind ejected from IRS1a with the infalling envelope. The water masers closer to IRS1b follow the same LSR velocity (Vlsr) pattern of the 6.7~GHz masers rotating in the disk, but the direction and amplitude of the water maser proper motions are inconsistent with rotation. We propose that these water masers are tracing a photo-evaporated disk wind, where the maser Vlsr traces mainly the disk rotation and the proper motions the poloidal velocity of the wind.</description>

      <title>Ionization memory of plasma emiters in a solar prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. In the low-collisional, partially ionized plasma (PIP) of solar prominences, uncharged emitters might show different signatures of magnetic line broadening than charged emitters. We investigate if the widths of weak metall emissions in prominences exceed the thermal line broadening by a different amount for charged and for uncharged emitters.
  Methods. We simultaneously observe five optically thin, weak metall lines in the brightness center of a quiescent prominence and compare their observed widths with the thermal broadening.
  Results. The inferred non-thermal broadening of the metall lines does not indicate systematic differences between the uncharged Mg b2 and Na D1 and the charged Fe II emitters, only Sr II is broader.
  Conclusions. The additional line broadening of charged emitters is reasonably attributed to magnetic forces. That of uncharged emitters can then come from their temporary state as ion before recombination. Magnetically induced velocities will retain some time after recombination. Modelling partially ionized plasmas then requires consideration of a memory of previous ionization states.</description>

      <title>Period-Luminosity Relations for Galactic Type II Cepheids in the Sloan bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II Cepheids (T2Ceps), alongside RR Lyrae stars, serve as important distance indicators for old population II stars due to their period-luminosity (PL) relations. However, studies of these relations in the Sloan photometric system are rather limited in the literature. Our goal is to calibrate PL relations (and their counterparts in Wesenheit magnitudes) in the Sloan-Pan-STARSS gP1rP1iP1 bands for Galactic T2Ceps located in the vicinity of the Sun. We collected data for 16 T2Ceps of the BLHer type and 17 of the WVir type using 40 cm telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Geometric parallaxes were adopted from Gaia Data Release 3. We have calibrated PL and period-Wesenheit relations for Milky Way BLHer and WVir stars in the solar neighborhood, as well as for a combined sample of both types. The relationships derived here will allow to determine the distances to T2Ceps that will be discovered by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time survey and, in turn, to probe the extended halo of the Milky Way, as well as the halos of nearby galaxies. To the best of our knowledge, the relations derived in this study are the first for Milky Way T2Ceps in the Sloan bands.</description>

      <title>Exploring the formation environment of multiple stellar populations in Globular Clusters through binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular Clusters (GCs) are known to host distinct stellar populations, characterized by different chemical compositions. Despite extensive research, the origin of these populations remains elusive. According to many formation scenarios, the second population (2P) originated within a compact and denser region embedded in a more extended first population (1P) system. As a result, 2P binaries should be disrupted at a larger rate than 1P binaries. For this reason, binary systems offer valuable insight into the environments in which these stellar populations formed and evolved. In this research, we analyze the fraction of binaries among 1P and 2P M dwarfs in the outer region of NGC 288 using Hubble Space Telescope data. We combine our results with those from a previous work, where we inferred the fraction of 1P and 2P binaries in the cluster center. In the outer region, we find a predominance of 1P binaries ($97^{+1}_{-3}\%$) compared to 2P binaries ($3\pm1\%$) corresponding to an incidence of binaries with a mass ratio (i.e., the ratio between the masses of the primary and secondary star) greater than 0.5 equal to $6.4\pm 1.7\%$ for the 1P population and $0.3\pm 0.2\%$ for the 2P population. These binary fractions and incidences differ from those found in the cluster$'$s central region, where the 1P and 2P populations exhibit similar binary incidences and fractions. These results are in general agreement with the predictions of simulations following the evolution of binary stars in multiple-population GCs, starting with a dense 2P subsystem concentrated in the central regions of a 1P system.</description>

      <title>R-JET: A postprocessing code for radiative transport in relativistic jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a post-processing radiative transport code for computing the spectra, the coreshift, and the surface-brightness distribution of special relativistic jets with arbitrary optical thickness. The jet consists of an electron-positron pair plasma and an electron-proton normal plasma. Electrons and positrons are relativistic and composed of thermal and nonthermal components, while protons are non-relativistic and non-radiating. The fraction of a pair plasma, as well as the fraction of a nonthermal component can be arbitrarily chosen. Only the synchrotron process is considered for emission and absorption when the radiative-transfer equation is integrated along our lines of sight. We describe a suite of test problems, and confirm the frequency dependence of the coreshift in the Konigl jet model, when the plasma is composed of nonthermal component alone. Finally, we illustrate the capabilities of the code with model calculations, demonstrating that the jet will exhibit a limb-brightened structure in general when it is energized by the rotational energy of the black hole. It is also demonstrated that such limb-brightened jets show a ring-like structure in the brightness map when we observe the jet launching region nearly face-on.</description>

      <title>Beyond monoculture: polydisperse moment methods for sub-stellar atmosphere cloud microphysics I. Examining properties of the exponential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational data provided by JWST instruments continue to challenge theories and models of cloud formation in sub-stellar atmospheres, requiring more sophisticated approaches in an effort to understand their spatial complexity. However, to date, most cloud microphysical models using the moment method for sub-stellar atmospheres have assumed a monodisperse size distribution, neglecting polydisperse properties. We aim to extend beyond the common assumption of a monodisperse size distribution and analyse cloud microphysical processes assuming an exponential distribution. We derive expressions for the zeroth and first moments of condensation/evaporation and collisional growth processes under the assumption of an exponential size distribution. We then compare the differences between monodisperse and exponential distribution microphysics using a simple one-dimensional (1D) column model applied to a Y-dwarf KCl cloud scenario. We find that adopting an exponential distribution modifies condensation/evaporation rates by a factor of $\approx$0.9 and collisional growth rates by factors of $\approx$1.1 (Kn $\ll$ 1) and $\approx$0.92 (Kn $\gg$ 1) for Brownian coagulation and $\approx$0.85 for gravitational coalescence, compared to the monodisperse case. In our specific test cases, we find relative differences of a maximum 10-12% in total number density and 2-3% in mean radius of the cloud particles between the monodisperse and exponential distributions. Our results offer a simple way to take into account an assumed exponential size distribution for sub-stellar atmospheric cloud microphysics using the two-moment method. In follow up studies, we will examine more complex distributions, such as the log-normal and gamma distributions, that require more than two moments to characterise self-consistently.</description>

      <title>Simulating the shaping of point-symmetric structures in the jittering jets explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of core-collapse supernovae by launching several pairs of jets into a collapsing core model and show that the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) can form a point-symmetric morphology that accounts for observed morphologies of many core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) remnants. Point-symmetric morphologies are composed of pairs of opposite structures around the center of the CCSN remnant. In the JJEM, the newly born neutron star launches several to a few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions, and these jets explode the star. In the simulations with the FLASH numerical code, we launch pairs of jets with varying directions, energies, opening angles, and durations into the massive stellar core and follow their evolution for about two seconds. We show that the jets form pairs of opposite filaments, clumps, bubbles, and lobes, namely, prominent point-symmetric morphologies. The interaction of the jets with the core leads to vigorous Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and excites many vortices, which also shape clumps and filaments. Our results strengthen the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>C3PO IV: co-natal stars depleted in refractories are magnetically more active -- possible imprints of planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical abundance anomalies in twin stars have recently been considered tell-tale signs of interactions between stars and planets. While such signals are prevalent, their nature remains a subject of debate. On one hand, exoplanet formation may induce chemical depletion in host stars by locking up refractory elements. On the other hand, exoplanet engulfment can result in chemical enrichment, both processes potentially producing similar differential signals. In this study, we aim to observationally disentangle these processes by using the Ca II infrared triplet to measure the magnetic activity of 125 co-moving star pairs with high SNR, high-resolution spectra from the Magellan, Keck, and VLT telescopes. We find that co-natal star pairs in which the two stars exhibit significant chemical abundance differences also show differences in their magnetic activity, with stars depleted in refractories being magnetically more active. Furthermore, the strength of this correlation between differential chemical abundances and differential magnetic activity increases with condensation temperature. One possible explanation is that the chemical anomaly signature may be linked to planet formation, wherein refractory elements are locked into planets, and the host stars become more active due to more efficient contraction during the pre-main-sequence phase or star-planet tidal and magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Observations of Pickup Ion Mediated Shocks to 60 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a detailed analysis of fourteen distant interplanetary shocks observed by the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument onboard New Horizons. These shocks were observed with a pickup ion data cadence of approximately 30 minutes, covering a heliocentric distance range of ~52-60 au. All the shocks observed within this distance range are fast-forward shocks, and the shock compression ratios vary between ~1.2 and 1.9. The shock transition scales are generally narrow, and the SW density compressions are more pronounced compared to the previous study of seven shocks by McComas et al. (2022). A majority (64%) of these shocks have upstream sonic Mach numbers greater than one. In addition, all high-resolution measurements of distant interplanetary shocks analyzed here show that the shock transition scale is independent of the shock compression ratio. However, the shock transition scale is strongly anti-correlated with the shock speed in the upstream plasma frame, meaning that faster shocks generally yield sharper transitions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of methods used to derive the Galactic star formation history from white dwarf samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare three methods of deriving the local Galactic star formation history, using as a benchmark the Gaia-defined 40 pc white dwarf sample, currently the largest volume complete sample of stellar remnants with medium-resolution spectroscopy. We create a population synthesis model to 1) reproduce the observed white dwarf luminosity function, 2) reproduce the observed absolute Gaia G magnitude distribution, and 3) directly calculate the ages of all individual white dwarfs in the 40 pc volume. We then compare the star formation histories determined from each method. Previous studies using these methods were based on different white dwarf samples and as such were difficult to compare. Uncertainties in each method such as the initial mass function, initial-final mass relation, main sequence lifetimes, stellar metallicity, white dwarf cooling ages and binary evolution are accounted for to estimate the precision and accuracy of each method. We conclude that no method is quantitatively better at determining the star formation history and all three produce star formation histories that agree within uncertainties of current external astrophysical relations.</description>

      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST: II. Observations of an Eta Carinae Analog at $z=2.37$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Godzilla" is a peculiar object within the gravitationally lensed Sunburst Arc at $z=2.37$. Despite being very bright, it appears in only one of the twelve lensed images of the source galaxy, and shows exotic spectroscopic properties not found in any other clumps. We use JWST's unique combination of spatial resolution and spectroscopic sensitivity to provide a unified, coherent explanation of the physical nature of Godzilla. We measure fluxes and kinematic properties of rest-optical emission lines in Godzilla and surrounding regions. Using standard line ratio-based diagnostic methods in combination with NIRCam imaging and ground based rest-UV spectra, we characterize Godzilla and its surroundings. Among around 60 detected lines, we find a cascade of strong O I lines pumped by intense Ly$\beta$ emission, as well as Ly$\alpha$-pumped rest-optical Fe II lines, reminiscent of the Weigelt blobs in the local LBV star Eta Carinae. Spectra and images of Godzilla and two faint adjacent images, and the detection of a low-surface brightness foreground galaxy in the NIRCam data, support the interpretation that Godzilla is an extremely magnified object due to the alignment with lensing caustics. We find that Godzilla is part of a previously identified clump, comprising $\sim10 - 25$ % of it, with magnifications in the range of $\approx600-25,000$ depending on the models and images in comparison. The unique O I source in Godzilla is well explained by a non-erupting LBV accompanied by a hotter companion and/or gas condensations exposed to more intense radiation compared to the Weigelt blobs. If Godzilla is confirmed to contain an LBV star, it expands the distance to the furthest known LBV from a dozen Mpc to several Gpc.</description>
