      <title>Path-dependency and emergent computing under vectorial driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequential response of frustrated materials - ranging from crumpled sheets and amorphous media to metamaterials - reveals their memory effects and emergent computational potential. Despite their spatial extension, most studies rely on a single global stimulus, such as compression, effectively reducing the problem to scalar driving. Here, we introduce vectorial driving by applying multiple spatially localized stimuli to explore path-dependent, sequential responses. We uncover a wealth of phenomena absent in scalar driving, including non-Abelian responses, mixed-mode behavior, and chiral loop transients. We find that such path dependencies arise from elementary motifs linked to fold singularities, which connect triplets of states - ancestor, descendant, and sibling; and develop a general framework using pt-graphs to describe responses under any vectorial driving protocol. Leveraging binarized vectorial driving, we establish a natural connection to computation, showing that a single sample can encode multiple sequential Boolean circuits, which are selectable by driving strength and reprogrammable via additional inputs. Finally, we introduce graph-based motifs to manage the complexity of high-dimensional driving. Our work paves the way for strategies to explore, harness, and understand complex materials and memory, while advancing embodied intelligence and in-materia computing.</description>

      <title>Directional Locking and Hysteresis in Stripe and Bubble Forming Systems on One-Dimensional Periodic Substrates with a Rotating Drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of a two-dimensional stripe, bubble, and crystal forming system interacting with a periodic one-dimensional substrate under an applied drive that is rotated with respect to the substrate periodicity direction $x$. We find that the stripes remain strongly directionally locked to the $x$ direction for an extended range of drives before undergoing motion parallel to the drive. In some cases, the stripes break apart at the unlocking transition, but can dynamically reform into stripes aligned perpendicular to the $x$ direction, producing hysteresis in the directional locking and unlocking transitions. In contrast, moving anisotropic crystal and bubble phases exhibit weaker directional locking and reduced or no hysteresis. The hysteresis occurs in regimes where the particle rearrangements occur and is most pronounced near the stripe phase. We also show that for varied substrate strength, substrate spacing, and particle density, a number of novel dynamical patterns can form that include a combination of stripe, bubble, and crystal morphologies.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Size and Stiffness of Inflatable Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe size-varying cylindrical particles made from silicone elastomers that can serve as building blocks for robotic granular materials. The particle size variation, which is achieved by inflation, gives rise to changes in stiffness under compression. We design and fabricate inflatable particles that can become stiffer or softer during inflation, depending on key parameters of the particle geometry, such as the ratio of the fillet radius to the wall thickness, r/t. We also conduct numerical simulations of the inflatable particles and show that they only soften during inflation when localization of large strains occurs in the regime r/t -&gt; 0. This work introduces novel particle systems with tunable size and stiffness that can be implemented in numerous soft robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Sergeants and Soldiers in Chiral Nematic Liquid Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the mechanisms behind the helical structures in cholesteric liquid crystalline (CLC) phases using molecular dynamics simulations. By adding chiral agents to the nematic liquid crystalline (NLC) compound, 5CB, the research examines how the shape and motion chirality of the agents influence the overall twisting behavior. The results show that chiral agents induce shape chirality in the 5CB molecules, but dynamic chirality is not detectable at this stage. The study suggests that equilibrium is required for motion chirality to become evident, highlighting the need for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Interaction and Geometric Memory Effect Drive Directed Swimming of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii near Periodic Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movement of microorganisms near solid-liquid interfaces is a topic of significant scientific interest due to its relevance in various natural and industrial contexts, such as biofilm formation and marine biofouling. In this study, we investigate the swimming behavior of C. reinhardtii near a sinusoidal periodic microstructure (SPM). Using fluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional tracking, we observe that the swimming direction of C. reinhardtii is strongly influenced by the geometric constraints of the SPM. Our results show that cells tend to aggregate at the bottom of the SPM rather than the top, and exhibit a speed orientation tendency near the microstructure. We attribute this behavior to a combination of the "memory effect" and hydrodynamic attraction. By altering the shape of the periodic microstructure, we successfully achieve directed induction of cell swimming, which has potential applications in micro-nano robot control and biofouling prevention. This work provides new insights into the movement mechanisms of microorganisms near solid-liquid surfaces and highlights the potential for manipulating their behavior through microstructure design.</description>

      <title>Shear-Rate Dependent Surface Tension of Glass-Forming Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interface of a glass-forming fluid showing non-Newtonian rheology. By applying shear flow in the interface, we detect that the surface tension depends on the shear rate. Importantly, the standard way of determining surface tension from the pressure drop across the interface gives rise to an effective surface tension in the non-Newtonian fluid that mixes bulk and interface properties. We show how the pressure anisotropy can be used to clearly define the bulk and interface regions and extract a genuine shear-rate dependent surface tension. The results have implications for measurement techniques related to interfacial rheology of complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Elastic Plateau-Rayleigh instability in soft cylinders: Surface elasticity and periodic beading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Plateau-Rayleigh instability shows that a cylindrical fluid flow can be destabilized by surface tension. Similarly, capillary forces can make an elastic cylinder unstable when the elastocapillary length is comparable to the cylinder's radius. While existing models predict a single isolated bulge as the result of an instability, experiments reveal a periodic sequence of bulges spaced out by thinned regions, a phenomenon known as beading instability. Most models assume that surface tension is independent of the deformation of the solid, neglecting variations due to surface stretch.
  In this work, we assume that surface tension arises from the deformation of material particles near the free surface, treating it as a pre-stretched elastic surface surrounding the body. Using the theoretical framework proposed by Gurtin and Murdoch, we show that a cylindrical solid can undergo a mechanical instability with a finite critical wavelength if the body is sufficiently soft or axially stretched. Post-buckling numerical simulations reveal a morphology in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Period-halving secondary bifurcations are also observed. The results of this research have broad implications for soft materials, biomechanics, and microfabrication applications where surface tension plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Heat-to-motion conversion for quantum active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of an active quantum particle and discuss its properties. The particle has a set of internal states that mediate exchanges of heat with external reservoirs. Heat is then converted into motion by means of a spin-orbit term that couples internal and translational degrees of freedom. The quantum features of the active particle manifest both in the motion and in the heat-to-motion conversion. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of heat exchanges impacts the motion of the active particle and fluctuations can be orders of magnitude larger than the average values. The combination of spin-orbit interaction under nonequilibrium driving may bring active matter into the realm of cold atomic gases where our proposal can be implemented.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard Convection with Phase Change Close to the Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection is investigated with sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_6$) in the vicinity of its critical point. In the supercritical domain, direct measurements of the heat flux $Q$ as a function of the temperature difference $\Delta T$ are consistent with the usual scaling laws of single-phase turbulent convection. Along the liquid-vapor coexistence curve, heat fluxes are dramatically enhanced by condensation and boiling. Optical measurements are performed to document the size and velocity of the bubbles. We report $Q(\Delta T, \epsilon)$ in both domains, with $\epsilon$ the dimensionless distance to the critical point. Critical scaling laws are observed that can guide the development of theoretical models. In addition, this documents a system of diverging heat transfer coefficient, i.e., in which a significant heat flux can be achieved with an arbitrarily small temperature difference as $\epsilon\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The underlying structural disorder renders the concept of topological defects in amorphous solids difficult to apply and hinders a first-principle identification of the microscopic carriers of plasticity and of the regions more prone to structural rearrangements (``soft spots''). Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects can still be identified in glasses, and correlated to local and global plasticity, by looking at the eigenvector field or the particle displacement field. Nevertheless, all the existing proposals and analyses are only valid in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose the idea of using hedgehog topological defects to characterize the plasticity of 3D glasses and to geometrically predict the location of their soft spots. We corroborate our proposal by simulating a Kremer-Grest 3D polymer glass, and by using both the normal mode eigenvector field and the displacement field around large plastic events. Contrary to the 2D case, the sign of the topological charge defined from the eigenvector field is ambiguous and the geometry of the topological defects, whether radial or hyperbolic, plays a fundamental role in 3D. In fact, we find that the topological hedgehog defects relevant for plasticity are those exhibiting hyperbolic geometry, resembling the saddle-point structure of 2D topological defects with negative winding number (anti-vortices). Our results confirm that a topological characterization of plasticity in glasses is feasible and provide a concrete realization of this program in 3D amorphous systems.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of run-and-tumble-like dynamics in coupled self-propelled robots: experiment and theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble (RT) motion is commonly observed in flagellated microswimmers, arising from synchronous and asynchronous flagellar beating. In addition to hydrodynamic interactions, mechanical coupling has recently been recognized to play a key role in flagellar synchronization. To explore this, we design a macroscopic model system that comprises dry, self-propelled robots linked by a rigid rod to model a biflagellated microorganism. To mimic a low Reynolds number environment, we program each robot to undergo overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion. We find that such a system exhibits RT-like behavior, characterized by sharp tumbles and exponentially distributed run times, consistent with real microswimmers. We quantify tumbling frequency and demonstrate its tunability across experimental parameters. Additionally, we provide a theoretical model that reproduces our results, elucidating physical mechanisms governing RT dynamics.</description>

      <title>Particle Geometry Space: An integrated characterization of particle shape, surface area, volume, specific surface, and size distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that govern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of particle size and shape has often been examined in isolation, typically through separate analyses of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to an unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also includes attributes such as surface area and volume, which together defines the surface-area-to-volume ratio, commonly known as the specific surface. To comprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior of granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally into a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new approach, particle geometry space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that the key 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, and shape - can be uniformly expressed as a function of specific surface. The PGS not only encompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by integrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and researchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic characterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the limitations of existing methods for characterizing 3D particle geometry, (ii) offers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into the PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral particle geometry data.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Mechanics of Non-Euclidean Curved-Crease Origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently there have been extensive theoretical, numerical and experimental works on curved-fold origami. However, we notice that a unified and complete geometric framework for describing the geometry and mechanics of curved-fold origami, especially those with nontrivial Gaussian curvature at the crease (non-Euclidean crease), is still absent. Herein we provide a unified geometric framework that describes the shape of a generic curved-fold origami composed of two general strips. The explicit description indicates that four configurations emerge, determined by its spatial crease and configuration branch. Within this geometric framework, we derive the equilibrium equations and study the mechanical response of the curved-crease origami, focusing on Euler's buckling behavior. Both linear stability analysis and finite element simulation indicate that the overlaid configuration exhibits a lower buckling threshold. To further capture the large deformation behavior efficiently, we develop a bistrip model based on the anisotropic Kirchhoff rod theory, which predicts the main features successfully. This work bridges the geometry and mechanics of curved-crease origami, offering insights for applications in robotics, actuators, and deployable space structures.</description>
