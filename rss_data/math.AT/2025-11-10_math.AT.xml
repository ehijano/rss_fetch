      <title>Every Endomorphism of the Framed Little Disk Operad is an Automorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Horel-Krannich-Kupers proved that all endomorphisms of the little $d$-disk operad are automorphisms. In this paper we show that this is also true for the framed little $d$-disk operad by using the classification of self maps of simple Lie groups. We also examine whether this property holds for the swiss cheese operad and prove that it holds for some other semidirect products of a group with a little disk operad.</description>

      <title>Open-Closed Hochschild Homology and the Relative Disk Mapping Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a model for the differential graded algebra (dga) of differential forms on the free loop space $LN$ of a simply connected smooth manifold $N$ is given by the Hochschild chain complex of the dga $\Omega(N)$ of differential forms on $N$, as shown by K.-T. Chen via his theory of iterated integrals. We develop a relative version of Chen's model. Given a smooth map $f\colon N\to M$ between smooth manifolds, we consider the ``relative disk mapping space'' consisting of pairs $(\Phi,\gamma)$ of maps $\Phi\colon \mathbb D\to M$ and $\gamma\colon S^1\to N$ such that $\Phi|_{\partial\mathbb D}=f\circ\gamma$. We construct iterated integral models for this mapping space through an open-closed homotopy algebra (OCHA) naturally associated to $f$ and the theory of open-closed Hochschild homology, which may be of independent interest. Our main theorem states that the resulting map is a quasi-isomorphism when $M$ is contractible or 2-connected with the rational homotopy type of an odd sphere, and $N$ is simply connected. This result generalizes Chen's classical theorem for free loop spaces and, in the above special cases, extends the theorem of Getzler-Jones for double loop spaces.</description>

      <title>Persistent reachability homology in machine learning applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the recently introduced persistent reachability homology (PRH) of digraph data, i.e. data in the form of directed graphs. In particular, we study the effectiveness of PRH in network classification task in a key neuroscience problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support vector machine.</description>

      <title>Hall's theorem for reconfigurations and higher dimensional topological connectedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One widely applied sufficient condition for the existence of a colorful simplex in a vertex-colored simplicial complex is a topological extension of Hall's transversal theorem due to Aharoni, Haxell, and Meshulam. We prove a similar topological Hall theorem that provides a sufficient condition for being able to transform any colorful simplex into any other through a sequence of one-vertex swaps while always maintaining a colorful simplex, meaning that the associated reconfiguration graph is connected. In fact, we prove a generalized topological Hall theorem about the homological connectedness of the space of colorful simplices, as well as a matroidal generalization of this result. We deduce sufficient conditions for reconfiguration graphs to be connected for various combinatorial structures of interest such as independent transversals in graphs, matchings in bipartite hypergraphs, and intersections of matroids. In particular, we give an alternative proof of a maximum degree condition for independent transversal reconfigurability by Buys, Kang, and Ozeki. We also deduce tight reconfiguration versions of the colorful Helly, colorful Carath\'eodory, and Tverberg theorems from discrete geometry, confirming a conjecture of Oliveros, Rold\'an, Sober\'on, and Torres.</description>

      <title>Lie algebra homology with coefficients tensor products of the adjoint representation in relative polynomial degree 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homology of free Lie algebras with coefficients in tensor products of the adjoint representation working over Q contains important information on the homological properties of polynomial outer functors on free groups. The latter category was introduced in joint work with Vespa, motivated by the study of higher Hochschild homology of wedges of circles.
  There is a splitting of this homology by polynomial degree (for polynomiality with respect to the generators of the free Lie algebra) and one can consider the polynomial degree relative to the number of tensor factors in the coefficients. It suffices to consider the Lie algebra homology in homological degree one; this vanishes in relative degree 0 and is readily calculated in relative degree 1.
  This paper calculates the homology in relative degree 2, which presents interesting features. This confirms a conjecture of Gadish and Hainaut.</description>
