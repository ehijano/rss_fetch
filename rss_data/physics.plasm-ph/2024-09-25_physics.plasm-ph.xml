      <title>Self-mediation of runaway electrons via self-excited wave-wave and wave-particle interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics of runaway electron induced wave instabilities can significantly modify the runaway distribution critical to tokamak operations. Here we present the first-ever fully kinetic simulations of runaway-driven instabilities towards nonlinear saturation in a warm plasma as in tokamak start up. It is found that the slow-X modes grow an order of magnitude faster than the whistler modes, and they parametrically decay to produce whistlers much faster than those directly driven by runaways. These parent-daughter waves, as well as secondary and tertiary wave instabilities, initiate a chain of wave-particle resonances that strongly diffuse runaways to the backward direction. This reduces almost half of the current carried by high-energy runaways, over a time scale orders of magnitude faster than experimental shot duration. These results beyond quasilinear analysis may impact anisotropic energetic electrons broadly in laboratory, space and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Modified Bridgman formula for the thermal conductivity of complex (dusty) plasma fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple and popular Bridgman's formula predicts a linear correlation between the thermal conductivity coefficient and the sound velocity of dense liquids. Unfortunately, it cannot be applied to strongly coupled plasma-related fluids, because the sound velocity can greatly increase as screening weakens. We propose a modification of the Bridgman formula by correlating the thermal conductivity coefficient with the transverse (shear) sound velocity. This approach is demonstrated to work reasonably well in screened Coulomb (Yukawa) fluids and can be useful in the context of complex (dusty) plasmas.</description>

      <title>Laboratorial radiative shocks with multiple parameters and first quantifying verifications to core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experiments to reproduce the characteristics of core-collapse supernovae with different stellar masses and initial explosion energies in the laboratory. In the experiments, shocks are driven in 1.2 atm and 1.9 atm xenon gas by laser with energy from 1600J to 2800J on the SGIII prototype laser facility. The average shock velocities and shocked densities are obtained from experiments. Experimental results reveal that higher laser energy and lower Xe gas density led to higher shock velocity, and lower Xe gas initial density has a higher compression. Modeling of the experiments using the 2D radiation hydrodynamic codes Icefire shows excellent agreement with the experimental results and gives the temperature. These results will contribute to time-domain astrophysical systems, such as gravitational supernovae, where a strong radiative shock propagates outward from the center of the star after the core collapses.</description>

      <title>Coherence of Multi-Dimensional Pair Production Discharges in Polar Caps of Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first self-consistent multidimensional particle-in-cell numerical simulations of non-homogeneous pair discharges in polar caps of rotation-powered pulsars. By introducing strong inhomogeneities in the initial plasma distribution in our simulations, we analyze the degree of self-consistently emerging coherence of discharges across magnetic field lines. In 2D, we study discharge evolution for a wide range of physical parameters and boundary conditions corresponding to both the absent and free escape of charged particles from the surface of a neutron star. We also present the results of the first 3D simulations of discharges in a polar cap with a distribution of the global magnetospheric current appropriate for a pulsar with $60^{\circ}$ inclination angle. For all parameters, we find the coherence scale of pair discharges across magnetic field lines to be of the order of gap height. We also demonstrate that the popular "spark" model of pair discharges is incompatible with the universally adopted force-free magnetosphere model: intermittent discharges fill the entire zone of the polar cap that allows pair cascades, leaving no space for discharge-free regions. Our findings disprove the key assumption of the spark model about the existence of isolated distinct discharge columns.</description>

      <title>Use of current-potential patches to obtain fundamental improvements to the coils of magnetic fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19123v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central issue in the design of tokamaks or stellarators is the coils that produce the external magnetic fields. The freedom that remains unstudied in the design of coils is enormous. This freedom could be quickly studied computationally at low cost with high reliability. In particular, the space between toroidal field or modular coils that block access to the plasma chamber could be increased by a large factor. The concept of current-potential patches, which was developed in Todd Elder's thesis, provides a method for separating the study of the feasibility of coils with attractive physics properties from the engineering design of specific coils. In addition to enhanced accessibility, coils can be designed for increased plasma-coil separation, insensitivity to coil position errors, and plasma control.</description>

      <title>On the importance of separators as sites of 3D magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For 3D magnetic reconnection to occur there must exist a volume within which the electric field component parallel to the magnetic field is non-zero. In numerical experiments, locations of non-zero parallel electric field indicate sites of 3D magnetic reconnection. If these experiments contain all types of topological feature (null points, separatrix surfaces, spines and separators) then comparing topological features with the reconnection sites reveals that all the reconnection sites are threaded by separators with the local maxima/minima of the integrated parallel electric along fieldlines coinciding with these separators. However, not all separators thread a reconnection site. Furthermore, there are different types of separator. Cluster separators are short arising within an individual weak magnetic field region and have negligible parallel electric field along them so are not associated with much reconnection. Intercluster separators connect a positive null point lying in one weak-field region to a negative null point that lies in a different weak-field region. Intercluster separators often thread enhanced regions of parallel electric field and are long. Since separators form the boundary between 4 globally-significant topologically-distinct domains, they are important sites of reconnection which can results in the global restructuring of the magnetic field. By considering the kinematic bifurcation models in which separators form it is possible to understand the formation of cluster and intercluster separators and explain their key properties.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>

      <title>Radiative hydrodynamic equations with nonequilibrium radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a kinetic model for the coupled evolution of radiation, electrons, and ions in a radiation plasma system. The model is solved using two methods. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for electron and ion hydrodynamics and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for non-equilibrium radiative transfer. The UGKS accurately captures multiscale photon transport from free streaming to diffusion across varying fluid opacities. This approach enables the scheme to model equilibrium plasma with non-equilibrium radiation transport. The model is validated through several test cases, including radiative transfer in kinetic and diffusion regimes, Marshak wave, Radiative shock, 3T(three-temperature) double lax shock tube problem, two-dimensional Sedov blast wave, and two-dimensional tophat based problem. These tests demonstrate the current scheme's capability to handle diverse radiation plasma scenarios.</description>
