      <title>Computational Complexity-Constrained Spectral Efficiency Analysis for 6G Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a tutorial on how to account for the computational time complexity overhead of signal processing in the spectral efficiency (SE) analysis of wireless waveforms. Our methodology is particularly relevant in scenarios where achieving higher SE entails a penalty in complexity, a common trade-off present in 6G candidate waveforms. We consider that SE derives from the data rate, which is impacted by time-dependent overheads. Thus, neglecting the computational complexity overhead in the SE analysis grants an unfair advantage to more computationally complex waveforms, as they require larger computational resources to meet a signal processing runtime below the symbol period. We demonstrate our points with two case studies. In the first, we refer to IEEE 802.11a-compliant baseband processors from the literature to show that their runtime significantly impacts the SE perceived by upper layers. In the second case study, we show that waveforms considered less efficient in terms of SE can outperform their more computationally expensive counterparts if provided with equivalent high-performance computational resources. Based on these cases, we believe our tutorial can address the comparative SE analysis of waveforms that operate under different computational resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Scaling Analog Photonic Accelerators for Byte-Size, Integer General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) predominantly rely on General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) kernels, which are often accelerated using specialized hardware architectures. Recently, analog photonic GEMM accelerators have emerged as a promising alternative, offering vastly superior speed and energy efficiency compared to traditional electronic accelerators. However, these photonic cannot support wider than 4-bit integer operands due to their inherent trade-offs between analog dynamic range and parallelism. This is often inadequate for DNN training as at least 8-bit wide operands are deemed necessary to prevent significant accuracy drops. To address these limitations, we introduce a scalable photonic GEMM accelerator named SPOGA. SPOGA utilizes enhanced features such as analog summation of homodyne optical signals and in-transduction positional weighting of operands. By employing an extended optical-analog dataflow that minimizes overheads associated with bit-sliced integer arithmetic, SPOGA supports byte-size integer GEMM kernels, achieving significant improvements in throughput, latency, and energy efficiency. Specifically, SPOGA demonstrates up to 14.4$\times$, 2$\times$, and 28.5$\times$ improvements in frames-per-second (FPS), FPS/Watt, and FPS/Watt/mm$^2$ respectively, compared to existing state-of-the-art photonic solutions.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Geometry Framework for Performance Analysis of RIS-assisted OFDM Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology allows one to engineer spatial diversity in complex cellular networks. This paper provides a framework for the system-level performance assessment of RIS-assisted networks and in particular downlink coverage probability and ergodic rate. To account for the inherent randomness in the spatial deployments of base stations (BSs) and RISs, we model the placements of the RISs as point processes (PPs) conditioned on the associated BSs, which are modeled by a Poisson point process (PPP). These RIS PPs can be adapted based on the deployment strategy. We focus on modeling the RISs as a Mat\'ern cluster process (MCP), where each RIS cluster is a finite PPP with support a disc centered on the association BS. We assume that the system uses the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique to exploit the multipath diversity provided by RISs. The coverage probability and the ergodic rate can be evaluated when RISs operate as batched powerless beamformers. The resulting analytical expressions provide a general methodology to evaluate the impact of key RIS-related parameters, such as the batch size and the density of RISs, on system-level performance. To demonstrate the framework's broad applicability, we also analyze a RIS placement variant where RISs are deployed around coverage holes. Numerical evaluations of the analytical expressions and Monte-Carlo simulations jointly validate the proposed analytical approach and provide valuable insights into the design of future RIS-assisted cellular networks.</description>
