      <title>Convergence Analysis of an Adaptive Nonconforming FEM for Phase-Field Dependent Topology Optimization in Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an adaptive nonconforming finite element algorithm for the numerical approximation of phase-field parameterized topology optimization governed by the Stokes system. We employ the conforming linear finite element space to approximate the phase field, and the nonconforming linear finite elements (Crouzeix-Raviart elements) and piecewise constants to approximate the velocity field and the pressure field, respectively. We establish the convergence of the adaptive method, i.e., the sequence of minimizers contains a subsequence that converges to a solution of the first-order optimality system, and the associated subsequence of discrete pressure fields also converges. The analysis relies crucially on a new discrete compactness result of nonconforming linear finite elements over a sequence of adaptively generated meshes. We present numerical results for several examples to illustrate the performance of the algorithm, including a comparison with the uniform refinement strategy.</description>

      <title>Dimension-independent convergence rates of randomized nets using median-of-means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quasi-Monte Carlo integration demonstrate that the median of linearly scrambled digital net estimators achieves near-optimal convergence rates for high-dimensional integrals without requiring a priori knowledge of the integrand's smoothness. Building on this framework, we prove that the median estimator attains dimension-independent convergence under tractability conditions characterized by low effective dimensionality, a property known as strong tractability in complexity theory. Our analysis strengthens existing guarantees by improving the convergence rates and relaxing the theoretical assumptions previously required for strong tractability.</description>

      <title>Stabilized velocity post-processings for Darcy flow in heterogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable and accurate finite element methods are presented for Darcy flow in heterogeneous porous media with an interface of discontinuity of the hydraulic conductivity tensor. Accurate velocity fields are computed through global or local post-processing formulations that use previous approximations of the hydraulic potential. Stability is provided by combining Galerkin and Least Squares (GLS) residuals of the governing equations with an additional stabilization on the interface that incorporates the discontinuity on the tangential component of the velocity field in a strong sense. Numerical analysis is outlined and numerical results are presented to illustrate the good performance of the proposed methods. Convergence studies for a heterogeneous and anisotropic porous medium confirm the same orders of convergence predicted for homogeneous problem with smooth solutions, for both global and local post-processings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the numerical analysis of the regularised total variation flow using the gradient discretisation method (GDM). GDM is a unified convergence analysis framework that covers conforming and non-conforming numerical methods, for instance, conforming and non-conforming finite element, two-point flux approximation, etc.. In this paper, a fully discretised implicit scheme of the model is proposed, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the scheme is proved, the stability and consistency of the scheme are analysed, and error estimates are established.</description>

      <title>Two families of C1-Pk Fraeijs de Veubeke-Sander finite elements on quadrilateral meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the $C^1$-$P_3$ Fraeijs de Veubeke-Sander finite element to
  two families of $C^1$-$P_k$ ($k&gt;3$) macro finite elements on
  general quadrilateral meshes. On each quadrilateral, four $P_k$ polynomials are defined on
  the four triangles subdivided from the quadrilateral by
  its two diagonal lines. The first family of $C^1$-$P_k$ finite elements is the full $C^1$-$P_k$
  space on the macro-mesh. Thus the element can be applied to interface problems. The second family of $C^1$-$P_k$ finite elements condenses
  all internal degrees of freedom by moving them to the four edges. Thus the second element method has much less unknowns but is
  more accurate than the first one. We prove the uni-solvency and the optimal order convergence. Numerical tests and comparisons with the $C^1$-$P_k$ Argyris are provided.</description>

      <title>Convergence Guarantees for Gradient-Based Training of Neural PDE Solvers: From Linear to Nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified convergence theory for gradient-based training of neural network methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), covering both physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and the Deep Ritz method. For linear PDEs, we extend the neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework for PINNs to establish global convergence guarantees for a broad class of linear operators. For nonlinear PDEs, we prove convergence to critical points via the \L{}ojasiewicz inequality under the random feature model, eliminating the need for strong over-parameterization and encompassing both gradient flow and implicit gradient descent dynamics. Our results further reveal that the random feature model exhibits an implicit regularization effect, preventing parameter divergence to infinity. Theoretical findings are corroborated by numerical experiments, providing new insights into the training dynamics and robustness of neural network PDE solvers.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the alternating least squares algorithm for CP tensor decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alternating least squares (ALS/AltLS) method is a widely used algorithm for computing the CP decomposition of a tensor. However, its convergence theory is still incompletely understood.
  In this paper, we prove explicit quantitative local convergence theorems for CP-AltLS applied to orthogonally decomposable and incoherently decomposable tensors. Specifically, we show that CP-AltLS converges polynomially with order $N-1$ for $N$th-order orthogonally decomposable tensors and linearly for incoherently decomposable tensors, with convergence being measured in terms of the angles between the factors of the exact tensor and those of the approximate tensor. Unlike existing results, our analysis is both quantitative and constructive, applying to standard CP-AltLS and accommodating factor matrices with small but nonzero mutual coherence, while remaining applicable to tensors of arbitrary rank.
  We also confirm these rates of convergence numerically and investigate accelerating the convergence of CP-AltLS using an SVD-based coherence reduction scheme.</description>

      <title>Variably Scaled Kernels for the regularized solution of the parametric Fourier imaging problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of approximating parametric Fourier imaging problems via interpolation/ extrapolation algorithms that impose smoothing constraints across contiguous values of the parameter. Previous works already proved that interpolating via Variably Scaled Kernels (VSKs) the scattered observations in the Fourier domain and then defining the sought approximation via the projected Landweber iterative scheme, turns out to be effective. This study provides new theoretical insights, including error bounds in the image space and properties of the projected Landweber iterative scheme, both influenced by the choice of the scaling function, which characterizes the VSK basis. Such bounds then suggest a smarter solution for the definition of the scaling functions. Indeed, by means of VSKs, the information coded in an image reconstructed for a given parameter is transferred during the reconstruction process to a contiguous parameter value. Benchmark test cases in the field of astronomical imaging, numerically show that the proposed scheme is able to regularize along the parameter direction, thus proving reliable and interpretable results.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic trigonometric functions as approximation kernels and their properties I: generalised Fourier transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a new class of radial basis functions based on hyperbolic trigonometric functions will be introduced and studied. We focus on the properties of their generalised Fourier transforms with asymptotics. Therefore we will compute the expansions of these Fourier transforms with an application of the conditions of Strang and Fix in order to prove polynomial exactness of quasi-interpolants. These quasi-interpolants will be formed with special linear combinations of shifts of the new radial functions and we will provide explicit expressions for their coefficients. In establishing these new radial basis functions we will also use other, new classes of shifted thin-plate splines and multiquadrics of  [11], [12]. There are numerical examples and comparisons of different constructions of quasi-interpolants, in several dimensions, varying the underlying radial basis functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on RBF-based meshless methods for approximating differential operators, one of the most popular being RBF-FD. Recently, a hybrid approach was introduced that combines RBF interpolation and traditional finite difference stencils. We compare the accuracy of this method and RBF-FD on a two-dimensional Poisson problem for standard five-point and nine-point stencils and different method parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a general technique for establishing the strong convergence of numerical methods for stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) in the infinite horizon. This technique can also be extended to analyze certain continuous function-valued segment processes associated with the numerical methods, facilitating the numerical approximation of invariant measures of SDDEs. To illustrate the application of these results, we specifically investigate the backward and truncated Euler-Maruyama methods. Several numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Inverse nonlinear fast Fourier transform on SU(2) with applications to quantum signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Fourier transform (NLFT) extends the classical Fourier transform by replacing addition with matrix multiplication. While the NLFT on $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ has been widely studied, its $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ variant has only recently attracted attention due to emerging applications in quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). In this paper, we investigate the inverse NLFT on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and establish the numerical stability of the layer stripping algorithm for the first time under suitable conditions. Furthermore, we develop a fast and numerically stable algorithm, called inverse nonlinear fast Fourier transform, for performing inverse NLFT with near-linear complexity. This algorithm is applicable to computing phase factors for both QSP and the generalized QSP (GQSP).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a pointwise tracking multiobjective optimal control problem subject to the Poisson problem and bilateral control constraints. To approximate Pareto optimal points and the Pareto front numerically, we consider two different finite element-based scalarization techniques, namely the weighted-sum method and the reference point method, where in both methods many scalar-constrained optimization problems have to be solved. We prove a priori error estimates for both scalarizations. The underlying subproblems of either method are solved with a Barzilai-Borwein gradient method. Numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Partition-wise Graph Filtering: A Unified Perspective Through the Lens of Graph Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering, which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Learning High-dimensional Ionic Model Dynamics Using Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionic models, described by systems of stiff ordinary differential equations, are fundamental tools for simulating the complex dynamics of excitable cells in both Computational Neuroscience and Cardiology. Approximating these models using Artificial Neural Networks poses significant challenges due to their inherent stiffness, multiscale nonlinearities, and the wide range of dynamical behaviors they exhibit, including multiple equilibrium points, limit cycles, and intricate interactions. While in previous studies the dynamics of the transmembrane potential has been predicted in low dimensionality settings, in the present study we extend these results by investigating whether Fourier Neural Operators can effectively learn the evolution of all the state variables within these dynamical systems in higher dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by accurately learning the dynamics of three well-established ionic models with increasing dimensionality: the two-variable FitzHugh-Nagumo model, the four-variable Hodgkin-Huxley model, and the forty-one-variable O'Hara-Rudy model. To ensure the selection of near-optimal configurations for the Fourier Neural Operator, we conducted automatic hyperparameter tuning under two scenarios: an unconstrained setting, where the number of trainable parameters is not limited, and a constrained case with a fixed number of trainable parameters. Both constrained and unconstrained architectures achieve comparable results in terms of accuracy across all the models considered. However, the unconstrained architecture required approximately half the number of training epochs to achieve similar error levels, as evidenced by the loss function values recorded during training. These results underline the capabilities of Fourier Neural Operators to accurately capture complex multiscale dynamics, even in high-dimensional dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating multigrid with streaming chiral SVD for Wilson fermions in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A modification to the setup algorithm for the multigrid preconditioner of Wilson fermions in lattice QCD is presented. A larger basis of test vectors than that used in conventional multigrid is calculated by the smoother and truncated by singular value decomposition on the chiral components of the test vectors. The truncated basis is used to form the prolongation and restriction matrices of the multigrid hierarchy. This modification of the setup method is demonstrated to increase the convergence of linear solvers on an anisotropic lattice with $m_{\pi} \approx 239$ MeV from the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration and an isotropic lattice with $m_{\pi} \approx 220$ MeV from the MILC Collaboration. The lattice volume dependence of the method is also examined. Increasing the number of test vectors improves speedup up to a point, but storing these vectors becomes impossible in limited memory resources such as GPUs. To address storage cost, we implement a \emph{streaming} singular value decomposition of the basis of test vectors on the chiral components and demonstrate a decrease in the number of fine level iterations by a factor of 1.7 for $m_q \approx m_{crit}$.</description>

      <title>FEM for 1D-problems involving the logarithmic Laplacian: error estimates and numerical implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the numerical analysis of a finite element method (FEM) for one-dimensional Dirichlet problems involving the logarithmic Laplacian (the pseudo-differential operator that appears as a first-order expansion of the fractional Laplacian as the exponent $s\to 0^+$). Our analysis exhibits new phenomena in this setting; in particular, using recently obtained regularity results, we prove rigorous error estimates and provide a logarithmic order of convergence in the energy norm using suitable $\log$-weighted spaces. Moreover, we show that the stiffness matrix of logarithmic problems can be obtained as the derivative of the fractional stiffness matrix evaluated at $s=0$. Lastly, we investigate the relationship between the discrete eigenvalue problem and its convergence to the continuous one.</description>

      <title>Graph-based methods for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws using discontinuous space discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a graph-based numerical method for solving hyperbolic systems of conservation laws using discontinuous finite elements. This work fills important gaps in the theory as well as practice of graph-based schemes. In particular, four building blocks required for the implementation of flux-limited graph-based methods are developed and tested: a first-order method with mathematical guarantees of robustness; a high-order method based on the entropy viscosity technique; a procedure to compute local bounds; and a convex limiting scheme. Two important features of the current work are the fact that (i) boundary conditions are incorporated into the mathematical theory as well as the implementation of the scheme. For instance, the first-order version of the scheme satisfies pointwise entropy inequalities including boundary effects for any boundary data that is admissible; (ii) sub-cell limiting is built into the convex limiting framework. This is in contrast to the majority of the existing methodologies that consider a single limiter per cell providing no sub-cell limiting capabilities.
  From a practical point of view, the implementation of graph-based methods is algebraic, meaning that they operate directly on the stencil of the spatial discretization. In principle, these methods do not need to use or invoke loops on cells or faces of the mesh. Finally, we verify convergence rates on various well-known test problems with differing regularity. We propose a simple test in order to verify the implementation of boundary conditions and their convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Column reduced digital nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital nets provide an efficient way to generate integration nodes of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) rules. For certain applications, as e.g. in Uncertainty Quantification, we are interested in obtaining a speed-up in computing products of a matrix with the vectors corresponding to the nodes of a QMC rule. In the recent paper "The fast reduced QMC matrix-vector product" (J. Comput. Appl. Math. 440, 115642, 2024), a speed up was obtained by using so-called reduced lattices and row reduced digital nets. In this work, we propose a different multiplication algorithm where we exploit the repetitive structure of column reduced digital nets instead of row reduced digital nets. This method has advantages over the previous one, as it facilitates the error analysis when using the integration nodes in a QMC rule. We also provide an upper bound for the quality parameter of column reduced digital nets, and numerical tests to illustrate the efficiency of the new algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Recipe for Learning Variably Scaled Kernels via Discontinuous Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficacy of interpolating via Variably Scaled Kernels (VSKs) is known to be dependent on the definition of a proper scaling function, but no numerical recipes to construct it are available. Previous works suggest that such a function should mimic the target one, but no theoretical evidence is provided. This paper fills both the gaps: it proves that a scaling function reflecting the target one may lead to enhanced approximation accuracy, and it provides a user-independent tool for learning the scaling function by means of Discontinuous Neural Networks ($\delta$NN), i.e., NNs able to deal with possible discontinuities. Numerical evidence supports our claims, as it shows that the key features of the target function can be clearly recovered in the learned scaling function.</description>

      <title>Parameter optimization for restarted mixed precision iterative sparse solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the parameter of a two-stage algorithm for approximate solution of a system of linear algebraic equations with a sparse $n\times n$-matrix, i.e., with one in which the number of nonzero elements is $m\!=\!O(n)$. The two-stage algorithm uses conjugate gradient method at its stages. At the 1st stage, an approximate solution with accuracy $\varepsilon_1$ is found for zero initial vector. All numerical values used at this stage are represented as single precision numbers. The obtained solution is used as initial approximation for an approximate solution with a given accuracy $\varepsilon_2$ that we obtain at the 2nd stage, where double precision numbers are used. Based on the values of some matrix parameters, computed in a time not exceeding $O(m)$, we need to determine the value $\varepsilon_1$ which minimizes the total computation time at two stages. Using single precision numbers for computations at the 1st stage is advantageous, since the execution time of one iteration will be approximately half that of one iteration at the 2nd stage. But using machine numbers with half the mantissa length accelerates the growth of the rounding errors per iteration at the 1st stage, which entails an increase in the number of iterations performed at 2nd stage. To determine $\varepsilon_1$ for the input matrix, we use $n$, $m$, an estimation of the diameter of the graph associated with the matrix, an estimation of the spread of the matrix' eigenvalues, and estimation of its maximum eigenvalue. The optimal or close to the optimal value of $\varepsilon_1$ can be determined for matrix with such a vector of parameters using the nearest neighbor regression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of robust and optimal mixed methods based on two mixed formulations of the fourth-order elliptic singular perturbation problem are developed in this paper. First, a mixed method based on a second-order system is proposed without relying on Nitsche's technique. Robust and optimal error estimates are derived using an $L^2$-bounded interpolation operator for tensors. Then, its connections to other discrete methods, including weak Galerkin methods and a mixed finite element method based on a first-order system, are established. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Natural Gradient Descent for PINNs with Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) has emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for training neural network-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs), such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of solving linear systems involving the Gramian matrix. While matrix-free NGD methods based on the conjugate gradient (CG) method avoid explicit matrix inversion, the ill-conditioning of the Gramian significantly slows the convergence of CG. In this work, we extend matrix-free NGD to broader classes of problems than previously considered and propose the use of Randomized Nystr\"om preconditioning to accelerate convergence of the inner CG solver. The resulting algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing NGD-based methods on a range of PDE problems discretized using neural networks.</description>

      <title>Unified Stochastic Framework for Neural Network Quantization and Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization and pruning are two essential techniques for compressing neural networks, yet they are often treated independently, with limited theoretical analysis connecting them. This paper introduces a unified framework for post-training quantization and pruning using stochastic path-following algorithms. Our approach builds on the Stochastic Path Following Quantization (SPFQ) method, extending its applicability to pruning and low-bit quantization, including challenging 1-bit regimes. By incorporating a scaling parameter and generalizing the stochastic operator, the proposed method achieves robust error correction and yields rigorous theoretical error bounds for both quantization and pruning as well as their combination.</description>

      <title>ERGNN: Spectral Graph Neural Network With Explicitly-Optimized Rational Graph Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximation-based spectral graph neural networks, which construct graph filters with function approximation, have shown substantial performance in graph learning tasks. Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</description>

      <title>Dual-Balancing for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a new learning paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by enforcing the constraints of physical equations, boundary conditions (BCs), and initial conditions (ICs) into the loss function. Despite their successes, vanilla PINNs still suffer from poor accuracy and slow convergence due to the intractable multi-objective optimization issue. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Balanced PINN (DB-PINN), which dynamically adjusts loss weights by integrating inter-balancing and intra-balancing to alleviate two imbalance issues in PINNs. Inter-balancing aims to mitigate the gradient imbalance between PDE residual loss and condition-fitting losses by determining an aggregated weight that offsets their gradient distribution discrepancies. Intra-balancing acts on condition-fitting losses to tackle the imbalance in fitting difficulty across diverse conditions. By evaluating the fitting difficulty based on the loss records, intra-balancing can allocate the aggregated weight proportionally to each condition loss according to its fitting difficulty level. We further introduce a robust weight update strategy to prevent abrupt spikes and arithmetic overflow in instantaneous weight values caused by large loss variances, enabling smooth weight updating and stable training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DB-PINN achieves significantly superior performance than those popular gradient-based weighting methods in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. Our code and supplementary material are available at https://github.com/chenhong-zhou/DualBalanced-PINNs.</description>

      <title>CASL-HJX: A Comprehensive Guide to Solving Deterministic and Stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CASL-HJX is a computational framework designed for solving deterministic and stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equations in two spatial dimensions. It provides a flexible and efficient approach to modeling front propagation problems, optimal control problems, and stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman equations. The framework integrates numerical methods for hyperbolic PDEs with operator splitting techniques and implements implicit methods for second-order derivative terms, ensuring convergence to viscosity solutions while achieving global rather than local optimization. Built with a high-performance C++ core, CASL-HJX efficiently handles mixed-order derivative systems with time-varying dynamics, making it suitable for real-world applications across multiple domains. We demonstrate the solver's versatility through tutorial examples covering various PDEs and through applications in neuroscience, where it enables the design of energy-efficient controllers for regulating neural populations to mitigate pathological synchrony. While our examples focus on these applications, the mathematical foundation of the solver makes it applicable to problems in finance, engineering, and machine learning. The modular architecture allows researchers to define computational domains, configure problems, and execute simulations with high numerical accuracy. CASL-HJX bridges the gap between deterministic control methods and stochastic models, providing a robust tool for managing uncertainty in complex dynamical systems.</description>
