      <title>Dirac Theory as a Relativistic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous papers we have shown how Schr\"{o}dinger's equation which includes an electromagnetic field interaction can be deduced from a fluid dynamical Lagrangian of a charged potential flow that interacts with an electromagnetic field. The quantum behaviour was derived from Fisher information terms which were added to the classical Lagrangian. It was thus shown that a quantum mechanical system is drived by information and not only electromagnetic fields.
  This program was applied also to Pauli's equations by removing the restriction of potential flow and using the Clebsch formalism. Although the analysis was quite successful there were still terms that did not admit interpretation, some of them can be easily traced to the relativistic Dirac theory. Here we repeat the analysis for a relativistic flow, pointing to a new approach for deriving relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Distributed and Secure Kernel-Based Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to revolutionize machine learning, offering significant efficiency gains in tasks such as clustering and distance estimation. Additionally, it provides enhanced security through fundamental principles like the measurement postulate and the no-cloning theorem, enabling secure protocols such as quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution. While advancements in secure quantum machine learning are notable, the development of secure and distributed quantum analogues of kernel-based machine learning techniques remains underexplored.
  In this work, we present a novel approach for securely computing common kernels, including polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and Laplacian kernels, when data is distributed, using quantum feature maps. Our methodology introduces a robust framework that leverages quantum teleportation to ensure secure and distributed kernel learning. The proposed architecture is validated using IBM's Qiskit Aer Simulator on various public datasets.</description>

      <title>Exploring the relation between qubit count in entangled systems and the CKW inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we examine the entanglement within two entangled n-qubit systems using the $\pi$-tangle, the sum of the negativities of subsystems, and the sum of the squares of one-tangles. Our findings reveal that in certain states, such as the generalized W state, where probability coefficients depend on the number of qubits, an increase in the number of particles causes the $\pi$-tangle to approach zero, while the CKW inequality converges to equality. In such cases, assessing the system's entanglement can be effectively achieved by summing the negativities of bipartitions or summing the squares of one-tangles. Conversely, in entangled states with probability coefficients independent of the number of qubits, such as the GHZ state, the $\pi$-tangle serves as an appropriate measure for studying the system's entanglement.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking quantum machine learning kernel training for classification tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that aims to leverage the unique properties of quantum mechanics to enhance classical machine learning. However, the practical applicability of these methods remains an open question, particularly in the context of real-world datasets and the limitations of current quantum hardware. This work performs a benchmark study of Quantum Kernel Estimation (QKE) and Quantum Kernel Training (QKT) with a focus on classification tasks. Through a series of experiments, the versatility and generalization capabilities of two quantum feature mappings, namely ZZFeatureMap and CovariantFeatureMap, are analyzed in this context. Remarkably, these feature maps have been proposed in the literature under the conjecture of possible near-term quantum advantage and have shown promising performance in ad-hoc datasets. This study explores both artificial and established reference datasets and incorporates classical machine learning methods, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and logistic regression, as baseline comparisons. Experimental results indicate that quantum methods exhibit varying performance across different datasets. While they outperform classical methods in ad-hoc datasets, they frequently encounter difficulties in generalizing to unseen test data when dealing with reference classical datasets, even if achieving high classification accuracy on the training data. It is suggested that the choice of the feature mapping and the optimization of kernel parameters through QKT are critical for maximizing the effectiveness of quantum methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum scars in many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaos makes isolated systems of many interacting particles quickly thermalize and forget about their past. Here, we show that quantum mechanics hinders chaos in many-body systems: although the quantum eigenstates are thermal and strongly entangled, exponentially many of them are scarred, that is, have an enlarged weight along underlying classical unstable periodic orbits. Scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past and thus weakly breaking ergodicity, even at long times and despite the system being fully thermal. We demonstrate the ubiquity of quantum scarring in many-body systems by considering a large family of spin models, including some of the most popular ones from condensed matter physics. Our findings, at hand for modern quantum simulators, prove structure in spite of chaos in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Strict area law entanglement versus chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Channel nonlocality under decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of realistic quantum devices requires a solid understanding of the nonlocal resources present in quantum channels, and the effects of decoherence on them. Here we quantify nonlocality of bipartite quantum channels and identify its component resisting the effects of dephasing noise. Despite its classical nature, we demonstrate that the latter plays a relevant role in performing quantum protocols, such as state transformations and quantum coding for noisy communication. In the converse direction, we show that simulating certain stochastic processes with quantum channels undergoing decoherence has a communication advantage with respect to their classical simulation.</description>

      <title>SDP bounds on quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a semidefinite programming hierarchy based on state polynomial optimization to determine the existence of quantum codes with given parameters. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that if a $(\!(n,K,\delta)\!)_2$ code does not exist then a level of the hierarchy is infeasible. It is not limited to stabilizer codes and thus applicable generally. While it is formally dimension-free, we restrict it to qubit codes through quasi-Clifford algebras. We derive the quantum analog of a range of classical results: first, from an intermediate level a Lov\'asz bound for self-dual quantum codes is recovered. Second, a symmetrization of a minor variation of this Lov\'asz bound recovers the quantum Delsarte bound. Third, a symmetry reduction using the Terwilliger algebra leads to semidefinite programming bounds of size $O(n^4)$. With this we give an alternative proof that there is no $(\!(7,1,4)\!)_2$ quantum code, and show that $(\!(8,9,3)\!)_2$ and $(\!(10,5,4)\!)_2$ codes do not exist.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Hardware Efficient Photonic Variational Quantum Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has brought a paradigm change in computer science, where non-classical technologies have promised to outperform their classical counterpart. Such an advantage was only demonstrated for tasks without practical applications, still out of reach for the state-of-art quantum technologies. In this context, a promising strategy to find practical use of quantum computers is to exploit hybrid quantum-classical models, where a quantum device estimates a hard-to-compute quantity, while a classical optimizer trains the parameters of the model. In this work, we demonstrate that single photons and linear optical networks are sufficient for implementing Variational Quantum Algorithms, when the problem specification, or ansatz, is tailored to this specific platform. We show this by a proof-of-principle demonstration of a variational approach to tackle an instance of a factorization task, whose solution is encoded in the ground state of a suitable Hamiltonian. This work which combines Variational Quantum Algorithms with hardware efficient ansatzes for linear-optics networks showcases a promising pathway towards practical applications for photonic quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Towards Necessary and sufficient state condition for violation of a multi-settings Bell inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dimensional quantum entanglement and the advancements in their experimental realization provide a playground for fundamental research and eventually lead to quantum technological developments. The Horodecki criterion determines whether a state violates Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality for a two-qubit entangled state, solely from the state parameters. However, it remains a challenging task to formulate similar necessary and sufficient criteria for a high-dimensional entangled state for the violation of a suitable Bell inequality. Here, we develop a Horodecki-like criterion based on the state parameters of arbitrary two-qudit states to violate a two-outcome Bell inequality involving $2^{n-1}$ and $n$ measurement settings for Alice and Bob, respectively. This inequality reduces to the well-known CHSH and Gisin's elegant Bell inequalities for $n=2$ and $n=3$, respectively. While the proposed criterion is sufficient to violate the Bell inequality, it becomes necessary as well for the following cases; (i) $m$ copies of Bell diagonal states for arbitrary $n$, (ii) Non-decomposable states whose correlation matrix is diagonalized by local unitaries, and (iii) for any arbitrary two-qubit state when $n=3$, where the maximal value of the Bell functional is achieved with Bob's measurements being pairwise anticommuting. For any states, we derive the constraints on Alice's measurements in achieving the maximum quantum violation for this inequality.</description>

      <title>Self-testing of multiple unsharpness parameters through sequential violations of non-contextual inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-testing protocols refer to novel device-independent certification schemes wherein the devices are uncharacterised, and the dimension of the system remains unspecified. The optimal quantum violation of a Bell's inequality facilitates such self-testing. In this work, we put forth a protocol for self-testing of noisy quantum instruments, specifically, the unsharpness parameter of smeared projective measurements in any arbitrary dimension. Our protocol hinges on the sequential quantum violations of a bipartite Bell-type preparation non-contextual inequality, involving three measurement settings per party. First, we demonstrate that at most three sequential independent Bobs manifest simultaneous preparation contextuality with a single Alice through the violation of this inequality. Subsequently, we show that the sub-optimal sequential quantum violations of the non-contextual inequality form an optimal set, eventually enabling the self-testing of shared state, local measurements and unsharpness parameters of one party. Notably, we derive the optimal set of quantum violations without specifying the dimension of the quantum system, thereby circumventing the constraint that may arise due to Naimark's theorem. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to quantify the degree of incompatible measurements pertaining to the sequential observers, exploring how variations in the degree of incompatibility impact the values of unsharp parameters necessary for sequential quantum violation.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical properties of Group-IV--vacancy centers in diamond upon hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V($-$) or G4V centers, have received a great attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of the G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180~GPa. The spin-orbit splitting for the electronic ground and excited states and the hyperfine tensors are calculated by means of plane wave supercell density functional theory as unique fingerprints of these defects. To this end, we developed a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with adding hydrostatic pressures where the coupling strength increases from SiV($-$) to PbV($-$). On the other hand, the calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that the operation of PbV($-$) based quantum sensor is limited up to 30~GPa of hydrostatic pressure whereas SnV($-$), GeV($-$) and SiV($-$) remain photostable up to 180~GPa of hydrostatic pressure.</description>

      <title>Advances in quantum algorithms for the shortest path problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an undirected, weighted graph, and two special vertices $s$ and $t$, the problem is to find the shortest path between them. We give two bounded-error quantum algorithms in the adjacency list model that solve the problem on structured instances. The first approach is based on sparsifying the original graph via sampling the quantum flow state and running a classical algorithm on the smaller problem. It has time complexity of $\tilde{O}(l^2\sqrt{m})$ and uses $O(\log{l})$ space, where $l$ is the length (or total weight, in case of weighted graphs) of the shortest $s$-$t$ path. The main result is the second approach which is based on a divide and conquer procedure that outputs the shortest path in $\tilde{O}(l\sqrt{m})$ steps when using $O(\log{l})$ space, and can be parallelised to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{lm})$ circuit depth when using $O(l\log{l})$ space. With the latter we partially resolve with an affirmative answer the open problem of whether a path between two vertices can be found in the time required to detect it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the $6\times 6$ complex Hadamard matrices (CHMs) is an open problem in linear algebra and quantum information. In this paper, we investigate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of CHMs. We show that any $n\times n$ CHM with dephased form has two constant eigenvalues $\pm\sqrt{n}$ and has two constant eigenvectors. We obtain the maximum numbers of identical eigenvalues of $6\times 6$ CHMs with dephased form and we extend this result to arbitrary dimension. We also show that there is no $6\times 6$ CHM with four identical eigenvalues. We conjecture that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $6\times 6$ CHMs will lead to the complete classification of $6\times 6$ CHMs.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Symmetry-Protected Signature of 3-body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and characterizing multi-body interactions in quantum processes remains a significant challenge. This is partly because 2-body interactions can produce an arbitrary time evolution, a fundamental fact often called the universality of 2-local gates in the context of quantum computing. However, when an unknown Hamiltonian respects a U(1) symmetry such as charge or particle number conservation, N-body interactions exhibit a distinct symmetry-protected signature known as the N-body phase, which fewer-body interactions cannot mimic. We develop and demonstrate an efficient technique for the detection of 3-body interactions despite the presence of unknown 2-body interactions. This technique, which takes advantage of GHZ states for phase estimation, requires probing the unitary evolution and measuring its determinant in a small subspace that scales linearly with the system size, making it an efficient approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) offers the potential to enhance traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads by leveraging the unique properties of quantum computers, leading to the emergence of a new paradigm: HPC-QC. While this integration presents new opportunities, it also brings novel challenges, particularly in ensuring the dependability of such hybrid systems. This paper aims to identify integration challenges, anticipate failures, and foster a diverse co-design for HPC-QC systems by bringing together QC, cloud computing, HPC, and network security. The focus of this emerging inter-disciplinary effort is to develop engineering principles that ensure the dependability of hybrid systems, aiming for a more prescriptive co-design cycle. Our framework will help to prevent design pitfalls and accelerate the maturation of the QC technology ecosystem. Key aspects include building resilient HPC-QC systems, analyzing the applicability of conventional techniques to the quantum domain, and exploring the complexity of scaling in such hybrid systems. This underscores the need for performance-reliability metrics specific to this new computational paradigm.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-enabled quantum holograms with hybrid entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, with their capability to control all possible dimensions of light, have become integral to quantum optical applications, including quantum state generation, operation, and tomography. In this work, we utilize a metasurface to generate polarization-hologram hybrid entanglement between a signal-idler photon pair to construct a quantum hologram. The properties of the quantum hologram can be revealed by collapsing the polarization degree of freedom of the idler photon, inducing interference between two holographic states of the signal photon, as a meaningful and selective erasure of the holographic content. In contrary, interference disappears when the idler photon is detected without observing polarization. This process can be further interpreted as a quantum holographic eraser, where the erasing action is visualized with erased contents in holograms. Our construction of polarization-hologram hybrid entangled state with metasurfaces will be useful for quantum communication with enhanced robustness, anti-counterfeiting applications through the additional quantum degrees of freedom, and as an emerging platform for exploring fundamental quantum concepts for entanglement and non-locality.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Quantum Resources in Nonlocality Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocality, evidenced by the violation of Bell inequalities, not only signifies entanglement but also highlights measurement incompatibility in quantum systems. Utilizing the generalized Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality, our high-efficiency optical setup achieves a loophole-free violation of $2.0132$. This result provides a device-independent lower bound on entanglement, quantified as the entanglement of formation at $0.0159$. Moreover, by tuning the parameters of the generalized Bell inequality, we enhance the estimation of measurement incompatibility, which is quantified by an effective overlap of $4.3883 \times 10^{-5}$. To explore the intricate interplay among nonlocality, entanglement, and measurement incompatibility, we generate mixed states, allowing for flexible modulation of entanglement via fast switching among the four Bell states using Pockels cells, achieving a fidelity above $99.10\%$. Intriguingly, our results reveal a counterintuitive relationship where increasing incompatibility initially boosts nonlocality but eventually leads to its reduction. Typically, maximal nonlocality does not coincide with maximal incompatibility. This experimental study sheds light on the optimal management of quantum resources for Bell-inequality-based quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Trajectory-Inspired Lindbladian Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems is a crucial task in quantum computing, offering wide-ranging applications but remaining computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose two quantum algorithms for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. We introduce a new approximation channel for short-time evolution, inspired by the quantum trajectory method, which underpins the efficiency of our algorithms. The first algorithm achieves a gate complexity independent of the number of jump operators, $m$, marking a significant improvement in efficiency. The second algorithm achieves near-optimal dependence on the evolution time $t$ and precision $\epsilon$ and introduces only an additional $\tilde{O}(m)$ factor, which strictly improves upon state-of-the-art gate-based quantum algorithm that has an $\tilde O(m^2)$ factor. In both our algorithms, the reduction of dependence on $m$ significantly enhances the efficiency of simulating practical dissipative processes characterized by a large number of jump operators.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-covariance of Position Operator and its Eigenstates for a massive spin $1/2$ field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a derivation of a position operator for a massive field with spin $1/2$, expressed in a representation-independent form of the Poincar\'e group. Using the recently derived Lorentz-covariant field spin operator, we obtain a corresponding field position operator through the total angular momentum formula. Acting on the Dirac spinor representation, the eigenvalues of the field position operator correspond to the spatial components of the Lorentz-covariant space-time coordinate $4$-vector. We show that the field position operator preserves the particle and the antiparticle character of the states. Thus, the field position operator can serve as a one-particle position operator for both particles and antiparticles, thereby avoiding an unusual fast-oscillating term, known as the Zitterbewegung, associated with the Dirac position operator. We show that the field position operator yields the same velocity as a classical free particle. The eigenstates of the field position operator satisfy the Newton-Wigner locality criteria and transform in a Lorentz-covariant manner. The field position operator becomes particle position and antiparticle position operators when acting on the particle and the antiparticle subspaces, both of which are Hermitian. Additionally, we demonstrate that within the particle subspace of the Dirac spinor space, the field position operator is equivalent to the Newton-Wigner position operator.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Continuous-Time Quantum Walk on Sparse Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) play a crucial role in quantum computing, especially for designing quantum algorithms. However, how to efficiently implement CTQWs is a challenging issue. In this paper, we study implementation of CTQWs on sparse graphs, i.e., constructing efficient quantum circuits for implementing the unitary operator $e^{-iHt}$, where $H=\gamma A$ ($\gamma$ is a constant and $A$ corresponds to the adjacency matrix of a graph). Our result is, for a $d$-sparse graph with $N$ vertices and evolution time $t$, we can approximate $e^{-iHt}$ by a quantum circuit with gate complexity $(d^3 \|H\| t N \log N)^{1+o(1)}$, compared to the general Pauli decomposition, which scales like $(\|H\| t N^4 \log N)^{1+o(1)}$. For sparse graphs, for instance, $d=O(1)$, we obtain a noticeable improvement. Interestingly, our technique is related to graph decomposition. More specifically, we decompose the graph into a union of star graphs, and correspondingly, the Hamiltonian $H$ can be represented as the sum of some Hamiltonians $H_j$, where each $e^{-iH_jt}$ is a CTQW on a star graph which can be implemented efficiently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider multi-dimensional birth and death chains and continuous time quantum walks (CTQW) related to them. For CTQW related to our forms of multi-dimensional birth and death chains, we obtain the time scaled independence between multiple dimensions about the transition probability of CTQW. By using this feature, we analyze CTQW on the path graph, which is related to 1-dimensional Ehrenfest model. We also have a random variable which is related to our models and converges to the standard Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation with Space Contributions Embedded in a Quantum-Corrected Gravitational Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the interface between curved spacetime quantum mechanics and applications in space quantum communications, quantum technologies and quantum optics, the Dirac equation is considered with the recently proposed generalized gravitational interaction (Kepler or Coulomb), which includes post-Newtonian (relativistic) and quantum corrections to the classical potential. The general idea in choosing the metric is that the spacetime contributions are contained in an external potential or in an electromagnetic potential which can be considered as a good basis for future studies on space quantum communication. We also discuss several known generalizations of the Coulomb potential within this formulation in terms of certain Heun functions. The impossibility of solving our equation for the quantum-corrected Coulomb terms using known exact or quasi-exact nonperturbative analytical techniques is discussed, and finally the Bethe-ansatz approach is proposed to overcome this challenging problem.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Quantum Information Scrambling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling (QI-scrambling) is a pivotal area of inquiry within the study of quantum many-body systems. This research derives mathematical upper and lower bounds for the scrambling rate by applying the Maligranda inequality. Our results indicate that the upper bounds, lower bounds, and scrambling rates coincide precisely when local operators exhibit Hermitian and unitary operators. Crucially, the convergence or divergence of these upper and lower bounds relative to the scrambling rate is contingent upon the system's initial state. To validate our theoretical framework, we investigated the spin-star model, considering both thermal and pure initial states. Furthermore, three distinct scenarios for local operators were examined, namely single-qubit, one multi-qubit, and both multi-qubit configurations. The implantation of the ancilla or external qubit aligns the scrambling rate with the established bounds. The upper and lower bounds may diverge from the scrambling rate based on the system's initial state when both local operators are multi-qubit systems. We noticed that the scrambling rate increased as the number of qubits in local operators increased.</description>

      <title>Robust self-testing of the $m-$partite maximally entangled state and observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum technologies continue to advance rapidly, the device-independent testing of the functioning of a quantum device has become increasingly important. Self-testing, a correlation based protocol, enables such certification of a promised quantum state as well as measurements performed on it without requiring knowledge of the device's internal workings. This approach typically relies on achieving the optimal quantum violation of a suitable Bell inequality. Self-testing has been extensively investigated in the context of bipartite Bell experiments. However, its extension to multipartite scenarios remains largely unexplored, owing to the intricate nature of multipartite quantum correlations. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient self-testing protocol that certifies the state and observables based on the optimal quantum violation of the Svetlichny inequality involving an arbitrary number of parties, each with two inputs. Our method leverages an elegant sum-of-squares approach to derive the optimal quantum value of the Svetlichny functional, devoid of assuming the dimension of the quantum system. This enables the self-testing of the $m-$partite maximally entangled state and local anti-commuting observables for each party. Moreover, we develop a swap circuit isometry to assess the proximity of reference states and measurements to their ideal counterparts in the presence of noise and imperfections in real experiments, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our self-testing protocol. Finally, we illustrate how our self-testing protocol facilitates the generation of certified genuine randomness from correlations that enable the optimal violation of the Svetlichny inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distance of a stabilizer quantum code is a very important feature since it determines the number of errors that can be detected and corrected. We present three new fast algorithms and implementations for computing the symplectic distance of the associated classical code. Our new algorithms are based on the Brouwer-Zimmermann algorithm. Our experimental study shows that these new implementations are much faster than current state-of-the-art licensed implementations on single-core processors, multicore processors, and shared-memory multiprocessors. In the most computationally-demanding cases, the performance gain in the computational time can be larger than one order of magnitude. The experimental study also shows a good scalability on shared-memory parallel architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an interesting mathematical feedback between the formalism of coherent states and the field of integrals and integral representations involving special functions. This materializes through an easy and fast method to calculate integrals or integral representations of different functions, expressible by means of Meijer's G-, as well as hypergeometric generalized functions. The feedback starts from a fundamental integral that comes from the decomposition of the unity operator in the language of coherent states from quantum mechanics. In this way, integrals and integral representations are obtained, some that do not appear in the literature, and others already known, which can be verified by orthodox methods. All calculations are made using the properties of the diagonal operators ordering technique (DOOT), a relatively new technique of normal ordering of the creation and annihilation operators in quantum mechanics. The paper contributes to increasing the number of solvable integrals involving special functions.</description>

      <title>Non-linear classification capability of quantum neural networks due to emergent quantum metastability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power and expressivity of deep classical neural networks can be attributed to non-linear input-output relations. Such non-linearities are at the heart of many computational tasks, such as data classification and pattern recognition. Quantum neural networks, on the other hand, are necessarily linear as they process information via unitary operations. Here we show that effective non-linearities can be implemented in these platforms by exploiting the relationship between information processing and many-body quantum dynamics. The crucial point is that quantum many-body systems can show emergent collective behavior in the vicinity of phase transitions, which leads to an effectively non-linear dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. In the context of quantum neural networks, which are necessarily finite, this translates into metastability with transient non-ergodic behavior. By using a quantum neural network whose architecture is inspired by dissipative many-body quantum spin models, we show that this mechanism indeed allows to realize non-linear data classification, despite the underlying dynamics being local and linear. Our proof-of-principle study may pave the way for the systematic construction of quantum neural networks with emergent non-linear properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a quantum theory for pulsed photon pair generation in a single ring resonator. Our approach combines the Heisenberg picture input-output formalism with the Ikeda mapping from classical nonlinear optics. In doing so, we address the high-gain regime by incorporating non-perturbative effects, including self-phase modulation, cross-phase modulation, and time-ordering, which are roots for significantly different behaviors in the low-gain regime. We also account for optical losses by introducing an auxiliary waveguide, allowing for a more accurate representation of experimentally viable scenarios. Numerical simulations reveal that non-perturbative effects significantly distort transfer functions, making desirable operations challenging without careful optimization. We show that appropriate detuning of the pump frequency can mitigate these issues, leading to enhanced brightness and higher spectral purity in the high-gain regime. We further investigate the performance of a single ring resonator as a two-mode squeezer by analyzing various performance metrics under experimentally relevant optical loss conditions.</description>

      <title>Solving an Industrially Relevant Quantum Chemistry Problem on Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemical calculations are among the most promising applications for quantum computing. Implementations of dedicated quantum algorithms on available quantum hardware were so far, however, mostly limited to comparatively simple systems without strong correlations. As such, they can also be addressed by classically efficient single-reference methods. In this work, we calculate the lowest energy eigenvalue of active space Hamiltonians of industrially relevant and strongly correlated metal chelates on trapped ion quantum hardware, and integrate the results into a typical industrial quantum chemical workflow to arrive at chemically meaningful properties. We are able to achieve chemical accuracy by training a variational quantum algorithm on quantum hardware, followed by a classical diagonalization in the subspace of states measured as outputs of the quantum circuit. This approach is particularly measurement-efficient, requiring 600 single-shot measurements per cost function evaluation on a ten qubit system, and allows for efficient post-processing to handle erroneous runs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Superdense Coding Capacity in the Non-Markovian Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superdense coding is a significant technique widely used in quantum information processing. Indeed, it consists of sending two bits of classical information using a single qubit, leading to faster and more efficient quantum communication. In this paper, we propose a model to evaluate the effect of backflow information in a superdense coding protocol through a non-Markovian dynamics. The model considers a qubit interacting with a structured Markovian environment. In order to generate a non-Markovian dynamic, an auxiliary qubit contacts a Markovian reservoir in such a way that the non-Markovian regime can be induced. By varying the coupling strength between the central qubit and the auxiliary qubit, the two dynamical regimes can be switched interchangeably. An enhancement in non-Markovian effects corresponds to an increase in this coupling strength. Furthermore, we conduct an examination of various parameters, namely temperature weight, and decoherence parameters in order to explore the behaviors of superdense coding, quantum Fisher information, and local quantum uncertainty using an exact calculation. The obtained results show a significant relationship between non-classical correlations and quantum Fisher information since they behave similarly, allowing them to detect what is beyond entanglement. In addition, the presence of non-classical correlations enables us to detect the optimal superdense coding capacity in a non-Markovian regime.</description>

      <title>An analogue of the P\"oschl-Teller anharmonic oscillator on an $N$-dimensional sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger particle on an $N$-dimensional ($N\geqslant2$) hypersphere of radius $R$ is considered. The particle is subjected to the action of a force characterized by the potential $V(\theta)=2m\omega_{1}^{2}R^{2}\tan^{2}(\theta/2)+2m\omega_{2}^{2}R^{2}\cot^{2}(\theta/2)$, where $0\leqslant\theta\leqslant\pi$ is the hyperlatitude angular coordinate. In the general case when $\omega_{1}\neq\omega_{2}$, this is a model of a hyperspherical analogue of the P\"oschl-Teller anharmonic oscillator. Energy eigenvalues and normalized eigenfunctions for this system are found in closed analytical forms. For $N=2$, our results reproduce those obtained by Kazaryan et al. [Physica E 52 (2013) 122]. For $N\geqslant2$ arbitrary and for $\omega_{2}=0$, the results of Mardoyan and Petrosyan [J. Contemp. Phys. 48 (2013) 70] for their model of an isotropic hyperspherical harmonic oscillator are recovered. The Euclidean limit for the anharmonic oscillator in question is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gleason and Kraus Theorems for hybrid classical-quantum probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose four axioms for hybrid classical-quantum probability measures that readily generalize the usual ones for classical and quantum probability measures. A generalized Gleason theorem that gives the mathematical form of the corresponding hybrid states is shown. This form simplifies when the classical subsystem probabilities are described by a probability density function with respect to a natural reference measure. We formulate a requirement for the transformations of hybrid probability measures analogous to the complete positive assumption for quantum operations. For hybrid systems with reference measure, we prove a generalized Kraus theorem that fully determines the considered transformations provided they are continuous with respect to an appropriate metric. Explicit expressions for these transformations are derived when the classical and quantum subsystems are non-interacting, the classical subsystem is discrete, or the Hilbert space of the quantum subsystem is finite-dimensional. We also discuss the quantification of the correlations between the classical and quantum subsystems and a generalization of the quantum operations usually considered in the study of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Proposal of an optical Bell's experiment to test the boundary between determinism and indeterminism in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently noted the existence of an apparently discontinuous boundary between determinism and indeterminism in Quantum Mechanics. We propose to explore this boundary in an optical Bell's experiment by recording the distribution, of the number of strings of outcomes of a given parity interrupted by outcomes of the other parity, as a function of their length. The features of these distributions for small rotations of the angle settings near critical points may indicate whether the underlying process is in-deterministic or not. Therefore, they may show that the boundary is discontinuous, or else, that determinism decays smoothly. The conditions the experimental setup must fulfill are discussed.</description>

      <title>SWAP-less Implementation of Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalism based on tracking the flow of parity quantum information to implement algorithms on devices with limited connectivity without qubit overhead, SWAP operations or shuttling. Instead, we leverage the fact that entangling gates not only manipulate quantum states but can also be exploited to transport quantum information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with $n$ qubits. This improves upon all state-of-the-art implementations of the QFT on a linear nearest-neighbor architecture, resulting in a total circuit depth of ${5n-3}$ and requiring ${n^2-1}$ CNOT gates. For the QAOA, our method outperforms SWAP networks, which are currently the most efficient implementation of the QAOA on a linear architecture. We further demonstrate the potential to balance qubit count against circuit depth by implementing the QAOA on twice the number of qubits using bi-linear connectivity, which approximately halves the circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Error threshold in active steering protocols for few-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study active steering protocols for weakly measured qubits in the presence of error channels due to amplitude and phase noise. If the error rate is sufficiently small, the protocol approaches and stabilizes a predesignated pure target state with high fidelity and high purity, and thus implements autonomous state stabilization. We present numerical simulation results for one and two qubits, taking Andreev qubit circuits as example. As function of the error rate, a sharp threshold separates an error-correcting weak-damping regime from a strong-damping regime where the target state cannot be reached anymore. At the threshold, the purity gap closes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of the spatial coherence of light that is radiated from a dilute ensemble of atoms. The spatial coherence is established as a result of the collective (cooperative) coupling of the atoms to the light, and is qualitatively different from the coherence of a laser. Specifically, the coherence in collective spontaneous emission does not rely on population inversion and stimulated emission, is governed by anti-phasing of the dipoles (subradiance), and the key figure-of-merit for the observed coherence is N /(L/{\lambda}) . Here, N is the number of atoms in the ensemble, L is the size of the sample, and {\lambda} is the wavelength of the emitted light.</description>

      <title>Bounding the systematic error in quantum error mitigation due to model violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is a promising route to achieving quantum utility, and potentially quantum advantage in the near-term. Many state-of-the-art error mitigation schemes use knowledge of the errors in the quantum processor, which opens the question to what extent inaccuracy in the error model impacts the performance of error mitigation. In this work, we develop a methodology to efficiently compute upper bounds on the impact of error-model inaccuracy in error mitigation. Our protocols require no additional experiments, and instead rely on comparisons between the error model and the error-learning data from which the model is generated. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology by deploying it on an IBM Quantum superconducting qubit quantum processor, and through numerical simulation of standard error models. We show that our estimated upper bounds are typically close to the worst observed performance of error mitigation on random circuits. Our methodology can also be understood as an operationally meaningful metric to assess the quality of error models, and we further extend our methodology to allow for comparison between error models. Finally, contrary to what one might expect we show that observable error in noisy layered circuits of sufficient depth is not always maximized by a Clifford circuit, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Microsatellite-based real-time quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum network provides an infrastructure connecting quantum devices with revolutionary computing, sensing, and communication capabilities. As the best-known application of a quantum network, quantum key distribution (QKD) shares secure keys guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. A quantum satellite constellation offers a solution to facilitate the quantum network on a global scale. The Micius satellite has verified the feasibility of satellite quantum communications, however, scaling up quantum satellite constellations is challenging, requiring small lightweight satellites, portable ground stations and real-time secure key exchange. Here we tackle these challenges and report the development of a quantum microsatellite capable of performing space-to-ground QKD using portable ground stations. The quantum microsatellite features a payload weighing approximately 23 kg, while the portable ground station weighs about 100 kg. These weights represent reductions by more than an order and two orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to the Micius satellite. Additionally, we multiplex bidirectional satellite-ground optical communication with quantum communication, enabling key distillation and secure communication in real-time. Using the microsatellite and the portable ground stations, we demonstrate satellite-based QKD with multiple ground stations and achieve the sharing of up to 0.59 million bits of secure keys during a single satellite pass. The compact quantum payload can be readily assembled on existing space stations or small satellites, paving the way for a satellite-constellation-based quantum and classical network for widespread real-life applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Shadow Tomography of Molecular Excited States from Enforcing $N$-representability Conditions by Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited-state properties of highly correlated systems are key to understanding photosynthesis, luminescence, and the development of novel optical materials, but accurately capturing their interactions is computationally costly. We present an algorithm that combines classical shadow tomography with physical constraints on the two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) to treat excited states. The method reduces the number of measurements of the many-electron 2-RDM on quantum computers by (i) approximating the quantum state through a random sampling technique called shadow tomography and (ii) ensuring that the 2-RDM represents an $N$-electron system through imposing $N$-representability constraints by semidefinite programming. This generalizes recent work on the $N$-representability-enhanced shadow tomography of ground-state 2-RDMs. We compute excited-state energies and 2-RDMs of the H$_4$ chain and analyze the critical points along the photoexcited reaction pathway from gauche-1,3-butadiene to bicyclobutane via a conical intersection. The results show that the generalized shadow tomography retains critical multireference correlation effects while significantly reducing the number of required measurements, offering a promising avenue for the efficient treatment of electronically excited states on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Shadow Ansatz for the Many-Fermion Wave Function in Scalable Molecular Simulations on Quantum Computing Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we show that shadow tomography can generate an efficient and exact ansatz for the many-fermion wave function on quantum devices. We derive the shadow ansatz -- a product of transformations applied to the mean-field wave function -- by exploiting a critical link between measurement and preparation. Each transformation is obtained by measuring a classical shadow of the residual of the contracted Schr\"odinger equation (CSE), the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation (SE) projected onto the space of two electrons. We show that the classical shadows of the CSE vanish if and only if the wave function satisfies the SE and, hence, that randomly sampling only the two-electron space yields an exact ansatz regardless of the total number of electrons. We demonstrate the ansatz's advantages for scalable simulations -- fewer measurements and shallower circuits -- by computing H$_{3}$ on simulators and a quantum device.</description>

Abstract: The advent of quantum computers has justified the development of quantum machine learning algorithms , based on the adaptation of the principles of machine learning to the formalism of qubits. Among such quantum algorithms, anomaly detection represents an important problem crossing several disciplines from cybersecurity, to fraud detection to particle physics. We summarize the key concepts involved in quantum computing, introducing the formal concept of quantum speed up. The survey provides a structured map of anomaly detection based on quantum machine learning. We have grouped existing algorithms according to the different learning methods, namely quantum supervised, quantum unsupervised and quantum reinforcement learning, respectively. We provide an estimate of the hardware resources to provide sufficient computational power in the future. The survey provides a systematic and compact understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. We eventually provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the learning methods in real application domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of phase time, which has been previously proposed as a solution to the problem of time in quantum gravity. Concretely, we show how the geometry of configuration space together with the phase of the wave function of the universe can, under certain conditions, lead to the definition of a positive-definite inner product from which probabilities can be defined. The norm is conserved under time evolution, and we obtain a version of Ehrenfest's theorem that is analogous to the one in ordinary quantum mechanics. We address how the present approach avoids some difficulties that were encountered in previous attempts at defining an Ehrenfest theorem relative to phase time in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics and canonical quantum gravity, and how it is connected to a notion of gauge fixing the inner product. We conclude with a brief outlook.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo: solution to Majorana sign ambiguity and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), formulated in complex-fermion representation, has played a key role in studying strongly-correlated fermion systems. However, its applicability is limited due to the requirement of particle-number conservation after Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. In going beyond the conventional DQMC, one encouraging development occurred when Majorana fermions were introduced for QMC [1,2]. But in previous Majorana-based QMC, Boltzmann weight is determined often with a sign ambiguity. Here we successfully resolved this ambiguity by deriving a closed-form Pfaffian formula for the weight, enabling efficient calculation of the weight with its sign in polynomial time. We call it ''Pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo'' (PfQMC), which can be applied to generic interacting fermion models. We have successfully employed PfQMC to explore how robust Majorana edge modes in Kitaev chain are against strong interactions. By offering greater flexibility, PfQMC can potentially enhance existing sign-mitigating and approximation methods and help address challenging issues such as the ground-state properties of the doped Hubbard model.</description>

Abstract: While it is possible to estimate the dark matter density at the Sun distance from the galactic center, this does not give information on actual dark matter density in the Solar system. There can be considerable local enhancement of dark matter density in the vicinity of gravitating centers, including the Sun, the Earth, as well as other planets in the solar system. Generic mechanisms for the formation of such halos were recently elucidated. In this work, we studies the possible halo dark matter overdensities and corresponding dark matter masses allowed for various objects in the solar system. We explore spacecraft missions to detect such halos with instruments such as quantum clocks, atomic and molecular spectrometers designed to search for fast (tens of hertz to gigahertz) oscillations of fundamental constants, highly sensitive comagnetometers, and other quantum sensors and sensor networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing based on solid-state spin defects provides a uniquely versatile platform for imaging physical properties at the nanoscale under diverse environmental conditions. Operation of most sensors used to-date is based on projective measurement along a single axis combined with computational extrapolation. Here, we show that the individually addressable carbon-related spin defect in hexagonal boron nitride is a multi-axis spin system for vectorial nanoscale magnetometry. We demonstrate how its low symmetry and strongly spin-selective direct and reverse intersystem crossing dynamics provide sub-$\mu$T/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ magnetic-field sensitivity for both on and off-axis bias magnetic field exceeding 50 mT. Alongside these features, the room-temperature operation and the nanometer-scale proximity enabled by the van der Waals host material further consolidate this system as an exciting quantum sensing platform.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Straintronics and Mechanical Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Quasi-metallic SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are effectively narrow ribbons of 2D materials with atomically precise edges. They are ideal systems to harness quantum transport straintronics (QTS), i.e. using mechanical strain to control quantum transport. Their large subband energy spacing ($\sim$ 0.8 eV) leads to transistors with a single quantum transport channel. We adapt an applied model to study QTS in uniaxially-strained quasi-metallic-SWCNT transistors. The device parameters are based on an existing experimental platform, with channel lengths of $L=$ 50 nm, diameters $d\approx$ 1.5 nm, and strains up to $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}\approx$ 7 $\%$. We demonstrate that the charge carrier's propagation angle $\Theta$ is fully tunable with $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}$. When $\Theta$ reaches 90$^o$, the conductance $G$ is completely suppressed. A strain-generated band gap can be tuned up to $\approx$ 400 meV. Mechanical strain adds both scalar $\phi_{\varepsilon}$ and vector $\textbf{A}$ gauge potentials to the transistor's Hamiltonian. These potentials create a rich spectrum of quantum interferences in $G$, which can be described as a mechanical Aharonov-Bohm effect. The charge carriers' quantum phase can be controlled by purely mechanical means. For instance, a full 2$\pi$ phase shift can be induced in a (12,9) tube by a 0.7 $\%$ strain change. This work opens opportunities to add quantitative quantum transport strain effects to the tools box of quantum technologies based on 2D materials and their nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable circular polarization medium frequency atomic receiver using magneto-electric effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear magnetoelectric effect(NME) in alkali atomic vapor has applications in precision magnetometry in the radio-frequency domain. We report the application of the NME in alkali atomic vapors for projective measurement of medium-frequency (MF) magnetic fields in a circular basis with an extinction ratio up to 500:1 . Utilizing a longitudinal static magnetic field, we demonstrate a high-sensitivity technique for characterizing the ellipticity of radio-frequency (RF) magnetic fields which can in turn be used for phase sensitive detection in mid frequency communication. Additionally, we demonstrate the conversion of binary phase shift keyed RF magnetic fields into amplitude modulation of generated optical fields, a versatile receiver for communication using the medium frequency band.</description>

      <title>Microwave-driven multistability in a strongly interacting Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions between Rydberg atoms and microwave fields provide a valuable framework for studying the complex dynamics out of equilibrium, exotic phases, and critical phenomena in many-body physics. This unique interplay allows us to explore various regimes of nonlinearity and phase transitions. Here, we observe a phase transition from the state in the regime of bistability to that in multistability in a strongly interacting Rydberg atoms by varying the microwave field intensity, accompanying with the breaking of Z3-symmetry. During the phase transition, the system experiences a hidden critical point, in which the multistable states are difficult to be identified. Through changing the initial state of system, we can identify a hidden multistable state and reveal a hidden trajectory of phase transition, allowing us to track to a hidden critical point. In addition, we observe multiple phase transitions in spectra, suggesting higher-order symmetry breaking. The reported results shed light on manipulating multistability in dissipative Rydberg atoms systems and hold promise in the applications of non-equilibrium many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has ushered in a new era of observing the universe. Quantum resource advantages offer significant enhancements to the sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories. While squeezed states for ground-based gravitational wave detection have received marked attention, the generation of squeezed states suitable for mid-to-low-frequency detection has remained unexplored. To address the gap in squeezed state optical fields at ultra-low frequencies, we report on the first direct observation of a squeezed vacuum field until Fourier frequency of 4 millihertz with the quantum noise reduction of up to 8 dB, by the employment of a multiple noise suppression scheme. Our work provides quantum resources for future gravitational wave observatories, facilitating the development of quantum precision measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the tensor tree network with the Born machine framework, we propose a general method for constructing a generative model by expressing the target distribution function as the quantum wave function amplitude represented by a tensor tree. The key idea is dynamically optimizing the tree structure that minimizes the bond mutual information. The proposed method offers enhanced performance and uncovers hidden relational structures in the target data. We illustrate potential practical applications with four examples: (i) random patterns, (ii) QMNIST hand-written digits, (iii) Bayesian networks, and (iv) the stock price fluctuation pattern in S&amp;P500. In (i) and (ii), strongly correlated variables were concentrated near the center of the network; in (iii), the causality pattern was identified; and, in (iv), a structure corresponding to the eleven sectors emerged.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a single spin coupled to a bosonic bath at zero temperature driven by a ramp of the bias field. A single spin coupled to a bosonic sub-Ohmic bath exhibits a quantum phase transition at a certain strength of spin-boson coupling. When the bias field is ramped from a large value to zero at this critical coupling strength, the system initialized at the ground state ends up with a finite magnetization due to the critical slowing down near the transition. On the basis of the pulse-impulse approximation, we derive a scaling law between the residual magnetization and the ramp speed. The obtained scaling relation is examined using a numerical simulation based on the tensor network. The data are in favor of the scaling law to hold. We discuss the demonstration of our theoretical results by means of quantum simulation using the quantum annealer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for characterizing the localization properties of wave functions. Despite its utility, this tool has been predominantly applied to disordered Hermitian systems. Multifractal statistics associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the tree geometry induces multifractal statistics for the single-particle skin states on the Cayley tree. This sharply contrasts with the absence of multifractal properties for conventional single-particle skin effects in crystalline lattices. Our work uncovers the unique feature of the skin effect on the Cayley tree and provides a novel mechanism for inducing multifractality in open quantum systems without disorder.</description>

      <title>Persistent Ballistic Entanglement Spreading with Optimal Control in Quantum Spin Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement propagation provides a key routine to understand quantum many-body dynamics in and out of equilibrium. The entanglement entropy (EE) usually approaches to a sub-saturation known as the Page value $\tilde{S}_{P} =\tilde{S} - dS$ (with $\tilde{S}$ the maximum of EE and $dS$ the Page correction) in, e.g., the random unitary evolutions. The ballistic spreading of EE usually appears in the early time and will be deviated far before the Page value is reached. In this work, we uncover that the magnetic field that maximizes the EE robustly induces persistent ballistic spreading of entanglement in quantum spin chains. The linear growth of EE is demonstrated to persist till the maximal $\tilde{S}$ (along with a flat entanglement spectrum) is reached. The robustness of ballistic spreading and the enhancement of EE under such an optimal control are demonstrated, considering particularly perturbing the initial state by random pure states (RPS's). These are argued as the results from the endomorphism of the time evolution under such an entanglement-enhancing optimal control for the RPS's.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate correlations, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and quantum information dynamics in chaotic many-body quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the statistical properties of eigenstates of the time-evolution operator in chaotic many-body quantum systems. Our focus is on correlations between eigenstates that are specific to spatially extended systems and that characterise entanglement dynamics and operator spreading. In order to isolate these aspects of dynamics from those arising as a result of local conservation laws, we consider Floquet systems in which there are no conserved densities. The correlations associated with scrambling of quantum information lie outside the standard framework established by the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH). In particular, ETH provides a statistical description of matrix elements of local operators between pairs of eigenstates, whereas the aspects of dynamics we are concerned with arise from correlations amongst sets of four or more eigenstates. We establish the simplest correlation function that captures these correlations and discuss features of its behaviour that are expected to be universal at long distances and low energies. We also propose a maximum-entropy Ansatz for the joint distribution of a small number $n$ of eigenstates. In the case $n = 2$ this Ansatz reproduces ETH. For $n = 4$ it captures both the growth with time of entanglement between subsystems, as characterised by the purity of the time-evolution operator, and also operator spreading, as characterised by the behaviour of the out-of-time-order correlator. We test these ideas by comparing results from Monte Carlo sampling of our Ansatz with exact diagonalisation studies of Floquet quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the pump mode in the down-conversion Hamiltonian using the cumulant expansion method, perturbation theory, and the full numerical simulation of systems with a pump mean photon number of up to one hundred thousand. We particularly focus on the properties of the pump-mode such as depletion, entanglement, and squeezing for an experimentally relevant initial state in which the pump mode is initialized in a coherent state. Through this analysis, we obtain the short-time behaviour of various quantities and derive timescales at which the above-mentioned features, which cannot be understood through the parametric approximation, originate in the system. We also provide an entanglement witness involving moments of bosonic operators that can capture the entanglement of the pump mode. Finally, we study the photon-number statistics of the pump and the signal/idler modes to understand the general behaviour of these modes for experimentally relevant time scales.</description>

Abstract: Phase-sensitive amplification of squeezed states is a technique to mitigate high detection loss, e.g. at 2-micrometre wavelengths. Our analytical model of amplified squeezed states expands on the effect of phase noise and derives two practical parameters: the effective measurable squeezing and the effective detection efficiency. A case study including realistic parameters demonstrates the benefit of phase-sensitive amplification. We identified the phase noise in the optical parametric amplifier (OPA) minimally affects the squeezing level, enabling increased gain of the OPA. This scheme is compatible with proposed gravitational-wave detectors and consistent with applications in quantum systems that are degraded by output coupling loss in optical waveguides.</description>

      <title>Passive decoy-state quantum secure direct communication with heralded single-photon source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum secure direct communications (QSDC) can directly transmit secret messages through a quantum channel without keys. The imperfect photon source is a major obstacle for QSDC's practical implementation. The unwanted vacuum state and multiphoton components emitted from imperfect photon source largely reduce QSDC's secrecy message capacity and even threaten its security. In the paper, we propose a high-efficient passive decoy-state QSDC protocol with the heralded single-photon source (HSPS). We adopt a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source to emit entangled photon pairs in two spatial modes. By detecting the photons in one of the two correlated spatial modes, we can infer the photon-number distribution of the other spatial mode. Meanwhile, our protocol allows a simple passive preparation of the signal states and decoy state. The HSPS can effectively reduce the probability of vacuum state and increase QSDC's secrecy message capacity. Meanwhile, the passive decoy-state method can simplify the experimental operations and enhance QSDC's robustness against the third-party side-channel attacks. Under the communication distance of 10 km, the secrecy message capacity of our QSDC protocol can achieve 81.85 times with average photon number of 0.1 and 12.79 times with average photon number of 0.01 of that in the original single-photon-based QSDC protocol without the HSPS. Our QSDC protocol has longer maximal communication distance about 17.975 km with average photon number of 0.01. Our work serves as a major step toward the further development of practical passive decoy-state QSDC systems.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Resource Estimation for the Development of Quantum Computing Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has made considerable progress in recent years in both software and hardware. But to unlock the power of quantum computers in solving problems that cannot be efficiently solved classically, quantum computing at scale is necessary. Unfortunately, quantum simulators suffer from their exponential complexity and, at the same time, the currently available quantum computing hardware is still rather limited (even if roadmaps make intriguing promises). Hence, in order to evaluate quantum computing applications, end-users are still frequently restricted to toy-size problem instances (which additionally often do not take error correction into account). This substantially hinders the development and assessment of real-world quantum computing applications. In this work, we demonstrate how to utilize Resource Estimation to improve this situation. We show how the current workflow (relying on simulation and/or execution) can be complemented with an estimation step, allowing that end-users (1) actually can consider real-world problem instances already today (also considering error correction schemes and correspondingly required hardware resources), (2) can start exploring possible optimizations of those instances across the entire design space, and (3) can incorporate hypotheses of hardware development trends to derive more informed and, thus, better design space parameters. Overall, this enables end-users already today to check out the promises of possible future quantum computing applications, even if the corresponding hardware to execute them is not available yet.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead non-Clifford fault-tolerant circuits for all non-chiral abelian topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits on a 2-dimensional planar grid of qudits, realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected fault-tolerant memory. These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non-Abelian phases. In the appendix we present an explicit combinatorial procedure to define formulas for higher cup products on arbitrary cellulations, which might be interesting in its own right to the TQFT and topological-phases community.</description>

Abstract: Lindblad dynamics and other open-system dynamics provide a promising path towards efficient Gibbs sampling on quantum computers. In these proposals, the Lindbladian is obtained via an algorithmic construction akin to designing an artificial thermostat in classical Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics methods, rather than treated as an approximation to weakly coupled system-bath unitary dynamics. Recently, Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en (arXiv:2311.09207) introduced the first efficiently implementable Lindbladian satisfying the Kubo--Martin--Schwinger (KMS) detailed balance condition, which ensures that the Gibbs state is a fixed point of the dynamics and is applicable to non-commuting Hamiltonians. This Gibbs sampler uses a continuously parameterized set of jump operators, and the energy resolution required for implementing each jump operator depends only logarithmically on the precision and the mixing time. In this work, we build upon the structural characterization of KMS detailed balanced Lindbladians by Fagnola and Umanit\`a, and develop a family of efficient quantum Gibbs samplers using a finite set of jump operators (the number can be as few as one), akin to the classical Markov chain-based sampling algorithm. Compared to the existing works, our quantum Gibbs samplers have a comparable quantum simulation cost but with greater design flexibility and a much simpler implementation and error analysis. Moreover, it encompasses the construction of Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en as a special instance.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Quantum Machine Learning Generalization to Significantly Speed-up Quantum Compilation</title>

Abstract: Existing numerical optimizers deployed in quantum compilers use expensive $\mathcal{O}(4^n)$ matrix-matrix operations. Inspired by recent advances in quantum machine learning (QML), QFactor-Sample replaces matrix-matrix operations with simpler $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ circuit simulations on a set of sample inputs. The simpler the circuit, the lower the number of required input samples. We validate QFactor-Sample on a large set of circuits and discuss its hyperparameter tuning. When incorporated in the BQSKit quantum compiler and compared against a state-of-the-art domain-specific optimizer, We demonstrate improved scalability and a reduction in compile time, achieving an average speedup factor of 69 for circuits with more than 8 qubits. We also discuss how improved numerical optimization affects the dynamics of partitioning-based compilation schemes, which allow a trade-off between compilation speed and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Visual Feature Encoding Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although quantum machine learning has been introduced for a while, its applications in computer vision are still limited. This paper, therefore, revisits the quantum visual encoding strategies, the initial step in quantum machine learning. Investigating the root cause, we uncover that the existing quantum encoding design fails to ensure information preservation of the visual features after the encoding process, thus complicating the learning process of the quantum machine learning models. In particular, the problem, termed "Quantum Information Gap" (QIG), leads to a gap of information between classical and corresponding quantum features. We provide theoretical proof and practical demonstrations of that found and underscore the significance of QIG, as it directly impacts the performance of quantum machine learning algorithms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a simple but efficient new loss function named Quantum Information Preserving (QIP) to minimize this gap, resulting in enhanced performance of quantum machine learning algorithms. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing superior performance compared to current methodologies and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results in quantum modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a machine-learning-based procedure to automate the charge tuning of semiconductor spin qubits with minimal human intervention, addressing one of the significant challenges in scaling up quantum dot technologies. This method exploits artificial neural networks to identify noisy transition lines in stability diagrams, guiding a robust exploration strategy leveraging neural networks' uncertainty estimations. Tested across three distinct offline experimental datasets representing different single quantum dot technologies, the approach achieves over 99% tuning success rate in optimal cases, where more than 10% of the success is directly attributable to uncertainty exploitation. The challenging constraints of small training sets containing high diagram-to-diagram variability allowed us to evaluate the capabilities and limits of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>The geometry of the Hermitian matrix space and the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the Schrieffer--Wolff (SW) transformation (also called quasi-degenerate perturbation theory) is known as an approximative method to reduce the dimension of the Hamiltonian. We present a geometric interpretation of the SW transformation: We prove that it induces a local coordinate chart in the space of Hermitian matrices near a $k$-fold degeneracy submanifold. Inspired by this result, we establish a `distance theorem': we show that the standard deviation of $k$ neighboring eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian equals the distance of this Hamiltonian from the corresponding $k$-fold degeneracy submanifold, divided by $\sqrt{k}$. Furthermore, we investigate one-parameter perturbations of a degenerate Hamiltonian, and prove that the standard deviation and the pairwise differences of the eigenvalues lead to the same order of splitting of the energy eigenvalues, which in turn is the same as the order of distancing from the degeneracy submanifold. As applications, we prove the `protection' of Weyl points using the transversality theorem, and infer geometrical properties of certain degeneracy submanifolds based on results from quantum error correction and topological order.</description>

      <title>Lowering Connectivity Requirements For Bivariate Bicycle Codes Using Morphing Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Bravyi et al. [1] proposed a set of small quantum Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes that achieve a similar circuit-level error rate to the surface code but with an improved encoding rate. In this work, we generalise a novel parity-check circuit design principle that we call morphing circuits (first introduced in [2]) and apply this methodology to BB codes. Our construction generates a new family of BB codes -- including a new $[[144,12,12]]$ "gross" code -- whose parity check circuits require a qubit connectivity of degree five instead of six. Intriguingly, each parity check circuit requires only 6 rounds of CNOT gates -- one fewer than in Ref. [1] -- even though our new codes have weight-9 stabilisers. We also show how to perform logical input/output circuits to an ancillary rotated surface code using morphing circuits, all within a biplanar layout. The new codes perform at least as well as those of Ref. [1] under uniform circuit-level noise when decoded using BP-OSD. Finally, we develop a general framework for designing morphing circuits and present a sufficient condition for its applicability to two-block group algebra codes.

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Energy Teleportation using a 3-Qubit System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a novel method that leverages quantum entanglement to transfer energy between two distant locations without any physical movement of the energy. The first realization of QET on superconducting hardware, utilizing a 2-qubit system, demonstrated an average energy retrieval efficiency of 11.4% by the receiver, Bob. In this paper, we present a new approach using a 3-qubit system to enhance the energy efficiency of QET. We have incorporated a novel 3-qubit ground state hamiltonian H to achieve this, that conforms the constraints of Zero mean energy. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in energy retrieval, achieving an average efficiency of 46.4%, which is significantly higher than that of the 2-qubit system. This advancement not only marks a step forward in practical quantum energy applications but also provides a new framework for future research in quantum energy teleportation and related quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A universal neutral-atom quantum computer with individual optical addressing and non-destructive readout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-10]. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation will greatly extend runtimes for useful, large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with sub-percent loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure 99.73(3)% CZ fidelity with atom-loss events excluded, which is a record among long lived neutral-atom qubits and highlights the path to higher fidelity and error correction. Our results represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, quantifying circuit complexity remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces Character Complexity, a novel measure that bridges Group-theoretic concepts with practical quantum computing concerns. By leveraging tools from representation theory, I prove several key properties of character complexity and establish a surprising connection to the classical simulability of quantum circuits. This new measure offers a fresh perspective on the complexity landscape of quantum algorithms, potentially reshaping our understanding of quantum-classical computational boundaries. I present innovative visualization methods for character complexity, providing intuitive insights into the structure of quantum circuits. The empirical results reveal intriguing scaling behaviors with respect to qubit and gate counts, opening new avenues for quantum algorithm design and optimization. This work not only contributes to the theoretical foundations of quantum complexity but also offers practical tools for the quantum computing community. As quantum hardware continues to advance, character complexity could play a crucial role in developing more efficient quantum algorithms and in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: The comprehension of quantum phase transitions (QPTs) is considered as a critical foothold in the field of many-body physics. Developing protocols to effectively identify and understand QPTs thus represents a key but challenging task for present quantum simulation experiments. Here, we establish a dynamical quench-interferometric framework to probe a zero-temperature QPT, which utilizes the evolved state by quenching the QPT Hamiltonian as input of a unitary interferometer. The metrological capability quantified by the quantum Fisher information captivatingly shows an unique peak in the vicinity of the quantum critical point, allowing us to probe the QPT without cooling the system to its ground state. We show that the probing can be implemented by extracting quantum fluctuations of the interferometric generator as well as parameter estimation uncertainty of the interferometric phase, and subsequently allows identifying the boundary of the phase diagram. Our results establish an important link between QPTs and quantum metrology, and enrich the toolbox of studying non-equilibrium many-body physics in current quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: We review the correspondence between a synchronous game and its associated game algebra. We slightly develop the work of Helton et al.[HMPS17] by proposing results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based on the theoretical works on noncommutative Nullstellens\"atze [BWHK23], we build computational tools involving Gr\"obner basis method and semidefinite programming to check the existence of perfect strategies with specific models. We prove the equivalence between the hereditary and $C^*$ models proposed in [HMPS17]. We also extend Ji's reduction $\texttt{3-Coloring}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$ [Ji13] and exhibit another instance of quantum-version NP-hardness reduction $\texttt{Clique}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$.</description>

Abstract: If time has three dimensions, how does a particle move? This paper demonstrates that quantum physics naturally emerges from a framework
  of three-dimensional time. We present the equations governing the motion of 0-spin, 1-spin, and 1/2-spin particles within this three-dimensional time model. Phenomena such as quantum non-locality, spin, gauge transformation invariance, Bose-Einstein condensation, the exclusion principle, and Schr\"odinger's cat problem are shown to arise due to the presence of two additional time dimensions. We will explore how causality is maintained in this multi-dimensional time framework. Additionally, we will demonstrate that gravitational and electromagnetic fields can be unified within the 3+3 space-time Kaluza-Klein (KK) equations. Furthermore, a strong-interaction equation based on the $\sigma-\omega$ model is derived from the geometry of three-dimensional time for fermions. Finally, we show that gravitational, electromagnetic, and strong interactions can be unified within the same six-dimensional Kaluza-Klein equation.

Abstract: This review is a contribution to a book dedicated to the memory of Michael E. Fisher. The first example of a quantum many body system not expected to have any quasiparticle excitations was the Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory. The absence of quasiparticles can be established in the compressible, metallic state of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of fermions with random interactions. The solvability of the latter model has enabled numerous computations of the non-quasiparticle dynamics of chaotic many-body states, such as those expected to describe quantum black holes. We review thermodynamic properties of the SYK model, and describe how they have led to an understanding of the universal structure of the low energy density of states of charged black holes without low energy supersymmetry.</description>

Abstract: Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</description>

Abstract: Calculation of observables with three-dimensional projected entangled pair states is generally hard, as it requires a contraction of complex multi-layer tensor networks. We utilize the multi-layer structure of these tensor networks to largely simplify the contraction. The proposed approach involves the usage of the layer structure both to simplify the search for the boundary projected entangled pair states and the single-layer mapping of the final corner transfer matrix renormalization group contraction. We benchmark our results on the cubic lattice Heisenberg model, reaching the bond dimension D = 7, and find a good agreement with the previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions that carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped ``flag'' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that such uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (i) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (ii) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (iii) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave the way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthetic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>

Abstract: Precise assessment of the mechanical properties of soft biological systems at the nanoscale is crucial for understanding physiology, pathology, and developing relevant drugs. Conventional atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based indentation methods suffer from uncertainties in local tip-sample interactions and model choice. This can be overcome by adopting spatially resolved nonlocal deformation sensing for mechanical analysis. However, the technique is currently limited to lifeless/static systems, due to the inadequate spatial or temporal resolution, or difficulties in differentiating the indentation-induced deformation from that associated with live activities and other external perturbations. Here, we develop an innovative dynamic nonlocal deformation sensing approach allowing both spatially and temporally resolved mechanical analysis, which achieves a tens of microsecond time-lag precision, a nanometer vertical deformation precision, and a sub-hundred nanometer lateral spatial resolution. Using oscillatory nanoindentation and spectroscopic analysis, the method can separate the indentation-caused signal from random noise, enabling live cell measurement. Using this method, we discover a distance-dependent phase of surface deformation during indentation, leading to the disclosure of surface tension effects (capillarity) in the mechanical response of live cells upon AFM indentation. A viscoelastic model with surface tension is used to enable simultaneous quantification of the viscoelasticity and capillarity of cell. We show that neglecting surface tension, as in conventional AFM methods, would underestimate the liquid-like characteristics and overestimate the apparent viscoelastic modulus of cells. The study lays down a foundation for understanding a broad range of elastocapillarity-related interfacial mechanics and mechanobiological processes in live cells.</description>
