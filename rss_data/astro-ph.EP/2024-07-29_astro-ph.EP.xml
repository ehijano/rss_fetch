      <title>Not So Fast: A New Catalog of Meteor Persistent Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a nearly two year long campaign to detect and analyze meteor persistent trains (PTs) - self-emitting phenomena which can linger up to an hour after their parent meteor. The modern understanding of PTs has been primarily developed from the Leonid storms at the turn of the century; our goal was to assess the validity of these conclusions using a diverse sample of meteors with a wide range of velocities and magnitudes. To this end, year-round observations were recorded by the Widefield Persistent Train camera, 2nd edition (WiPT2) and were passed through a pipeline to filter out airplanes and flag potential meteors. These were classified by visual inspection based on the presence and duration of trains. Observed meteors were cross-referenced with the Global Meteor Network (GMN) database, which independently detects and calculates meteor parameters, enabling statistical analysis of PT-leaving meteors. There were 4726 meteors codetected by the GMN, with 636 of these leaving trains. Among these were a large population of slow, dim meteors that left PTs; these slower meteors had a greater train production rate relative to their faster counterparts. Unlike prior research, we did not find a clear magnitude cutoff or a strong association with fast meteor showers. Additionally, we note several interesting trends not previously reported, which include PT eligibility being primarily determined by a meteor's terminal height and an apparent dynamical origin dependence that likely reflects physical meteoroid properties.</description>

      <title>Binary orbit and disks properties of the RW Aur system using ALMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical interactions between young binaries can perturb the material distribution of their circumstellar disks, and modify the planet formation process. In order to constrain the impact and nature of the binary interaction in the RW Aur system (bound or unbound), we analyzed the circumstellar material at 1.3 mm wavelengths, as observed at multiple epochs by ALMA. We analyzed the disk properties through parametric visibility modeling, and we used this information to constrain the dust morphology and the binary orbital period. We imaged the dust continuum emission of RW Aur with a resolution of 3 au, and we find that the radius enclosing 90% of the flux (R90%) is 19 au and 14 au for RW Aur A and B, respectively. By modeling the relative distance of the disks at each epoch, we find a consistent trend of movement for the disk of RW Aur B moving away from the disk of RW Aur A at an approximate rate of 3 mas/yr (about 0.5 au/yr in sky-projected distance). By combining ALMA astrometry, historical astrometry, and the dynamical masses of each star, we constrain the RW Aur binary stars to be most likely in a high-eccentricity elliptical orbit with a clockwise prograde orientation relative to RW Aur A, although low-eccentricity hyperbolic orbits are not ruled out by the astrometry. Our analysis does not exclude the possibility of a disk collision during the last interaction, which occurred $295_{-74}^{+21}$ yr ago relative to beginning of 2024. Evidence for the close interaction is found in a tentative warp of 6 deg in the inner 3 au of the disk of RW Aur A, in the brightness temperature of both disks, and in the morphology of the gas emission. A narrow ring that peaks at 6 au around RW Aur B is suggestive of captured material from the disk around RW Aur A.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of upper atmosphere density measurement on the ISS by observations of the CXB transmitted through the Earth rim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the upper atmosphere at ~100 km are important to investigate climate change, space weather forecasting, and the interaction between the Sun and the Earth. Atmospheric occultations of cosmic X-ray sources are an effective technique to measure the neutral density in the upper atmosphere. We are developing the instrument SUIM dedicated to continuous observations of atmospheric occultations. SUIM will be mounted on a platform on the exterior of the International Space Station for six months and pointed at the Earth's rim to observe atmospheric absorption of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB). In this paper, we conducted a feasibility study of SUIM by estimating the CXB statistics and the fraction of the non-X-ray background (NXB) in the observed data. The estimated CXB statistics are enough to evaluate the atmospheric absorption of CXB for every 15 km of altitude. On the other hand, the NXB will be dominant in the X-ray spectra of SUIM. Assuming that the NXB per detection area of SUIM is comparable to that of the soft X-ray Imager onboard Hitomi, the NXB level will be much higher than the CXB one and account for ~80% of the total SUIM spectra.</description>

      <title>REMIX SPH -- improving mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations using a generalised, material-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present REMIX, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme designed to alleviate effects that typically suppress mixing and instability growth at density discontinuities in SPH simulations. We approach this problem by directly targeting sources of kernel smoothing error and discretisation error, resulting in a generalised, material-independent formulation that improves the treatment both of discontinuities within a single material, for example in an ideal gas, and of interfaces between dissimilar materials. This approach also leads to improvements in capturing hydrodynamic behaviour unrelated to mixing, such as in shocks. We demonstrate marked improvements in three-dimensional test scenarios, focusing on more challenging cases with particles of equal mass across the simulation. This validates our methods for use-cases relevant across applications spanning astrophysics and engineering, where particles are free to evolve over a large range of density scales, or where emergent and evolving density discontinuities cannot easily be corrected by choosing bespoke particle masses in the initial conditions. We achieve these improvements while maintaining sharp discontinuities; without introducing additional equation of state dependence in, for example, particle volume elements; and without contrived or targeted corrections. Our methods build upon a fully compressible and thermodynamically consistent core-SPH construction, retaining Galilean invariance as well as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. REMIX is integrated in the open-source, state-of-the-art \swift code and is designed with computational efficiency in mind, which means that its improved hydrodynamic treatment can be used for high-resolution simulations without significant cost to run-speed.</description>

      <title>TESSILATOR: a one-stop shop for measuring TESS rotation periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a software package designed to produce photometric lightcurves and measure rotation periods from full-frame images taken by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which we name ``TESSILATOR''. TESSILATOR is the only publicly-available code that will run a full lightcurve and rotation period ($P_{\rm rot}$) analysis based on just a (list of) target identifier(s) or sky position(s) via a simple command-line prompt. This paper sets out to introduce the rationale for developing TESSILATOR, and then describes the methods, considerations and assumptions for: extracting photometry; dealing with potential contamination; accounting for natural and instrumental systematic effects; lightcurve normalisation and detrending; removing outliers and unreliable data; and finally, measuring the $P_{\rm rot}$ value and several periodogram attributes. Our methods have been tuned specifically to optimise TESS lightcurves and are independent from the pipelines developed by the TESS Science Processing Operations Center, meaning TESSILATOR can, in principle, analyse {\it any} target across the entire celestial sphere.
  We compare TESSILATOR $P_{\rm rot}$ measurements with TESS-SPOC-derived lightcurves of 1,560 (mainly FGKM-type) stars across four benchmark open clusters (Pisces-Eridanus, the Pleiades, the Hyades and Praesepe) and a sample of nearby field M-dwarfs. From a vetted subsample of 864 targets we find an excellent return of $P_{\rm rot}$ matches for the first 3 open clusters ($&gt;85$ per cent) and a moderate ($\sim 60$ per cent) match for the 700 Myr Praesepe and MEarth sample, which validates TESSILATOR as a tool for measuring $P_{\rm rot}$. The TESSILATOR code is available at \url{https://github.com/alexbinks/tessilator}.</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation: I. Fixed points and librating orbits of the Brown Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In hierarchical triple systems, the inner binary is slowly perturbed by a distant companion, giving rise to large-scale oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, known as von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. Stable systems with a mild hierarchy, where the period ratio is not too small, require an additional corrective term, known as the Brown Hamiltonian, to adequately account for their long-term evolution. Although the Brown Hamiltonian has been used to accurately describe the highly eccentric systems on circulating orbits where the periapse completes a complete revolution, the analysis near its elliptical fixed points had been overlooked. We derive analytically the modified fixed points including the Brown Hamiltonian and analyse its librating orbits (where the periapse motion is limited in range). We compare our result to the direct three-body integrations of millions of orbits and discuss the regimes of validity. We numerically discover the regions of orbital instability, allowed and forbidden librating zones with a complex, fractal, structure. The retrograde orbits, where the mutual inclination is $\iota &gt; 90\ \rm deg$, are more stable and allowed to librate for larger areas of the parameter space. We find numerical fits for the librating-circulating boundary. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications for systems of satellites, stars and compact objects. In a companion paper (paper II), we apply our formalism to the orbits of irregular satellites around giant planets.</description>

      <title>Local Spherical Collapsing Box in Athena++: Numerical Implementation and Benchmark Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a local model for a spherical collapsing/expanding gas cloud into the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamic code. This local model consists of a Cartesian periodic box with time-dependent geometry. We present a series of benchmark test problems, including non-linear solutions and linear perturbations of the local model, confirming the code's desired performance. During a spherical collapse, a horizontal shear flow is amplified, corresponding to angular momentum conservation of zonal flows in the global problem; wave speed and amplitude of sound waves increase in the local frame, due to the reduction in the characteristic length scale of the box, which can lead to an anisotropic effective sound speed in the local box. Our code conserves both mass and momentum to machine precision. This numerical implementation of the local model has potential applications to the study of local physics and hydrodynamic instabilities during protostellar collapse, providing a powerful framework for better understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation.</description>
