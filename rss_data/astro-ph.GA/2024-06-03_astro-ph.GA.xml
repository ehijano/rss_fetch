      <title>The eventful life of GS-z14-0, the most distant galaxy at redshift $z=14.32$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a model for the star formation history (SFH) of super-early galaxies and applied it to GS-z14-0, the most distant galaxy known, located at $z=14.32$ (294 million years after the Big Bang). The SFH, starting at $z=26.7$, is complex. Initially ($z&gt;18$), the galaxy experiences feedback-regulated phases that are bursty, relatively faint (reaching $M_{\rm UV}=-18.4$), and unattenuated. When dust shielding allows for a smooth star formation rate (SFR), the galaxy quickly becomes heavily obscured. During this obscured phase, which lasts for approximately 20% of the total star-forming time, 70% of the observed stars are formed. Super-early galaxies in this phase should be detectable by ALMA. Twenty-six million years before observation, as the galaxy becomes super-Eddington, a powerful radiation-driven outflow clears most of the dust and significantly reduces the SFR by a factor of seven, from $100 \to 15\ M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$. The galaxy transitions into a "blue monster" dominating the bright end of the UV luminosity function. When the outflow ceases due to decreased dust opacity, the galaxy relaxes into a post-starburst phase, in which it is currently observed. Our model accurately reproduces all the observed and inferred properties of the galaxy. The analysis of this extreme system opens exciting opportunities for studying the beginnings of the luminous Universe.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XIII: Strong-lens candidates at all mass scales and their environments from the Hyper-Suprime Cam and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed a systematic search for galaxy-scale strong lenses using Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data, focusing on lenses in overdense environments. To identify these lens candidates, we exploit our neural network from HOLISMOKES VI, which is trained on realistic gri mock-images as positive examples, and real images as negative examples. Compared to our previous work, we lower the i-Kron radius limit to &gt;0.5". This results in an increase by around 73 million sources to more than 135 million images. During our visual multi-stage grading of the network candidates, we now inspect simultaneously larger stamps (80"x80") to identify large, extended arcs cropped in the 10"x10" cutouts, and classify additionally their overall environment. Here we also reinspect our previous lens candidates and classify their environment. Using these 546 visually identified lens candidates, we further define various criteria by exploiting extensive and complementary photometric redshift catalogs, to select the candidates in overdensities. In total, we identified 24 grade-A and 138 grade-B candidates with either spatially-resolved multiple images or extended, distorted arcs in the new sample. Furthermore, with our different techniques, we identify in total 237/546 lens candidates in a cluster-like or overdense environment, containing only 49 group- or cluster-scale re-discoveries. These results demonstrate the feasibility of downloading and applying network classifiers to hundreds of million cutouts, necessary in the upcoming era of big data from deep, wide-field imaging surveys like Euclid and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, while leading to a sample size that can be inspected by humans. These networks, with false-positive rates of ~0.01%, are very powerful tools to identify such rare galaxy-scale strong lensing systems, while also aiding in the discovery of new strong lensing clusters.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: galaxy stellar population properties estimate with narrow-band data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrowband galaxy surveys have recently gained interest as a promising method to achieve the necessary accuracy on the photometric redshift estimate of individual galaxies for stage-IV cosmological surveys. One key advantage is the ability to provide higher spectral resolution information about galaxies that should allow a more accurate and precise estimation of galaxy stellar population properties. However, the impact of adding narrow-band photometry on the stellar population properties estimate is largely unexplored. The scope of this work is two-fold: on one side, leveraging the predictive power of broad-band and narrow-band data to infer galaxy physical properties such as stellar masses, ages, star formation rates and metallicities. On the other hand, evaluating the improvement of performance in estimating galaxy properties when we use narrow-band data instead of broad-band. In this work we measure the stellar population properties of a sample of galaxies in the COSMOS field for which both narrowband and broadband data are available. In particular, we employ narrowband data from PAUS and broad-band data from CFHTLS. We use two different spectral energy distribution fitting codes to measure galaxy properties, namely CIGALE and Prospector. We find that the increased spectral resolution of narrow-band photometry does not yield a substantial improvement on constraining galaxy properties using spectral energy distribution fitting. Still we find that we obtain a more diverse distribution of metallicities and dust optical depths with cigale when employing the narrowband data. The effect is not as prominent as expected, which we relate this to the low narrowband SNR of a majority of the galaxies, the respective drawbacks of both codes as well as the coverage only in the optical regime. The measured properties are afterwards compared to the COSMOS2020 catalogue, showing good agreement.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Mass and Eddington Ratio Distribution of Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a rare population of hyper-luminous infrared galaxies discovered by the WISE mission. Despite the significant obscuration of the AGN by dust in these systems, pronounced broad and blue-shifted emission lines are often observed. Previous work has shown that 8 Hot DOGs, referred to as Blue-excess Hot DOGs (BHDs), present a blue excess consistent with type 1 quasar emission in their UV-optical SEDs, which has been shown to originate from the light of the obscured central engine scattered into the line of sight. We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical emission characteristics for 172 Hot DOGs through UV-MIR SED modeling and spectroscopic details, with a particular focus on the identification of BHDs. We find that while the optical emission observed in Hot DOGs is in most cases dominated by a young stellar population, 26% of Hot DOGs show a significant enough blue excess emission to be classified as BHDs. Based on their broad CIV and MgII lines, we find that the $M_{\rm BH}$ in BHDs range from $10^{8.7}$ to $10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$. When using the same emission lines in regular Hot DOGs, we find the $M_{\rm BH}$ estimates cover the entire range found for BHDs while also extending to somewhat lower values. This agreement may imply that the broad lines in regular Hot DOGs also originate from scattered light from the central engine, just as in BHDs, although a more detailed study would be needed to rule out an outflow-driven nature. Similar to $z\sim 6$ quasars, we find that Hot DOGs sit above the local relation between stellar and black hole mass, suggesting either that AGN feedback has not yet significantly suppressed the stellar mass growth in the host galaxies, or that they will be outliers of the relation when reaching $z$=0.</description>

      <title>Predicting gravitational wave signals from BPASS White Dwarf Binary and Black Hole Binary populations of a Milky Way-like galaxy model for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic white dwarf binaries (WDBs) and black hole binaries (BHBs) will be gravitational wave (GW) sources for LISA. Their detection will provide insights into binary evolution and the evolution of our Galaxy through cosmic history. Here, we make predictions of the expected WDB and BHB population within our Galaxy. We combine predictions of the compact remnant binary populations expected by stellar evolution by using the detailed Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS) with a Milky Way analogue galaxy model from the Feedback In Realistic Environment (FIRE) simulations. We use \textsc{PhenomA} and \textsc{LEGWORK} to simulate LISA observations. Both packages make similar predictions that on average four Galactic BHBs and 673 Galactic WDBs above the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of 7 after a four-year mission. We compare these predictions to earlier results using the Binary Star Evolution (BSE) code with the same FIRE model galaxy. We find that BPASS predicts a few more LISA observable Galactic BHBs and a twentieth of the Galactic WDBs. The differences are due to the different physical assumptions that have gone into the binary evolution calculations. These results indicate that the expected population of compact binaries that LISA will detect depends very sensitively on the binary population synthesis models used and thus observations of the LISA population will provide tight constraints on our modelling of binary stars. Finally, from our synthetic populations we have created mock LISA signals that can be used to test and refine data processing methods of the eventual LISA observations.</description>

      <title>SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES). V. Confusion-limited Submillimeter Galaxy Number Counts at 450 $\mu$m and Data Release for the COSMOS Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present confusion-limited SCUBA-2 450-$\mu$m observations in the COSMOS-CANDELS region as part of the JCMT Large Program, SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES). Our maps at 450 and 850 $\mu$m cover an area of 450 arcmin$^2$. We achieved instrumental noise levels of $\sigma_{\mathrm{450}}=$ 0.59 mJy beam$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{850}}=$ 0.09 mJy beam$^{-1}$ in the deepest area of each map. The corresponding confusion noise levels are estimated to be 0.65 and 0.36 mJy beam$^{-1}$. Above the 4 (3.5) $\sigma$ threshold, we detected 360 (479) sources at 450 $\mu$m and 237 (314) sources at 850 $\mu$m. We derive the deepest blank-field number counts at 450 $\mu$m, covering the flux-density range of 2 to 43 mJy. These are in agreement with other SCUBA-2 blank-field and lensing-cluster observations, but are lower than various model counts. We compare the counts with those in other fields and find that the field-to-field variance observed at 450 $\mu$m at the $R=6^\prime$ scale is consistent with Poisson noise, so there is no evidence of strong 2-D clustering at this scale. Additionally, we derive the integrated surface brightness at 450 $\mu$m down to 2.1 mJy to be $57.3^{+1.0}_{-6.2}$~Jy deg$^{-2}$, contributing to (41$\pm$4)\% of the 450-$\mu$m extragalactic background light (EBL) measured by COBE and Planck. Our results suggest that the 450-$\mu$m EBL may be fully resolved at $0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$~mJy, which extremely deep lensing-cluster observations and next-generation submillimeter instruments with large aperture sizes may be able to achieve.</description>

      <title>The SAMI Galaxy Survey: impact of star formation and AGN feedback processes on the ionized gas velocity dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of star formation and instantaneous AGN feedback processes on the ionized gas velocity dispersion in a sample of 1285 emission-line galaxies with stellar masses $\log\,(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9$ from the integral-field spectroscopy SAMI Galaxy Survey. We fit both narrow and broad emission line components using aperture spectra integrated within one effective radius, while ensuring the elimination of velocity differences between the spectra of individual spaxels. Our analysis reveals that 386 (30%) galaxies can be adequately described using a single emission component while 356 (28%) galaxies require two (broad and narrow) components. Galaxies characterized by high mass, elevated star formation rate surface density, or type-2 AGN-like emissions tend to feature an additional broad emission-line component, leading to their classification as double-component galaxies. We explore the correlations between $M_*$ and gas velocity dispersions, highlighting that the prominence of the broad component significantly contributes to elevating the gas velocity dispersion. Galaxies displaying AGN-like emission based on optical definitions show enhanced gas velocity dispersions. In star-forming galaxies, both stellar mass and star-formation rate surface density substantially contribute to the velocity dispersion of the narrow component. Increased star-forming activity appears to elevate the velocity dispersion of the narrow component. The broad component exhibits a weaker dependence on stellar mass and is primarily driven by galactic outflows. We suggest that strong star forming activity leads to the formation of a broad emission-line component, but the impact on inflating gas velocity dispersion is moderate. On the other hand, AGN-driven outflows appear to be a more important contributor to the elevated velocity dispersion of the ionized gas.</description>

      <title>Star formation activity of low-mass galaxies at the peak epoch of galaxy formation probed by deep narrow-band imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass galaxies at high redshifts are the building blocks of more massive galaxies at later times and are thus key populations for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. We have made deep narrow-band observations for two protoclusters and the general field in COSMOS at $z$ $\sim$ 2. In a clumpy young protocluster, USS1558$-$003, at $z$ = 2.53, we find many star-forming galaxies well above the star-forming main sequence of field galaxies at the low-mass end ($M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}&lt;10^{8.9}$). This suggests that some environmental effects may be at work in low-mass galaxies in high-density regions to enhance their star formation activities. In the core of this protocluster, we also find that enhanced star formation activity of middle-mass galaxies ($10^{8.9} &lt; M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}} &lt; 10^{10.2}$) while such trends are not observed in a more mature protocluster, PKS1138$-$262 at $z$ = 2.16. We expect these activities to be mainly due to galaxy mergers/interactions and differences in the amount of cold gas accretion. As one piece of evidence, we show that the star formation activity within individual galaxies in the protoclusters is more centrally concentrated than those in the field. This is probably due to the enhanced interactions between galaxies in the protocluster, which can reduce the angular momentum of the gas, drive the gas towards the galaxy center, and lead to a central starburst.</description>

      <title>Enhanced formation of interstellar complex organic molecules on carbon monoxide ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of carbon monoxide ice in the chemical evolution of prestellar cores using astrochemical rate equation models. We constrain the ratios of the binding energies on CO ice and H$_{2}$O ice for a series of adsorbates deemed important in diffusive chemistry on H$_{2}$O ices. We later include these ratios in our chemical reaction network model, where the binding and diffusion energies of icy species vary as a function of the surface composition. When the surface coverage of CO increases, the model shows an enhancement of O-bearing complex organic molecules, especially those formed from the intermediate products of CO hydrogenation (e.g. HCO) and CH$_{3}$/CH$_{2}$. Because the binding energy of CH$_{3}$/CH$_{2}$ is in the right range, its diffusion rate increases significantly with CO coverage. At $T&gt;$14 K and with less influence, enhanced diffusion of HCO also contributes to the increase of the abundances of COM. We find, however, that chemistry is not always enhanced on CO ice and that the temperature and cosmic ray ionization rate of each astronomical object is crucial for this particular chemistry, revealing a highly non-trivial behavior that needs to be addressed on a per-case basis. Our results are highly relevant in the context of interstellar ice observations with JWST.</description>

      <title>Star formation across cosmic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium of galaxies is composed of multiple phases, including molecular, atomic, and ionized gas, as well as dust. Stars are formed within this medium from cold molecular gas clouds, which collapse due to their gravitational attraction. Throughout their life, stars emit strong radiation fields and stellar winds, and they can also explode as supernovae at the end of their life. These processes contribute to stirring the turbulent interstellar medium and regulate star formation by heating up, ionizing, and expelling part of the gas. However, star formation does not proceed uniformly throughout the history of the Universe and decrease by an order of magnitude in the last ten billion years. To understand this winding-down of star formation and assess possible variations in the efficiency of star formation, it is crucial to probe the molecular gas reservoirs from which stars are formed. In this article following my presentation at the 10th International Conference on Frontiers of Plasma Physics and Technology held in Kathmandu from 13-17 March 2023, I review some aspects of the multiphase interstellar medium and star formation, with an emphasis on the interplay between neutral and ionized phases, and present recent and ongoing observations of the molecular gas content in typical star-forming galaxies across cosmic time and in different environments. I also present some of our understanding of star-forming galaxies from theoretical models and simulations.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Rest-Frame UV Colors at z ~ 2-4 with HST UVCANDELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of rest-frame UV colors of 17,243 galaxies at $z\sim2-4$ in the HST UVCANDELS fields: GOODS-N, GOODS-S, COSMOS, and EGS. Here, we study the rest-frame UV spectral slope, $\beta$, measured via model spectra obtained via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, $\beta_{SED}$, and explore its correlation with various galaxy parameters (photometric redshift, UV magnitude, stellar mass, dust attenuation, star formation rate [SFR], and specific SFR) obtained via SED fitting with Dense Basis. We also obtain measurements for $\beta$ via photometric power-law fitting and compare them to our SED-fit-based results, finding good agreement on average. While we find little evolution in $\beta$ with redshift from $z=2-4$ for the full population, there are clear correlations between $\beta$ (and related parameters) when binned by stellar mass. For this sample, lower stellar mass galaxies (log[$M_*$] = 7.5-8.5 $M_\odot$) are typically bluer ($\beta_{SED}=-2.0\pm 0.2$ / $\beta_{PL} = -2.1\pm0.4$), fainter ($MUV = -17.8^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$) less dusty ($A{v}=0.4\pm0.1$ mag), exhibit lower rates of star formation (log[SFR]=$0.1\pm0.2 M_\odot/$ yr) and higher specific star formation rates (log[sSFR]=$-8.2\pm0.2 \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) than their high-mass counterparts. Higher-mass galaxies (log[$M_*$] $=10.0-12.0 \ M_\odot$) are on average redder ($\beta_{SED}=-0.9^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ / $\beta_{PL}=-1.0^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$), brighter ($MUV=-19.6^{+1.0}_{-1.2}$), dustier ($Av = 0.9^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ mag), have higher SFRs (log[SFR]=$1.2^{+0.6}_{-1.1} M_\odot$ yr), and lower sSFRs (log[sSFR]=$-9.1^{+0.5}_{-1.1} {yr}^{-1}$). This study's substantial sample size provides a benchmark for demonstrating that the rest-frame UV spectral slope correlates with stellar mass-dependent galaxy characteristics at $z\sim2-4$, a relationship less discernible with smaller datasets typically available at higher redshifts.</description>

Abstract: With stunning clarity, JWST has revealed the Universe's first billion years. The scientific community is analyzing a wealth of JWST imaging and spectroscopic data from that era, and is in the process of rewriting the astronomy textbooks. Here, 1.5 years into the JWST science mission, we provide a snapshot of the great progress made towards understanding the initial chapters of our cosmic history. We highlight discoveries and breakthroughs, topics and issues that are not yet understood, and questions that will be addressed in the coming years, as JWST continues its revolutionary observations of the Early Universe. While this compendium is written by a small number of authors, invited to ISSI Bern in March 2024 as part of the 2024 ISSI Breakthrough Workshop, we acknowledge the work of a large community that is advancing our collective understanding of the evolution of the Early Universe.</description>

      <title>The Velocity Dispersion Function for Quiescent Galaxies in Massive Clusters from IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the central stellar velocity dispersion function for quiescent galaxies in 280 massive clusters with $\log (M_{200} / M_{\odot}) &gt; 14$ in IllustrisTNG300. The velocity dispersion function is an independent tracer of the dark matter mass distribution of subhalos in galaxy clusters. Based on the IllustrisTNG cluster catalog, we select quiescent member subhalos with a specific star formation rate $&lt; 2 \times 10^{-11}$ yr${^-1}$ and stellar mass $\log (M_{*} / M_{\odot}) &gt; 9$. We then simulate fiber spectroscopy to measure the stellar velocity dispersion of the simulated galaxies; we compute the line-of-sight velocity dispersions of star particles within a cylindrical volume that penetrates the core of each subhalo. We construct the velocity dispersion functions for quiescent subhalos within $R_{200}$. The simulated cluster velocity dispersion function exceeds the simulated field velocity dispersion function for $\log \sigma_{*} &gt; 2.2$, indicating the preferential formation of large velocity dispersion galaxies in dense environments. The excess is similar in simulations and in the observations. We also compare the simulated velocity dispersion function for the three most massive clusters with $\log (M_{200} / M_{\odot}) &gt; 15$ with the observed velocity dispersion function for the two most massive clusters in the local universe, Coma and A2029. Intriguingly, the simulated velocity dispersion functions are significantly lower for $\log \sigma_{*} &gt; 2.0$. This discrepancy results from 1) a smaller number of subhalos with $\log (M_{*} / M_{\odot}) &gt; 10$ in TNG300 compared to the observed clusters, and 2) a significant offset between the observed and simulated $M_{*} - \sigma_{*}$ relations. The velocity dispersion function offers a unique window on galaxy and structure formation in simulations.</description>

      <title>On the contributions of extragalactic CO emission lines to ground-based CMB observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of CO rotational lines at redshifts $z\sim 0-6$ being an appreciable source of extragalactic foreground anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. Motivated by previous investigations, we specifically focus on the frequency bands and small scales probed by ground-based surveys. Using an empirical parameterization for the relation between the infrared luminosity of galaxies and their CO line luminosity, conditioned on sub-mm observations of CO luminosity functions from $J=1$ to $J=7$ at $\nu = \{100,250\}$ GHz, we explore how uncertainty in the CO luminosity function translates into uncertainty in the signature of CO emission in the CMB. We find that at $\ell = 3000$ the amplitude of both CO autocorrelation and cross-correlation with the CIB could be detectable in an ACT-like experiment with 90, 150 and 220 GHz bands, even in the scenarios with the lowest amplitude consistent with sub-mm data. We also investigate, for the first time, the amplitude of the CO$\times$CIB correlation between different frequency bands and find that our model predicts that this signal could be comparable to the amplitude of the cosmic infrared background frequency cross-correlation at certain wavelengths. This implies current observations can potentially be used to constrain the bright end of CO luminosity functions, which are difficult to probe with current sub-mm telescopes due to the small volumes they survey. Our findings corroborate past results and have significant implications in template-based searches for CMB secondaries, such as the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect, using the frequency-dependent high-$\ell$ TT power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Folk wisdom dictates that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <title>The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE): Mission Design and Science Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) is an Explorer-class mission concept to measure the energy spectrum and linear polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). A single cryogenic Fourier transform spectrometer compares the sky to an external blackbody calibration target, measuring the Stokes I, Q, U parameters to levels ~200 Jy/sr in each 2.65 degree diameter beam over the full sky, in each of 300 frequency channels from 28 GHz to 6 THz. With sensitivity over 1000 times greater than COBE/FIRAS, PIXIE opens a broad discovery space for the origin, contents, and evolution of the universe. Measurements of small distortions from a CMB blackbody spectrum provide a robust determination of the mean electron pressure and temperature in the universe while constraining processes including dissipation of primordial density perturbations, black holes, and the decay or annihilation of dark matter. Full-sky maps of linear polarization measure the optical depth to reionization at nearly the cosmic variance limit and constrain models of primordial inflation. Spectra with sub-percent absolute calibration spanning microwave to far-IR wavelengths provide a legacy data set for analyses including line intensity mapping of extragalactic emission and the cosmic infrared background amplitude and anisotropy. We describe the PIXIE instrument sensitivity, foreground subtraction, and anticipated science return from both the baseline 2-year mission and a potential extended mission.</description>

      <title>Simulating the arrival of the southern substructure in the galaxy cluster Abell 1758</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abell 1758 (z~0.278) is a galaxy cluster composed of two structures: A1758N and A1758S, separated by ~2.2 Mpc. The northern cluster is itself a dissociative merging cluster that has already been modelled by dedicated simulations. Recent radio observations revealed the existence of a previously undetected bridge connecting A1758N and A1758S. New simulations are now needed to take into account the presence of A1758S. We wish to evaluate which orbital configuration would be compatible with a bridge between the clusters. Using N-body hydrodynamical simulations that build upon the previous model, we explore different scenarios that could have led to the current observed configuration. Five types of orbital approaches were tested: radial, tangential, vertical, post-apocentric, and outgoing. We found that the incoming simulated scenarios are generally consistent with mild enhancements of gas density between the approaching clusters. The mock X-ray images exhibit a detectable bridge in all cases. Compared to measurements of Chandra data, the amplitude of the X-ray excess is overestimated by a factor of ~2--3 in the best simulations. The scenario of tangential approach proved to be the one that best matches the properties of the profiles of X-ray surface brightness. The scenarios of radial approach of vertical approach are also marginally compatible.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the asphericities in the explosion and multi-faceted circumstellar matter of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric observations of the Type II SN 2023ixf. The early detection of highly-ionized flash features, rapid ascent in ultraviolet flux coupled with the blueward shift in near-ultraviolet colors and temperature provides compelling evidence for a delayed shock breakout from a confined dense circumstellar matter (CSM) enveloping the progenitor star. The temporal evolution of polarization in the SN 2023ixf phase revealed three distinct peaks in polarization evolution at 1.4 d, 6.4 d, and 79.2 d, indicating an asymmetric dense CSM, an aspherical shock front and clumpiness in the low-density extended CSM, and an aspherical inner ejecta/He-core. SN 2023ixf displayed two dominant axes, one along the CSM-outer ejecta and the other along the inner ejecta/He-core, showcasing the independent origin of asymmetry in the early and late evolution. The argument for an aspherical shock front is further strengthened by the presence of a high-velocity broad absorption feature in the blue wing of the Balmer features in addition to the P-Cygni absorption post 16 d. Hydrodynamical light curve modeling indicated a progenitor mass of 10 solar mass with a radius of 470 solar radius, explosion energy of 2e51 erg, and 0.06 solar mass of 56Ni. The modeling also indicated a two-zone CSM: a confined dense CSM extending up to 5e14 cm, with a mass-loss rate of 1e-2 solar mass per year, and an extended CSM spanning from 5e14 cm to 1e16 cm with a mass-loss rate of 1e-4 solar mass per year. The early nebular phase observations display an axisymmetric line profile of [OI] and red-ward attenuation of the emission of Halpha post 125 days, marking the onset of dust formation.</description>

Abstract: We describe the NIRSpec component of the JWST Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), and provide deep spectroscopy of 253 sources targeted with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and surrounding GOODS-South. The multi-object spectra presented here are the deepest so far obtained with JWST, amounting to up to 28 hours in the low-dispersion ($R\sim 30-300$) prism, and up to 7 hours in each of the three medium-resolution $R\approx 1000$ gratings and one high-dispersion grating, G395H ($R\approx2700$). Our low-dispersion and medium-dispersion spectra cover the wavelength range $0.6-5.3\mu$m. We describe the selection of the spectroscopic targets, the strategy for the allocation of targets to micro-shutters, and the design of the observations. We present the public release of the reduced 2D and 1D spectra, and a description of the reduction and calibration process. We measure spectroscopic redshifts for 178 of the objects targeted extending up to $z=13.2$. We present a catalog of all emission lines detected at $S/N&gt;5$, and our redshift determinations for the targets. Combined with the first JADES NIRCam data release, these public JADES spectroscopic and imaging datasets provide a new foundation for discoveries of the infrared universe by the worldwide scientific community.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the Variety of Velocity Dispersion Profiles of Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observed and simulated galaxies exhibit a significant variation in their velocity dispersion profiles. We examine the inner and outer slopes of stellar velocity dispersion profiles using integral field spectroscopy data from two surveys, SAMI (for $z &lt; 0.115$) and CALIFA (for $z &lt; 0.03$), comparing them with results from two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations: Horizon-AGN (for $z = 0.017$) and NewHorizon (for $z\lesssim1$). The simulated galaxies closely reproduce the variety of velocity dispersion slopes and stellar mass dependence of both inner and outer radii ($0.5\,r_{50}$ and $3\,r_{50}$) as observed, where $r_{50}$ stands for half-light radius. The inner slopes are mainly influenced by the relative radial distribution of the young and old stars formed in-situ: a younger center shows a flatter inner profile. The presence of accreted (ex-situ) stars has two effects on the velocity dispersion profiles. First, because they are more dispersed in spatial and velocity distributions compared to in-situ formed stars, it increases the outer slope of the velocity dispersion profile. It also causes the velocity anisotropy to be more radial. More massive galaxies have a higher fraction of stars formed ex-situ and hence show a higher slope in outer velocity dispersion profile and a higher degree of radial anisotropy. The diversity in the outer velocity dispersion profiles reflects the diverse assembly histories among galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14509v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sample of SiO-masing late-type stars located in the inner Galaxy is analyzed with the goal of better constraining their obscuration. This reference sample allows us to define mathematical relations between their dereddened infrared colours and the observed colours (e.g. \Ks-[8], \Ks-[24]). The derived equations define a property (a locus) of these late-type stars. Therefore, they enable us to derive the interstellar extinction. With estimated spectral types, it is possible to decompose the total extinction in the two components (interstellar and envelope extinction). These relations are very useful to classify extremely obscured late-type stars located in the inner Galaxy. Estimating the two extinction components is performable on an individual late-type star, independently of its surrounding, and also when a few mid-infrared measurements are available.</description>

      <title>A mock redshift catalogue of the dusty star-forming galaxy population with intrinsic clustering and lensing for deep millimetre surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new cosmologically motivated mock redshift survey of the Dusty Star-Forming Galaxy population. Our mock survey is based on the Bolshoi-Planck dark-matter halo simulation and covers an area of 5.3 sq. degree. Using a semi-empirical approach, we generate a light cone and populate the dark-matter haloes with galaxies. Infrared properties are assigned to the galaxies based on theoretical and empirical relations from the literature. Additionally, background galaxies are gravitationally lensed by dark-matter haloes along the line-of-sight assuming a point-mass model approximation. We characterize the mock survey by measuring the star formation rate density, integrated number counts, redshift distribution, and infrared luminosity function. When compared with single-dish and interferometric observations, the predictions from our mock survey closely follow the compiled results from the literature. We have also directed this study towards characterizing one of the extragalactic legacy surveys to be observed with the TolTEC camera at the Large Millimeter Telescope: the 0.8 sq. degree Ultra Deep Survey, with expected depths of 0.025, 0.018 and 0.012 mJy beam$^{-1}$ at 1.1, 1.4 and 2.0 mm. Exploiting the clustering information in our mock survey, we investigate its impact on the effect of flux boosting by the fainter population of dusty galaxies, finding that clustering can increase the median boosting by 0.5 per cent at 1.1 mm, 0.8 per cent at 1.4 mm and, 2.0 per cent at 2.0 mm, and with higher dispersion.</description>

      <title>Model-independent Reconstruction of UV Luminosity Function and Reionization Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a first comprehensive study of the Luminosity Function (LF) using a non-parametric approach. We use Gaussian Process to fit available luminosity data between redshifts $z \sim 2-8$. Our free-form LF in the non-parametric approach rules out the conventional Schechter function model to describe the abundance-magnitude relation at redshifts $z=3$ and $4$. Hints of deviation from the Schechter function are also noticed at redshifts 2, 7 and 8 at lower statistical significance. Significant deviation starts for brighter ionizing sources at $M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21$. The UV luminosity density data at different redshifts are then derived by integrating the LFs obtained from both methods with a truncation magnitude of $-17$. In our analysis, we also include the first 90 arcmin$^2$ JWST/NIRCam data at $z \sim 9-12$. Since at larger magnitudes, we do not find major deviations from the Schechter function, the integrated luminosity density differs marginally between the two methods. Finally, we obtain the history of reionization from a joint analysis of UV luminosity density data along with the ionization fraction data and Planck observation of Cosmic Microwave Background. The history of reionization is not affected by the deviation of LFs from Schechter function at lower magnitudes. We derive reionization optical depth to be $\tau_{\rm re}=0.0494^{+0.0007}_{-0.0006}$ and the duration between 10$\%$ and 90$\% $completion of ionization process is found to be $\Delta z\sim 1.627^{+0.059}_{-0.071}$.</description>

Exploiting high spatial resolution ($\approx20$ pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array $^{12}$CO(1-0) observations, we study the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the nuclear ring and its vicinity, identifying $158$ spatially- and spectrally-resolved GMCs. The GMC sizes ($R_{\mathrm{c}}$) are comparable to those of the clouds in the Milky Way (MW) disc, but their gas masses, observed linewidths ($\sigma_{\mathrm{obs,los}}$) and gas mass surface densities are larger. The GMC size -- linewidth relation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{obs,los}}\propto R_{\mathrm{c}}^{0.77}$) is steeper than that of the clouds of the MW disc and centre, and the GMCs are on average only marginally gravitationally bound (with a mean virial parameter $\langle\alpha_{\mathrm{obs,vir}}\rangle\approx1.7$). We discuss the possible origins of the steep size -- linewidth relation and enhanced observed linewidths of the clouds and suggest that a combination of mechanisms such as stellar feedback, gas accretion and cloud-cloud collisions, as well as the gas inflows driven by the large-scale bar, may play a role.</description>

Abstract: Bright blazars were found to be prominent neutrino sources, and a number of IceCube events were associated with them. Evaluating high-energy photon emission of such blazars is crucial for better understanding of the processes and regions where neutrinos are produced. Here, we focus on hard X-ray emission observed by the SRG/ART-XC telescope, by the Swift/BAT imager, and by the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope. Their energy range ~10 keV is well-suited for probing photons that potentially participate in neutrino production by interacting with ultrarelativistic protons. We find that neutrino-associated blazars tend to demonstrate remarkably strong X-ray emission compared to other VLBI blazars in the sky. Both neutrinos and hard X-rays are found to come from blazars at cosmological distances z ~ 1, and are boosted by relativistic beaming that makes it possible to detect them on Earth. Our results suggest that neutrinos are produced within compact blazar jets, with target X-ray photons emitted from accelerated jet regions.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Disentangling for Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19391</link>

Abstract: A suite of spectroscopic surveys is producing vast sets of stellar spectra with the goal of advancing stellar physics and Galactic evolution by determining their basic physical properties. A substantial fraction of these stars are in binary systems, but almost all large-survey modeling pipelines treat them as single stars. For sets of multi-epoch spectra, spectral disentangling is a powerful technique to recover or constrain the individual components' spectra of a multiple system. So far, this approach has focused on small samples or individual objects, usually with high resolution ($R \gtrsim 10.000$) spectra and many epochs ($\gtrsim 8$). Here, we present a disentangling implementation that accounts for several aspects of few-epoch spectra from large surveys: that vast sample sizes require automatic determination of starting guesses; that some of the most extensive spectroscopic surveys have a resolution of only $\approx 2,000$; that few epochs preclude unique orbit fitting; that one needs effective regularisation of the disentangled solution to ensure resulting spectra are smooth. We describe the implementation of this code and show with simulated spectra how well spectral recovery can work for hot and cool stars at $R \approx 2000$. Moreover, we verify the code on two established binary systems, the ``Unicorn'' and ``Giraffe''. This code can serve to explore new regimes in survey disentangling in search of massive stars with massive dark companions, e.g. the $\gtrsim 200,000$ hot stars of the SDSS-V survey.</description>
