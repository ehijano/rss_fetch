      <title>Improving parent-austenite twinned grain reconstruction using electron backscatter diffraction in low carbon austenite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermomechanical controlled processing (TMCP) is widely used to optimize the final properties of high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels, via microstructure engineering. The room temperature microstructures are influenced by the high temperature austenite phase, and the austenite microstructure is commonly accessed by reconstruction using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data of the final microstructure. A challenge for reconstruction of the PAG microstructure and subsequent austenite grain size measurement is the presence of austenite-phase annealing twins, and we address challenge with a new 're-sort' algorithm. Our algorithm has been validated using the retained austenite regions (which were recovered via advanced pattern matching of EBSD patterns). We demonstrate that the re-sort algorithm improves the PAG reconstruction significantly, especially for the grain boundary network and correlation with other methods of grain size assessment and development of TMCP steels.</description>

      <title>Auto-resolving atomic structure at van der Waal interfaces using a generative model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling atomic structures is significant for the relationship construction between microscopic configurations and macroscopic properties of materials. However, we still lack a rapid, accurate, and robust approach to automatically resolve complex patterns in atomic-resolution microscopy. Here, we present a Trident strategy-enhanced disentangled representation learning method (a generative model), which utilizes a few unlabeled experimental images with abundant low-cost simulated images to generate a large corpus of annotated simulation data that closely resembles experimental conditions, realizing simultaneous achievement of high quality and large volumes of the training dataset. A structural inference model is then trained via a residual neural network which can directly deduce the interlayer slip and rotation of diversified and complicated stacking patterns at van der Waals (vdWs) interfaces with picometer-scale accuracy across various materials (ReS2, ReSe2, and MoS2) with different layer numbers (bilayer and trilayers) and demonstrates robustness to defects, imaging quality, and surface contaminations. The framework can also identify pattern transition interfaces, quantify subtle motif variations, and discriminate moir\'e patterns that are undistinguishable in frequency domains. The high-throughput processing ability of our method helps discover a novel vdW epitaxy where various thermodynamically favorable slip stackings can coexist, demonstrating the machine learning contribution to the new knowledge emergence.</description>

      <title>The Role of Allotropy on Phase Formation in High Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying single phase, high-entropy systems has been a prominent research focus of materials engineering over the past decade. The considerable effort in computational modeling and experimental verification has yielded several methods and descriptors for predicting if a single phase will form; however, the details surrounding the resulting crystal structure have largely remained a mystery. Here, we present a compelling argument for the role of allotropy in determining the crystal structure of a single-phase, high-entropy alloy. High entropy alloys can contain 5 or more elements and must achieve a configurational entropy greater than 1.5R. This study shows that when these high entropy material conditions are met, the majority crystal structure of the non-allotrope forming element plays a dominant role in crystal structure determination. The theory is demonstrated via several approaches, including analysis of 434 unique known single-phase compositions from the literature, thermodynamic modeling of more than 1,400 compositions, and experimental synthesis of nine specific alloys that test this hypothesis. The results demonstrate allotropy can identify a subset of compositions unlikely to form a single phase and predict the crystal structure with a high degree of accuracy for a wide range of simple (e.g., 5 equiatomic elements) and more complex (e.g., Al0.3B0.6CoCrFeNiCu0.7Si0.1) high entropy alloys. Allotropy provides new insight into the underlying physics governing the resultant crystal structure in materials without a principle element. As high entropy materials continue to be an area of focus for developing materials with unique properties, this study is expected to serve as a significant tool in the screening of materials for specific crystal structures.</description>

      <title>New magnetic topological materials from high-throughput search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a high-throughput search for topological magnetic materials on 522 new, experimentally reported commensurate magnetic structures from MAGNDATA, doubling the number of available materials on the Topological Magnetic Materials database. This brings up to date the previous studies which had become incomplete due to the discovery of new materials. For each material, we performed first-principle electronic calculations and diagnosed the topology as a function of the Hubbard U parameter. Our high-throughput calculation led us to the prediction of 250 experimentally relevant topologically non-trivial materials, which represent 47.89% of the newly analyzed materials. We present five remarkable examples of these materials, each showcasing a different topological phase: Mn${}_2$AlB${}_2$ (BCSID 1.508), which exhibits a nodal line semimetal to topological insulator transition as a function of SOC, CaMnSi (BCSID 0.599), a narrow gap axion insulator, UAsS (BCSID 0.594) a 5f-orbital Weyl semimetal, CsMnF${}_4$ (BCSID 0.327), a material presenting a new type of quasi-symmetry protected closed nodal surface and FeCr${}_2$S${}_4$ (BCSID 0.613), a symmetry-enforced semimetal with double Weyls and spin-polarised surface states.</description>

      <title>Microstructural characterization to reveal evidence of shock deformation in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of meteorites and their microstructures is a topic which spans multiple fields of research, such as meteoritics and materials science. For materials scientists and engineers, the extreme and unusual conditions which these microstructures form allow for insight into materials which would exist at the edge of our thermomechanical processing abilities. One such microstructure found in low-shock event iron meteorites is Neumann bands. These bands are an array of lenticular deformation twins that form throughout the Fe-Ni matrix with numerous intersections, resulting in many high stress and strain regions within the material's surface. The existence of these regions and the shocks that formed them encourage atypical strain accommodating mechanisms and structural changes of the material. However, direct investigation of the deformation twin intersections and the microstructural behaviour in and around these regions has been limited. In this work, investigation of these regions in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment, with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and forescatter electron (FSE) imaging, revealed two primary findings: high-intensity pattern doubling mirrored across the {110} band at twin-twin intersection and microband formation across the sample surface, which suggest multilayer twinning and constraint of the crystal structure at points of twin-twin intersection. Microbands were found to form along the {110} plane and in regions near Neumann bands. The simultaneous existence of Neumann bands (microtwins) and microbands is presented here for a BCC material, and it is believed the Neumann band and microbands formed during different types and/or shock events. The presence of both Neumann bands and microbands within a BCC iron meteorite is previously unreported and may be valuable in furthering our understanding of shock deformation within iron-based materials.</description>

      <title>Molecular interaction volume model of mixing enthalpy for molten salt system: An integrated calorimetry-model case study of LaCl$_3$-(LiCl-KCl)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calorimetric determination of enthalpies of mixing ($\Delta$H$_{\rm mix}$) of multicomponent molten salts often employs empirical models that lack parameters with clear physical interpretation (e.g., coordination numbers, molar volumes, and pair potentials). Although such physics informed models are not always needed, a thermodynamic understanding of the relationships between excess energies of mixing and local to intermediate solvation structures is particularly important for pyrochemical separation, as is the case for lanthanides (Ln), which are common neutron poisons and critical industrial elements found in spent nuclear fuels. Here we implement the molecular interaction volume model (MIVM) to synthesize information from experimentally measured $\Delta$H$_{\rm mix}$ (using high temperature melt drop calorimetry) and the distribution of solvation structures from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. This was demonstrated by a case study of molten salt system consisted of LaCl$_3$ mixing with a eutectic LiCl-KCl (58mol% to 42mol%) at 873 K and 1133 K. The parameters modelled from MIVM were used to extrapolate excess Gibbs energy ($\Delta$G$_{\rm mix}$), and compositional dependence of La$^{3+}$ activity in the LaCl$_3$-(LiCl-KCl) system. In contrast, by AIMD or polarizable ion model (PIM) simulations, a significant deviation regarding the predicted $\Delta$H$_{\rm mix}$ was seen if computed directly from the molecular dynamic trajectories. The integrated experimental and simulation data within the MIVM formalism are generalizable to a wide variety of molten salts and demonstrate a significant improvement over currently employed methods to study molten salts for nuclear and separations sciences.</description>

      <title>Significantly Enhanced Interfacial Thermal Transport between Single-layer Graphene and Water Through Basal-plane Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer between graphene and water is pivotal for various applications, including solarthermal vapor generation and the advanced manufacturing of graphene-based hierarchical structures in solution. In this study, we employ a deep-neural network potential derived from ab initio molecular dynamics to conduct extensive simulations of single-layer graphenewater systems with different levels of oxidation (carbon/oxygen ratio) of the graphene layer. Remarkably, our findings reveal a one-order-of-magnitude enhancement in heat transfer upon oxidizing graphene with hydroxyl or epoxide groups at the graphene surface, underscoring the significant tunability of heat transfer within this system. Given the same oxidation ratio, more dispersed locations of functional groups on graphene surface leads to faster heat dissipation to water.</description>

      <title>Exact scattering cross section for lattice-defect scattering of phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of structurally complex lattice defects, such as functional groups, embedded nanoparticles, and nanopillars, to generate phonon scattering is a popular approach in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications. However, the theoretical treatment of this scattering phenomenon remains a formidable challenge, especially with regards to the determination of the scattering cross sections and rates associated with such lattice defects. Using the extended Atomistic Green's Function (AGF) method, we describe how the numerically exact mode-resolved scattering cross section \sigma can be computed for a phonon scattered by a single lattice defect. We illustrate the generality and utility of the AGF-based treatment with two examples. In the first example, we treat the isotopic scattering of phonons in a harmonic chain of atoms . In the second example, we treat the more complex problem of phonon scattering in a carbon nanotube (CNT) containing an encapsulated C60 molecule which acts as a scatterer of the CNT phonons. The application of this method can enable a more precise characterization of lattice-defect scattering and result in the more controlled use of nanostructuring and lattice defects in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of metastable target skyrmion states in continuous films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target skyrmions (TSks) are topological spin textures where the out-of-plane component of the magnetization twists an integer number of $m$-$\pi$ rotations. Based on a magnetic multilayer stack in the form of $n\times$[CoFeB/MgO/Ta], engineered to host topological spin textures via dipole and DMI energies, we have successfully stabilized 1$\pi$, 2$\pi$ and 3$\pi$ target skyrmions by tuning material properties and thermal excitations close to room temperature. The nucleated textures, imaged via Kerr and Magnetic Force Microscopies, are stable at zero magnetic field and robust within a range of temperatures (tens of Kelvin) close to room temperature (RT = 292 K) and over long time scales (months). Under applied field (mT), the TSks collapse into the central skyrmion core, which resists against higher magnetic fields ($\approx$ 2 $\times$ TSk annihilation field), as the core is topologically protected. Micromagnetic simulations support our experimental findings, showing no TSk nucleation at 0 K, but a $\approx$ 30 $\%$ probability at 300 K for the experimental sample parameters. Our work provides a simple method to tailor spin textures in continuous films, enabling free movement in 2D space, creating a platform transferable to technological applications where the dynamics of the topological textures can be exploited beyond geometrical confinements.</description>

      <title>Determination of crystal structure and physical properties of Ru2Al5 intermetallic from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel ordered intermetallic compounds have stimulated much interest. Ru-Al alloys are a prominent class of high-temperature structural materials, but the experimentally reported crystal structure of the intermetallic Ru2Al5 phase remains elusive and debatable. To resolve this controversy, we extensively explored the crystal structures of Ru2Al5 using first-principles calculations combined with crystal structure prediction technique. Among the calculated X-ray diffraction patterns and lattice parameters of five candidate Ru2Al5 structures, those of the orthorhombic Pmmn structure best aligned with recent experimental results. The structural stabilities of the five Ru2Al5 structures were confirmed through formation energy, elastic constants, and phonon spectrum calculations. We also comprehensively analyzed the mechanical and electronic properties of the five candidates. This work can guide the exploration of novel ordered intermetallic compounds in Ru-Al alloys.</description>

      <title>Exploration of new 212 MAB phases: M2AB2 (M=Mo, Ta; A=Ga, Ge) via DFT calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently developed MAB phases, an extension of the MAX phase, have sparked interest in research among scientists because of their better thermo-mechanical properties. In this paper, we have explored four new MAB phases M2AB2 (M=Mo, Ta and A=Ga, Ge) and studied the elastic, electronic, thermal, and optical properties to predict the possible applications. The stability of the new phases has been confirmed by calculating formation energy (Ef), formation enthalpy (H), phonon dispersion curve (PDC), and elastic constant (Cij). The study reveals that M2AB2 (M=Mo, Ta and A=Ga, Ge) exhibit significantly higher elastic constants, elastic moduli, and Vickers hardness values than their counterpart 211 borides. Higher Vickers hardness values of Ta2AB2 (A=Ga, Ge) than Mo2AB2 (A=Ga, Ge) have been explained based on the values of the bond overlap population. The analysis of the density of states and electronic band structure revealed the metallic nature of the borides under examination. The thermodynamic characteristics of M2AB2 (M=Mo, Ta and A=Ga, Ge) under high temperatures (0 to 1000 K) are investigated using the quasi-harmonic Debye model. Critical thermal properties such as melting temperature (Tm), Gruneisen parameter, minimum thermal conductivity (Kmin), Debye temperature, and others are also computed. Compared with 211 MAX phases, the 212 phases exhibit higher values of Debye temperature and Tm, along with a lower value of Kmin. These findings suggest that the studied compounds exhibit superior thermal properties that are suitable for practical applications. The optical characteristics have been examined, and the reflectance spectrum indicates that the materials have the potential to mitigate solar heating across various energy regions.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells via MultiFunctional Curcumin Modified Buried Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The buried interface between the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer suffers from severe interface defects and imperfect energy level alignment. To address this issue, this study employs a multifunctional organic molecule, curcumin, to modify the interface between SnO2 and the perovskite layer. The functional groups on curcumin effectively passivate the defects on both sides of the interface, reducing -OH and oxygen vacancy defects on the SnO2 surface and passivating uncoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite layer. This results in a more compatible energy level alignment and lower defect density at the interface, enhancing carrier transport across it. Consequently, the devices based on curcumin achieve an impressive champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.46%, compared to 22.03% for control devices. This work demonstrates a simple, green, hydrophobic, and efficient molecular modification method for the buried interface, laying the foundation for the development of high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Shock-driven amorphization and melt in Fe$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements on Fe$_2$O$_3$ amorphization and melt under laser-driven shock compression up to 209(10) GPa via time-resolved in situ x-ray diffraction. At 122(3) GPa, a diffuse signal is observed indicating the presence of a non-crystalline phase. Structure factors have been extracted up to 182(6) GPa showing the presence of two well-defined peaks. A rapid change in the intensity ratio of the two peaks is identified between 145(10) and 151(10) GPa, indicative of a phase change. Present DFT+$U$ calculations of temperatures along Fe$_2$O$_3$ Hugoniot are in agreement with SESAME 7440 and indicate relatively low temperatures, below 2000 K, up to 150 GPa. The non-crystalline diffuse scattering is thus consistent with the - as yet unreported - shock amorphization of Fe$_2$O$_3$ between 122(3) and 145(10) GPa, followed by an amorphous-to-liquid transition above 151(10) GPa. Upon release, a non-crystalline phase is observed alongside crystalline $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. The extracted structure factor and pair distribution function of this release phase resemble those reported for Fe$_2$O$_3$ melt at ambient pressure.</description>

Abstract: We propose differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging using energy-filtered electrons to image the magnetic properties of materials at the atomic scale. Compared to DPC measurements with elastic electrons, our simulations predict about two orders of magnitude higher relative magnetic signal intensities and sensitivity to all three vector components of magnetization.</description>

      <title>A Generic and Automated Methodology to Simulate Melting Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The melting point of a material constitutes a pivotal property with profound implications across various disciplines of science, engineering, and technology. Recent advancements in machine learning potentials have revolutionized the field, enabling ab initio predictions of materials' melting points through atomic-scale simulations. However, a universal simulation methodology that can be universally applied to any material remains elusive. In this paper, we present a generic, fully automated workflow designed to predict the melting points of materials utilizing molecular dynamics simulations. This workflow incorporates two tailored simulation modalities, each addressing scenarios with and without elemental partitioning between solid and liquid phases. When the compositions of both phases remain unchanged upon melting or solidification, signifying the absence of partitioning, the melting point is identified as the temperature at which these phases coexist in equilibrium. Conversely, in cases where elemental partitioning occurs, our workflow estimates both the nominal melting point, marking the initial transition from solid to liquid, and the nominal solidification point, indicating the reverse process. To ensure precision in determining these critical temperatures, we employ an innovative temperature-volume data fitting technique, suitable for a diverse range of materials exhibiting notable volume disparities between their solid and liquid states. This comprehensive approach offers a robust and versatile solution for predicting melting points, fostering advancements in materials science and technology.</description>

      <title>Introducing antiferromagnetic ordering on the surface states of Bi2Se3 topological insulator by Europium doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with an insulating bulk characterized by a gapped band structure, along with gapless metallic surface states having a Dirac cone with a helical spin structure in momentum space. The helical spin--momentum locking of the surface states arises from intrinsic spin--orbit coupling (SOC) and provides topological protection to the surface states against scattering from external perturbations, like defects and non-magnetic impurities. Breaking the topological protection of surface states of topological insulators is an essential prerequisite for exploring their applications. Rare-earth ions typically exhibit larger magnetic moments than transition-metal ions and thus promise the opening of a wider exchange gap in the Dirac surface states of topological insulators. Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is an interesting material; on the one hand, it has semiconducting properties when it is thin sheets; on the other hand, it's a topological insulator when the structure has a minimum of six quintuple layers (QLs), with diverse applications in photothermal, thermoelectric, and optical properties. Here, we have developed a controlled colloidal synthesis with low temperature and a cost-effective process for the synthesis of undoped and Eu-doped 2D layered Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheets. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a correlation between the shift of Dirac point position and the dopant content, which has been theoretically established by the band structure calculation. At low temperatures below 10K, for the 10\% Eu-doped sample, magnetic data suggests an antiferromagnetic ordering in the sample, which may be the contribution of the mixed valence state of Europium. Our results support that antiferromagnetic exchange interaction can exist in topological surface states in rare-earth Eu-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$, which can open a new window to novel quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of magnetic correlations, crystal electric field interactions, and spin-orbit coupling in low-dimensional frustrated magnets fosters novel ground states with unusual excitations. Here, we report the magnetic properties and crystal electric field (CEF) scheme of a rare-earth-based square-lattice antiferromagnet NdKNaNbO$_5$ investigated via magnetization, specific heat, electron spin resonance (ESR), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta_{\rm CW} \simeq -0.6$ K implies net antiferromagnetic interactions between the Nd$^{3+}$ ions. Two broad maxima are observed in the low temperature specific heat data in magnetic fields, indicating multilevel Schottky anomalies due to the effect of CEF. No magnetic long-range-order is detected down to 0.4 K. The CEF excitations of Kramers' ion Nd$^{3+}$ ($J=9/2$) probed via INS experiments evince dispersionless excitations characterizing the transitions among the CEF energy levels. The fit of the INS spectra enabled the mapping of the CEF Hamiltonian and the energy eigenvalues of the Kramers' doublets. The simulation using the obtained CEF parameters reproduces the broad maxima in specific heat in zero-field as well as in different applied fields. The significant contribution from $J_z = \pm 1/2$ state to the wave function of the ground state doublet indicates the role of strong quantum fluctuations at low temperatures. The magnetic ground state is found to be a Kramers' doublet with effective spin $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ at low temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Precise wave manipulation has undoubtedly forged the technological landscape we thrive in today. Although our understanding of wave phenomena has come a long way since the earliest observations of desert dunes or ocean waves, the unimpeded development of mathematics has enabled ever more complex and exotic physical phenomena to be comprehensively described. Here, we take wave manipulation a step further by introducing an unprecedented synthetic acoustic crystal capable of realizing simultaneous linear broadband conduction and nonlinear topological insulation, depicting a robust amplitude-dependent mode localized deep within - i.e. an amplitude-driven topological confinement of sound. The latter is achieved by means of an open acoustic waveguide lined with a chain of nonlocally and nonlinearly coupled active electroacoustic resonators. Starting from a comprehensive topological model for classical waves, we demonstrate that different topological regimes can be accessed by increasing driving amplitude and that topological robustness against coupling disorder is a direct consequence of symmetric and simultaneous response between coupled resonators. Theoretical predictions are validated by a fully programmable experimental apparatus capable of realizing the real-time manipulation of metacrystal properties. In all, our results provide a solid foundation for future research in the design and manipulation of classical waves in artificial materials involving nonlinearity, nonlocality, and non-hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Characterization of AlGaAs/GeSn heterojunction band alignment via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: GeSn-based SWIR lasers featuring imaging, sensing, and communications has gained dynamic development recently. However, the existing SiGeSn/GeSn double heterostructure lacks adequate electron confinement and is insufficient for room temperature lasing. The recently demonstrated semiconductor grafting technique provides a viable approach towards AlGaAs/GeSn p-i-n heterojunctions with better electron confinement and high-quality interfaces, promising for room temperature electrically pumped GeSn laser devices. Therefore, understanding and quantitatively characterizing the band alignment in this grafted heterojunction is crucial. In this study, we explore the band alignment in the grafted monocrystalline Al0.3Ga0.7As /Ge0.853Sn0.147 p-i-n heterojunction. We determined the bandgap values of AlGaAs and GeSn to be 1.81 eV and 0.434 eV by photoluminescence measurements, respectively. We further conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and extracted a valence band offset of 0.19 eV and a conduction band offset of 1.186 eV. A Type-I band alignment was confirmed which effectively confining electrons at the AlGaAs/GeSn interface. This study improves our understanding of the interfacial band structure in grafted AlGaAs/GeSn heterostructure, providing experimental evidence of the Type-I band alignment between AlGaAs and GeSn, and paving the way for their application in laser technologies.</description>

      <title>Full-Field Quantitative Visualization of Shock-Driven Pore Collapse and Failure Modes in PMMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic collapse of pores under shock loading is thought to be directly related to hot spot generation and material failure, which is critical to the performance of porous energetic and structural materials. However, the shock compression response of porous materials at the local, individual pore scale is not well understood. This study examines, quantitatively, the collapse phenomenon of a single spherical void in PMMA at shock stresses ranging from 0.4-1.0 GPa. Using a newly developed internal digital image correlation technique in conjunction with plate impact experiments, full-field quantitative deformation measurements are conducted in the material surrounding the collapsing pore for the first time. The experimental results reveal two failure mode transitions as shock stress is increased: (i) the first in-situ evidence of shear localization via adiabatic shear banding and (ii) dynamic fracture initiation at the pore surface. Numerical simulations using thermo-viscoplastic dynamic finite element analysis provide insights into the formation of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) and stresses at which failure mode transitions occur. Further numerical and theoretical modeling indicates the dynamic fracture to occur along the weakened material inside an adiabatic shear band. Finally, analysis of the evolution of pore asymmetry and models for ASB spacing elucidate the mechanisms for the shear band initiation sites, and elastostatic theory explains the experimentally observed ASB and fracture paths based on the directions of maximum shear.</description>

      <title>Dirac bilinears in condensed matter physics: Relativistic correction for observables and conjugate electromagnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent developments in electron chirality, we reconsider some microscopic physical quantities that have been overlooked or have received little attention in condensed matter physics, based on the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac bilinears in relativistic quantum theory. We identify the expression of physical quantities defined by the four-component Dirac field in terms of the two-component Schr\"odinger field, which is usually used in condensed matter physics, and clarify its conjugate electromagnetic field. This consideration bridges the fields of condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and particle physics, and paves the way to electromagnetic control of matter. Our findings provide a means of {\it ab initio} quantification of material characters such as chirality and axiality that are unique to low-symmetry materials, and stimulate the systematic search for useful, new functionalities.</description>

      <title>Physics-integrated Neural Network for Quantum Transport Prediction of Field-effect Transistor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-mechanics-based transport simulation is of importance for the design of ultra-short channel field-effect transistors (FETs) with its capability of understanding the physical mechanism, while facing the primary challenge of the high computational intensity. Traditional machine learning is expected to accelerate the optimization of FET design, yet its application in this field is limited by the lack of both high-fidelity datasets and the integration of physical knowledge. Here, we introduced a physics-integrated neural network framework to predict the transport curves of sub-5-nm gate-all-around (GAA) FETs using an in-house developed high-fidelity database. The transport curves in the database are collected from literature and our first-principles calculations. Beyond silicon, we included indium arsenide, indium phosphide, and selenium nanowires with different structural phases as the FET channel materials. Then, we built a physical-knowledge-integrated hyper vector neural network (PHVNN), in which five new physical features were added into the inputs for prediction transport characteristics, achieving a sufficiently low mean absolute error of 0.39. In particular, ~98% of the current prediction residuals are within one order of magnitude. Using PHVNN, we efficiently screened out the symmetric p-type GAA FETs that possess the same figures of merit with the n-type ones, which are crucial for the fabrication of homogeneous CMOS circuits. Finally, our automatic differentiation analysis provides interpretable insights into the PHVNN, which highlights the important contributions of our new input parameters and improves the reliability of PHVNN. Our approach provides an effective method for rapidly screening appropriate GAA FETs with the prospect of accelerating the design process of next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the properties of crystalline materials is crucial for targeted discovery, and this prediction is increasingly done with data-driven models. However, for many properties of interest, the number of materials for which a specific property has been determined is much smaller than the number of known materials. To overcome this disparity, we propose a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy for material property prediction. Our approach, crystal denoising self-supervised learning (CDSSL), pretrains predictive models (e.g., graph networks) with a pretext task based on recovering valid material structures when given perturbed versions of these structures. We demonstrate that CDSSL models out-perform models trained without SSL, across material types, properties, and dataset sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surprising discovery of superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c$ = 32 K in MoB$_2$ above 70 GPa has led to the search for related materials that may superconduct at similarly high $T_c$ values and lower pressures. We have studied the superconducting and structural properties of Re$_{0.10}$Mo$_{0.90}$B$_2$ to 170 GPa. A structural phase transition from R3m to P6/mmm commences at 48 GPa, with the first signatures of superconductivity appearing above 44 GPa. The critical temperature is observed to increase with pressure. A complete resistive transition is observed only above 150 GPa, where the highest onset $T_c$ of 30 K is also achieved. Upon releasing pressure, the high pressure superconducting phase is found to be metastable. During unloading, a complete resistive superconducting transition is observed all the way down to 20 GPa (with onset $T_c \sim 20$ K). Our results suggest that the P6/mmm structure is responsible for the observed superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Signatures of polarized chiral spin disproportionation in rare earth nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In rare earth nickelates (RENiO$_3$), electron-lattice coupling drives a concurrent metal-to-insulator and bond disproportionation phase transition whose microscopic origin has long been the subject of active debate. Of several proposed mechanisms, here we test the hypothesis that pairs of self-doped ligand holes spatially condense to provide local spin moments that are antiferromagnetically coupled to Ni spins. These singlet-like states provide a basis for long-range bond and spiral spin order. Using magnetic resonant X-ray scattering on NdNiO$_3$ thin films, we observe the chiral nature of the spin-disproportionated state, with spin spirals propagating along the crystallographic (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ direction. These spin spirals are found to preferentially couple to X-ray helicity, establishing the presence of a hitherto-unobserved macroscopic chirality. The presence of this chiral magnetic configuration suggests a potential multiferroic coupling between the noncollinear magnetic arrangement and improper ferroelectric behavior as observed in prior studies on NdNiO$_3$ (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ films and RENiO$_3$ single crystals. Experimentally constrained theoretical double-cluster calculations confirm the presence of an energetically stable spin-disproportionated state with Zhang-Rice singlet-like combinations of Ni and ligand moments.</description>

Abstract: Symmetries of three-dimensional periodic scalar fields are described by 230 space groups (SGs). Symmetries of three-dimensional periodic (pseudo-) vector fields, however, are described by the spin-space groups (SSGs), which were initially used to describe the symmetries of magnetic orders. In SSGs, the real-space and spin degrees of freedom are unlocked in the sense that an operation could have different spacial and spin rotations. SSGs gives a complete symmetry description of magnetic structures, and have natural applications in the band theory of itinerary electrons in magnetically ordered systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. Altermagnetism, a concept raised recently that belongs to the symmetry-compensated collinear magnetic orders but has non-relativistic spin splitting, is well described by SSGs. Due to the vast number and complicated group structures, SSGs have not yet been systematically enumerated. In this work, we exhaust SSGs based on the invariant subgroups of SGs, with spin operations constructed from three-dimensional (3D) real representations of the quotient groups for the invariant subgroups. For collinear and coplanar magnetic orders, the spin operations can be reduced into lower dimensional real representations. As the number of SSGs is infinite, we only consider SSGs that describe magnetic unit cells up to 12 times crystal unit cells. We obtain 157,289 non-coplanar, 24,788 coplanar-non-collinear, and 1,421 collinear SSGs. The enumerated SSGs are stored in an online database at \url{https://cmpdc.iphy.ac.cn/ssg} with a user-friendly interface. We also develop an algorithm to identify SSG for realistic materials and find SSGs for 1,626 magnetic materials. Our results serve as a solid starting point for further studies of symmetry and topology in magnetically ordered materials.</description>

      <title>High mobility charge transport in a multicarrier altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A newly identified magnetic phase called altermagnet is being actively studied because of its unprecedented spin-dependent phenomena. Among the candidate materials, CrSb has a particularly high ordering temperature and a large spin-splitting energy, but its transport properties have remained unexplored. In this study, we report the magnetotransport properties of CrSb measured on single crystals. We found that the Hall resistivity shows a nonlinear dependence on the magnetic field at low temperatures. From symmetry-based considerations, however, this behavior can not be attributed to an anomalous Hall effect, but to a multicarrier effect. A multicarrier fitting to the in-plane conductivity tensor revealed the presence of carriers with high mobility in CrSb, which is an advantage for efficient spin current generation.</description>

      <title>Quenched pair breaking by interlayer correlations as a key to superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the leading pairing instability, $s \pm$-wave, is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Jupyter widgets and extensions for education and research in computational physics and chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive notebooks are a precious tool for creating graphical user interfaces and teaching materials. Python and Jupyter are becoming increasingly popular in this context, with Jupyter widgets at the core of the interactive functionalities. However, while packages and libraries which offer a broad range of general-purpose widgets exist, there is limited development of specialized widgets for computational physics, chemistry and materials science. This deficiency implies significant time investments for the development of effective Jupyter notebooks for research and education in these domains. Here, we present custom Jupyter widgets that we have developed to target the needs of these communities. These widgets constitute high-quality interactive graphical components and can be employed, for example, to visualize and manipulate data, or to explore different visual representations of concepts, clarifying the relationships existing between them. In addition, we discuss with one example how similar functionality can be exposed in the form of JupyterLab extensions, modifying the JupyterLab interface for an enhanced user experience when working with applications within the targeted scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Generative Design of Crystal Structures by Point Cloud Representations and Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently generating energetically stable crystal structures has long been a challenge in material design, primarily due to the immense arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice. To facilitate the discovery of stable material, we present a framework for the generation of synthesizable materials, leveraging a point cloud representation to encode intricate structural information. At the heart of this framework lies the introduction of a diffusion model as its foundational pillar. To gauge the efficacy of our approach, we employ it to reconstruct input structures from our training datasets, rigorously validating its high reconstruction performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the profound potential of Point Cloud-Based Crystal Diffusion (PCCD) by generating entirely new materials, emphasizing their synthesizability. Our research stands as a noteworthy contribution to the advancement of materials design and synthesis through the cutting-edge avenue of generative design instead of the conventional substitution or experience-based discovery.</description>

      <title>A mathematical justification for nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic framework that rigorously generates nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain for elastic bodies. Each of these relations arises as the leading order relationship satisfied by a one-parameter family of nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and nonlinear strain. The asymptotic parameter limits the overall range of strains that satisfy the corresponding constitutive relation in the one-parameter family while the stresses can remain large (relative to a fixed stress scale). This differs from classical linearized elasticity where a fixed constitutive relation is assumed, and the magnitude of the displacement gradient serves as the asymptotic parameter. Also unlike classical approaches, the constitutive relations in our framework are expressed as implicit relationships between stress and strain rather than requiring stress explicitly expressed as a function of strain, adding conceptual simplicity and versatility. We demonstrate that our framework rigorously justifies nonlinear constitutive relations between stress and linearized strain including those with density-dependent Young's moduli or derived from strain energies beyond quadratic forms.</description>
