      <title>GIC--Related Observations During the May 2024 Geomagnetic Storm in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The May 2024 geomagnetic storm was one of the most severe in the past twenty years. Understanding how large geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) impact geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) within power grid networks is key to ensuring their resilience. We have assembled and synthesized a large and diverse set of GMD-related data, compared model predictions with measurements, and identified empirical relationships for GICs in the contiguous United States for this storm.
  Measurement data include GIC data from $47$ sites and magnetometer data from $17$ magnetometer sites. Model data include computed GIC by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) power system operators at four sites, GIC computed using a reference model at $47$ sites, $\Delta \mathbf{B}$ at 12 magnetometer sites from the Multiscale Atmosphere-Geospace Environment Model (MAGE), Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), and Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM) global magnetosphere models, and $\mathbf{\beta}$ scaling factors derived from magnetotelluric (MT) transfer functions at $\sim 5,000$ MT sites.
  GIC measured and modeled by TVA had a correlation coefficient $&gt;0.8$ and a prediction efficiency between $0.4$ and $0.7$. The horizontal magnetic field pertubation from a basline, $\Delta B_H$, predicted by MAGE, SWMF, and OpenGGCM had a correlation that ranged from $0.4$ to $0.6$. Two empirical relationships were considered: (1) how the correlation between measured GIC site pairs depended on differences in site separation distance, $\beta$ scaling factor, and latitude; and (2) a regression model that predicts the standard deviation and maximum GIC magnitude at each site given inputs of site latitude and $\beta$.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that stochastic and quasi-linear ion heating, often viewed as distinct processes in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas, are the far limits of a continuum controlled by nonlinear broadening of turbulent fluctuations, and thus by the normalized cross helicity.} We propose a simple empirical formula that captures both regimes, generalizing that commonly used to describe stochastic heating. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as seen in the solar wind. \revchange{Our results provide a unified framework for understanding ion heating processes across diverse astrophysical environments from black-hole accretion disks to the solar corona, also providing a compact and versatile subgrid model for larger-scale simulations.</description>
