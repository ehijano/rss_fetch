      <title>Rare dense solutions clusters in asymmetric binary perceptrons -- local entropy via fully lifted RDT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated \emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness. Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance (\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete defragmentation.
  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade, sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-ergodic multifractal quantum states in geometrical fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>

      <title>Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations -- made tractable by the RBM's structure -- we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</description>

      <title>Effective conductivity of conduit networks with random conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective conductivity ($T^{eff}$) of 2D and 3D Random Resistor Networks (RRNs) with random edge conductivity are studied. The combined influence of geometrical disorder, which controls the overall connectivity of the medium, and leads to percolation effects, and conductivity randomness is investigated. A formula incorporating connectivity aspects and second-order averaging methods, widely used in the stochastic hydrology community, is derived and extrapolated to higher orders using a power averaging formula based on a mean-field argument. This approach highlights the role of the so-called resistance distance, introduced by graph theorists. Simulations are performed on various RRN geometries constructed from 2D and 3D bond-percolation lattices. The results confirm the robustness of the power averaging technique and the relevance of the mean-field assumption.</description>

      <title>Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi equations from mean-field spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12732v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a meaning to the Hamilton--Jacobi equation arising from mean-field spin glass models in the viscosity sense, and establish the corresponding well-posedness. Originally defined on the set of monotone probability measures, these equations can be interpreted, via an isometry, to be defined on an infinite-dimensional closed convex cone with an empty interior in a Hilbert space. We prove the comparison principle, and the convergence of finite-dimensional approximations furnishing the existence of solutions. Under additional convexity conditions, we show that the solution can be represented by a version of the Hopf--Lax formula, or the Hopf formula on cones. Previously, two notions of solutions were considered, one defined directly as the Hopf--Lax formula, and another as limits of finite-dimensional approximations. They have been proven to describe the limit free energy in a wide class of mean-field spin glass models. This work shows that these two kinds of solutions are viscosity solutions.</description>

      <title>Holographic deep thermalization for secure and efficient quantum random state generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomness is a cornerstone of science, underpinning fields such as statistics, information theory, dynamical systems, and thermodynamics. In quantum science, quantum randomness, especially random pure states, plays a pivotal role in fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine $5$-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of $8$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work deepens our understanding of quantum state evolution and lays the foundation for accurately capturing novel quantum dynamical behaviour.</description>

      <title>First-Passage Approach to Optimizing Perturbations for Improved Training of Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done ad hoc by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We employ this approach to a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and identify a useful perturbation and frequency among several possibilities. We demonstrate the transferability of the approach to other datasets, architectures, optimizers and even tasks (regression instead of classification). Our work allows optimization of perturbations for improving the training of machine learning models using a first-passage approach.</description>
