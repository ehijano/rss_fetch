      <title>Beam-driven Electron Cyclotron Harmonic and Whistler-mode Waves as Seen in Particle-In-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent study has demonstrated that electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves can be excited by a low energy electron beam. Such waves propagate at moderately oblique wave normal angles ~70. The potential role of beam-driven ECH waves in affecting electron dynamics in Earth's plasma sheet is not known. Using two-dimensional Darwin particle-in-cell simulations with initial electron distributions that represent typical plasma conditions in the plasma sheet, we explore the excitation and saturation of such beam-driven ECH waves. Both ECH and whistler-mode waves are excited in the simulation and propagate at oblique wave normal angles. Compared with the whistler-mode waves, ECH waves grow much faster and have more intense saturation amplitudes. Cold, stationary electrons are first accelerated by ECH waves through cyclotron resonance and then accelerated in the parallel direction by both the ECH and whistler-mode waves through Landau resonance. Beam electrons, on the other hand, are decelerated in the parallel direction and scattered to larger pitch angles. The relaxation of the electron beam and the continuous heating of the cold electrons contribute to the saturation of ECH waves and suppress the excitation of whistler-mode waves. When the ratio of plasma to electron cyclotron frequency wpe/wce increases, the ECH wave amplitude increases while the whistler-mode wave amplitude decreases. Our work reveals the importance of ECH and whistler-mode waves in reshaping sub-thermal electron distributions and improves our understanding on the potential effects of wave-particle interactions in trapping ionospheric electron outflows and forming anisotropic (field-aligned) electron distributions in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Data-driven sparse modeling of oscillations in plasma space propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algorithm to obtain data-driven models of oscillatory phenomena in plasma space propulsion systems is presented, based on sparse regression (SINDy) and Pareto front analysis. The algorithm can incorporate physical constraints, use data bootstrapping for additional robustness, and fine-tuning to different metrics. Standard, weak and integral SINDy formulations are discussed and compared. The scheme is benchmarked in the case of breathing-mode oscillations in Hall effect thrusters, using PIC/fluid simulation data. Models of varying complexity are obtained for the average plasma properties, and shown to have a clear physical interpretability and agreement with existing 0D models in the literature. Lastly, the algorithm applied is also shown to enable the identification of physical subdomains with qualitatively different plasma dynamics, providing valuable information for more advanced modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>High-energy polarized electron beams from the ionization of isolated spin polarized hydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a laser-based method for the preparation of high-energy, highly-polarized electrons, from the ionization of isolated spin-polarized hydrogen (SPH) atoms. The SPH atoms are prepared from the photodissociation of HBr, using two consecutive shaped UV pulses of ps duration. By appropriately timing and focusing the pulses, we can spatially separate the highly polarized SPH from other unwanted photoproducts, which then act as the target for the ion-acceleration lasers. The density of SPH can surpass $\approx$10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, allowing the production of GeV electrons with polarization larger than 90%.</description>

      <title>Resonant emittance mixing of flat beams in plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma accelerators sustain large field gradients and could enable future compact linear colliders. To achieve the required high luminosity, linear colliders rely on flat beams to avoid potentially deleterious beamstrahlung effects. Here, we show that flat beams in plasma accelerators can be subject to beam quality degradation due to emittance mixing caused by transverse coupling in the wakefields. When there is a resonance between the betatron oscillations in the horizontal and vertical planes for the beam particles in a coupled wakefield, the transverse emittances fully exchange, leading to a round beam. Depending on the mechanism causing the resonance, the use of laser drivers, flat particle beam drivers, or hollow plasma channels can avoid the resonance and mitigate the emittance deterioration.</description>

      <title>A New Mechanism For Generating Type-III Radiation From The Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because the conventional method of creating type-III radiation by coalescence of counter-propagating Langmuir waves has not been verified with in-situ data, Parker Solar Probe data was examined in search of such in-situ evidence, which was not found. Instead, a new mechanism for creating type-III radiation has been found as a result of observing slow Langmuir waves (~2200 km/sec) with electric fields as large as 300 mV/m during a developing type-III burst on March 21, 2023. Because of their slow phase velocities, these Langmuir waves had short wavelengths, several times the Debye length of 2.65 meters, and, as a result, k{\lambda}d~0.93. Such waves may be strongly damped to be replaced by new growing bursts of waves that create the characteristic Langmuir waveform that is composed of peaks and valleys of a few milliseconds duration. The average electron current that produced these Langmuir waves is estimated from the Generalized Ohms law to be ~15 microamps/m2 and, from the strahl, 8 microamps/m2. Peak currents were at least twice these averages. These Langmuir waves, acting as antennas, produced electrostatic harmonics having slow phase velocities (~2000 km/sec) at frequencies of n{\omega}p, where {\omega}p = 6.28*125 kHz is the Langmuir wave frequency and n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Such waves are not the type-III emission. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through the huge density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation.</description>

      <title>Fusion energy commercialization requires solving social and environmental challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusion energy, the process that uses the same reaction that powers the sun and the stars, offers the promise of virtually unlimited, carbon-free energy and is approaching reality. Recently, there's been a dramatic global increase in the investment and research focused on addressing the hurdles to commercialize fusion energy. While a majority of the effort has been focused on gaps in technology, little work has been done to address the societal and environmental impacts of this technology. Three community- and environmentally-focused research priorities are identified for commercializing fusion energy: 1) understanding the environmental impacts of fusion energy across the technology lifecycle, 2) developing risk and safety assessment methodologies for fusion power plant technologies, and 3) creating a community-based socially engaged approach for fusion technology design and development. This approach will benefit private companies who wish to deploy future fusion power plants as concerns about the technology will be addressed early in the design process, thus minimizing delays in deployment that may result in increased costs for developers. Community engagement around fusion technology development must be evidence-based in order to build trust between communities and technology developers. Such an approach is grounded in informed consent is vital for the sustainable development and use of fusion technologies.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Solar Energetic Particles in 3D MHD Simulations of the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propagate relativistic test particles in the field of a steady 3D MHD simulations of the solar wind. We use the MPI-AMRVAC code for the wind simulations and integrate the relativistic guiding center equations using a new third-order accurate time integration scheme to solve the particle trajectories. Diffusion in velocity space, given a particle-turbulence mean free path $\lambda_\parallel$ along the magnetic field, is also included. Preliminary results for $81\:{\rm keV}$ electrons injected at 0.139 AU heliocentric distance and mean free path $\lambda_\parallel =0.5\:{\rm AU}$ are in a good qualitative agreement with measurements at 1 AU.</description>

      <title>Electron Collision Cross Sections in Tetrafluoropropene HFO1234ze(E) for Gas Mixtures in Resistive Plate Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.08643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in tetrafluoropropene HFO1234ze(E) (C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$) for Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs). This novel gas is considered a promising alternative to the standard mixtures currently used in RPCs, thanks to its low global warming potential. The knowledge of electron collision cross sections in C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ enables reliable predictions of electron transport coefficients and reaction rates in C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$-based gas mixtures. This allows for optimizing the C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$-based gas mixtures to achieve the desired performance in RPCs.
  From measurements of electron transport coefficients and reaction rates, a complete set of scattering cross sections for electrons in C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ has been derived. Validation of the electron collision cross sections is achieved through systematic comparisons of electron swarm parameters with experimental data in both pure C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ and C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$/CO$_{2}$ gas mixtures. Given the influence of electron attachment in C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ by the gas density, this work also includes precise calculations of the critical electric field strength in such mixtures. This set of cross sections has been further utilized to compute the effective ionization Townsend coefficient in gas mixtures containing C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$, potentially applicable for RPCs.</description>

      <title>MCTrans++: A 0-D Model for Centrifugal Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The centrifugal mirror confinement scheme incorporates supersonic rotation of a plasma into a magnetic mirror device. This concept has been shown experimentally to drastically decrease parallel losses and increase plasma stability as compared to prior axisymmetric mirrors. MCTrans++ is a 0D scoping tool which rapidly models experimental operating points in the Centrifugal Mirror Fusion Experiment (CMFX) at the University of Maryland. In the low-collisionality regime, parallel losses can be modeled analytically. A confining potential is set up that is partially ambipolar and partially centrifugal. Due to the stabilizing effects of flow-shear, the perpendicular losses can be modeled as classical. Radiation losses such as Bremsstrahlung and cyclotron emission are taken into account. A neutrals model is included, and, in some circumstances, charge-exchange losses are found to exceed all other loss mechanisms. We use the SUNDIALS ARKODE library to solve the underlying equations of this model; the resulting software is suitable for scanning large parameter spaces, and can also be used to model time-dependent phenomena such as a capacitive discharge. MCTrans++ has been used to verify results from prior centrifugal mirrors, create an experimental plan for CMFX, and find configurations for future reactor-scale fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant scattering of energetic electrons by electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves: spacecraft observations and theoretical framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves lead to rapid scattering of relativistic electrons in Earth's radiation belts, due to their large amplitudes relative to other waves that interact with electrons of this energy range. A central feature of electron precipitation driven by EMIC waves is deeply elusive. That is, moderate precipitating fluxes at energies below the minimum resonance energy of EMIC waves occur concurrently with strong precipitating fluxes at resonance energies in low-altitude spacecraft observations. This paper expands on a previously reported solution to this problem: nonresonant scattering due to wave packets. The quasi-linear diffusion model is generalized to incorporate nonresonant scattering by a generic wave shape. The diffusion rate decays exponentially away from the resonance, where shorter packets lower decay rates and thus widen the energy range of significant scattering. Using realistic EMIC wave packets from $\delta f$ particle-in-cell simulations, test particle simulations are performed to demonstrate that intense, short packets extend the energy of significant scattering well below the minimum resonance energy, consistent with our theoretical prediction. Finally, the calculated precipitating-to-trapped flux ratio of relativistic electrons is compared to ELFIN observations, and the wave power spectra is inferred based on the measured flux ratio. We demonstrate that even with a narrow wave spectrum, short EMIC wave packets can provide moderately intense precipitating fluxes well below the minimum resonance energy.</description>
