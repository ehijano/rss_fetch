      <title>How Far Can We Trust Chaos? Extending the Horizon of Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaos reveals a fundamental paradox in the scientific understanding of Complex Systems. Although chaotic models may be mathematically deterministic, they are practically non-determinable due to the finite precision, which is inherent in all computational machines. Beyond the horizon of predictability, numerical computations accumulate errors, often undetectable. We investigate the possibility of reliable (error-free) time series of chaos. We prove that this is feasible for two well-studied isomorphic chaotic maps, namely the Tent map and the Logistic map. The generated chaotic time series have unlimited horizon of predictability. A new linear formula for the horizon of predictability of the Analytic Computation of the Logistic map, for any given precision and acceptable error, is obtained. Reliable (error-free) time series of chaos serve as gold standard for chaos applications. The practical significance of our findings include: (i) the ability to compare the performance of neural networks that predict chaotic time series, (ii) the reliability and numerical accuracy of chaotic orbit computations in encryption, maintaining high cryptographic strength, and (iii) the reliable forecasting of future prices in chaotic economic and financial models.</description>

      <title>The subtlety of the outermost stellarator magnetic surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytic model of the magnetic field line behavior in a stellarator is used to study the subtlety of the concept of an outermost magnetic surface. The analytic model that we use has a central region of nested magnetic surfaces. The outermost perfectly confining surface has a toroidal flux of 0.86 of the toroidal flux of the outermost confining surface. The field lines in the annulus between these surfaces strike a distant wall, but they make tens of thousands of transits through a period of the stellarator before doing so. The number of transits is so large that this region can probably be viewed as having confining surfaces. Between the outermost confining surface and a surface at 1.02 times the toroidal flux field lines go to the walls in four flux tubes: two with inward flux and two with outward flux. One of the inward-outward pairs of flux tubes are adjoining and the other pair is separated. When the toroidal flux is greater than 1.02 of that of the outermost confining surface approximately 85% of the field lines strike the wall before transiting a single period. The loss of plasma from this region is so fast compared to cross-field plasma diffusion that they are probably irrelevant to the study of divertors. In addition to the two inward-outward flux tube pairs that escape from the region inside 1.02 times the flux of the confining region, the outer region has two new inward-outward of flux-tube pairs; one adjoining and one separated.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of hydrodynamics in a one-dimensional cold gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following model is studied analytically and numerically: point particles with masses $m,\mu,m, \dots$ ($m\geq\mu$) are distributed over the positive half-axis. Their dynamics is initiated by giving a positive velocity to the particle located at the origin; in its course the particles undergo elastic collisions. We show that, for certain values of $m/\mu$, starting from the initial state where the particles are equidistant the system evolves in a hydrodynamic way: (i) the rightmost particle (blast front) moves as $t^{\delta}$ with $\delta &lt; 1$; (ii) recoiled particles behind the front enter the negative half-axis; (iii) the splatter -- the particles with locations $x\leq 0$ -- moves in the ballistic way and eventually takes over the whole energy of the system. These results agree with those obtained in S. Chakraborti et al, SciPost Phys. 2022, 13, 074, for $m/\mu=2$ and random initial particle positions. At the same time, we explicitly found the collection of positive numbers $\{\mathcal{M}_i, i \in \mathbf{N} \}$ such that, for $m/\mu = \mathcal{M}_i$, $i\leq 700$, the following holds: (a) the splatter is absent; (b) the number of simultaneously moving particles is at most three; (c) the blast front moves in the ballistic way. However, if, similarly as in S. Chakraborti et al, the particle positions are sampled from a uniformly distributed ensemble, for $m/\mu = \mathcal{M}_i$ the system evolves in a hydrodynamic way.</description>

      <title>A theory for self-sustained balanced states in absence of strong external currents</title>

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks with balanced excitation and inhibition exhibit irregular asynchronous dynamics, which is fundamental for cortical computations. Classical balance mechanisms require strong external inputs to sustain finite firing rates, raising concerns about their biological plausibility. Here, we investigate an alternative mechanism based on short-term synaptic depression (STD) acting on excitatory-excitatory synapses, which dynamically balances the network activity without the need of external inputs. By employing numerical simulations and theoretical investigations we characterize the dynamics of a massively coupled network made up of $N$ rate-neuron models. Depending on the synaptic strength $J_0$, the network exhibits two distinct regimes: at sufficiently small $J_0$, it converges to a homogeneous fixed point, while for sufficiently large $J_0$, it exhibits Rate Chaos. For finite networks, we observe several different routes to chaos depending on the network realization. The width of the transition region separating the homogeneous stable solution from Rate Chaos appears to shrink for increasing $N$ and eventually to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. The characterization of the Rate Chaos regime performed by employing Dynamical Mean Field approaches allow us on one side to confirm that this novel balancing mechanism is able to sustain finite irregular activity even in the thermodynamic limit, and on the other side to reveal that the balancing occurs via dynamic cancellation of the input correlations generated by the massive coupling. Our findings show that STD provides an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism for balanced networks, sustaining irregular yet stable activity without the need of biologically unrealistic inputs. This work extends the balanced network paradigm, offering insights into how cortical circuits could maintain robust dynamics via synaptic adaptation.</description>

      <title>Improved Stability Estimates and Flight Time Predictions Using Higher-Order Transverse Discontinuity Mapping in Hybrid Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article emphasizes on inconsistencies in the dynamical estimates obtained by first-order transverse discontinuity mapping (TDM) and direct numerical observations for hybrid dynamical systems. Pitfalls of locally linearizing hybrid nonlinear dynamical systems near discontinuity boundaries are demonstrated along with examples of how such linearization could lead to incorrect estimates of impact occurrences for transverse interactions with a rigid barrier. A higher-order TDM is proposed to overcome this shortcoming, allowing for better analytical estimation of impact occurrence times, state transitions, and, consequently, the evolution of trajectories. The difference in flight times of two closely initiated trajectories in the local neighbourhood of a discontinuity boundary is estimated up to $\mathcal{O}(2)$. The resulting quadratic equation implies that the orbits local to the impacting state, corresponding to a negative discriminant, won't reach the discontinuity boundary. Further, the $\mathcal{O}(2)$ correction terms to the analytical expression of the TDM ensure that the flight time estimates do not diverge for low-velocity impacts near grazing, thereby avoiding overestimation of the mapped state. A numerical method is subsequently developed to estimate a saltation matrix incorporating the proposed higher-order TDM to avoid incorrect impact occurrences. Modifications to the existing algorithms used to numerically quantify local stability, namely the Lyapunov spectra and Floquet multipliers, are proposed. Stability analyses using the proposed higher-order approach are carried out for representative cases of a hard impact oscillator and a pair impact oscillator, with results consistent with numerically obtained bifurcation diagrams.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Chaotic Itinerancy Phenomenon using Entropy and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems, we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with the help of some statistical tests. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on the system of globally coupled logistic maps (GCM), a well-known model exhibiting chaotic itinerancy. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as coherent and intermittent phases.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in the complexified Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an $N$-oscillators complexified Kuramoto model. We first observe that there are solutions exhibiting finite-time blow-up behavior in all coupling regimes. When the coupling strength $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$, sufficient conditions for various types of synchronization are established for general $N \geq 2$. On the other hand, we analyze the case when the coupling strength is weak. For $N=2$ with coupling below $\lambda_c$, our complex-analytic approach not only recovers the periodic orbits reported by Th\"umler--Srinivas--Schr\"oder--Timme but also provides, for the first time, their exact period $T_{\omega,\lambda}=2\pi/\sqrt{\omega^{2}-\lambda^{2}}$, confirming full phase locking. Furthermore, for the critical case $\lambda = \lambda_c$, we find that the complexified Kuramoto system admits homoclinic orbits. These phenomena significantly differentiate the complexified Kuramoto model from the real Kuramoto system, as synchronization never occurs when $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$ in the latter. For $N=3$, we demonstrate that if the natural frequencies are in arithmetic progression, non-trivial synchronization states can be achieved for certain initial conditions even when the coupling strength is weak. In particular, we characterize the critical coupling strength ($\lambda/\lambda_c = 0.85218915...$) such that a semistable equilibrium point in the real Kuramoto model bifurcates into a pair of stable and unstable equilibria, marking a new phenomenon in complexified Kuramoto models.</description>
