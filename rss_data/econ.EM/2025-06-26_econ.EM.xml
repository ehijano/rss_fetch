      <title>A Sharp and Robust Test for Selective Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a test that is consistent against every detectable form of selective reporting and remains interpretable even when the t-scores are not exactly normal. The test statistic is the distance between the smoothed empirical t-curve and the set of all t-curves that would be possible in the absence of any selective reporting. This novel projection test can only be evaded in large meta-samples by selective reporting that also evades all other valid tests of restrictions on the t-curve. A second benefit of the projection test is that under the null we can interpret the projection residual as noise plus bias incurred from approximating the t-score's exact distribution with the normal. Applying the test to the Brodeur et al. (2020) meta-data, we find that the t-curves for RCTs, IVs, and DIDs are more distorted than could arise by chance. But an Edgeworth Expansion reveals that these distortions are small enough to be plausibly explained by the only approximate normality of the individual t-scores. The detection of selective reporting in this meta-sample is therefore more fragile than previously known.</description>

      <title>Daily Fluctuations in Weather and Economic Growth at the Subnational Level: Evidence from Thailand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the historical relationship between temperature fluctuations and Thailand's aggregate economic output. The results show inverted-U shape temperature effects on the annual growth rate of provincial output per capita. The estimated marginal change in the annual growth rate of provincial output per capita of a 1 degree Celsius temperature increase is between -1.248 and -3.799 percentage points, depending on the functional form used. I find that the warming temperature may affect the growth of economic output rather than its level. The results also suggest that temperature changes affect output growth only in the agricultural sector, but not in the industrial and service sectors. Province-level projections under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios show that climate change will affect half of the Thai population by 2050. Projections show that climate change will make 62% (RCP4.5) and 86% (RCP8.5) of the Thai population poorer in per-capita terms than they would be in the absence of climate change in 2090. Nonetheless, these projections are sensitive to potential biases in future climate projections, particularly in models that do not account for lagged effects. All projections should be interpreted with caution.</description>

      <title>Anytime-Valid Inference in Adaptive Experiments: Covariate Adjustment and Balanced Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive experiments have become central to modern experimental design, enabling researchers to efficiently identify optimal treatments, improve statistical power, and maximize respondent welfare. However, adaptive experiments compromise valid inference and leave sub-optimal treatments underpowered. We introduce two methodological advances for adaptive experimentation. First, covariate-adjusted Mixture Adaptive Design (MADCovar) achieves substantial improvements in average treatment effect (ATE) precision by incorporating covariate adjustment within an anytime-valid inference framework. Second, power-modified MAD (MADMod) reallocates sample to underpowered treatment arms, improving statistical power across all treatments while maintaining error control. Both methods provide anytime-valid guarantees, enabling continuous monitoring without inflating Type 1 error rates. Simulation studies and empirical analyses demonstrate that MADCovar delivers significant precision gains and that MADMod ensures robust inference even for suboptimal treatments. Together, these methods address key limitations of adaptive experiments and equip researchers with practical tools for precise and reliable causal inference. Our proposed methods are implemented through an open-source software package.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Heteroskedasticity in Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear regressions with endogeneity are widely used to estimate causal effects. This paper studies a framework that involves two common issues: endogeneity of the regressors and heteroskedasticity that depends on endogenous regressors-i.e., endogenous heteroskedasticity. We show that the presence of endogenous heteroskedasticity in the structural regression renders the two-stage least squares estimator inconsistent. To address this issue, we propose sufficient conditions and a control function approach to identify and estimate the causal parameters of interest. We establish the limiting properties of the estimator--namely, consistency and asymptotic normality--and propose inference procedures. Monte Carlo simulations provide evidence on the finite-sample performance of the proposed methods and evaluate different implementation strategies. We revisit an empirical application on job training to illustrate the methods.</description>

      <title>Inference with few treated units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many causal inference applications, only one or a few units (or clusters of units) are treated. An important challenge in such settings is that standard inference methods that rely on asymptotic theory may be unreliable, even when the total number of units is large. This survey reviews and categorizes inference methods that are designed to accommodate few treated units, considering both cross-sectional and panel data methods. We discuss trade-offs and connections between different approaches. In doing so, we propose slight modifications to improve the finite-sample validity of some methods, and we also provide theoretical justifications for existing heuristic approaches that have been proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Latent Variable Autoregression with Exogenous Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new least squares regression methodology called (C)LARX: a (constrained) latent variable autoregressive model with exogenous inputs. Two additional contributions are made as a side effect: First, a new matrix operator is introduced for matrices and vectors with blocks along one dimension; Second, a new latent variable regression (LVR) framework is proposed for economics and finance. The empirical section examines how well the stock market predicts real economic activity in the United States. (C)LARX models outperform the baseline OLS specification in out-of-sample forecasts and offer novel analytical insights about the underlying functional relationship.</description>
