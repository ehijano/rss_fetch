      <title>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Piecewise linear cusp bifurcations in ultradiscrete dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of cusp bifurcations in max-plus dynamical systems derived from continuous differential equations through the tropical discretization and the ultradiscrete limit. A general relationship between cusp bifurcations in continuous and corresponding discrete systems is formulated as a proposition. For applications of this proposition, we analyze the Ludwig and Lewis models, elucidating the dynamical structure of their ultradiscrete cusp bifurcations obtained from the original continuous models. In the resulting ultradiscrete max-plus systems, the cusp bifurcation is characterized by piecewise linear representations, and its behavior is examined through the graph analysis.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in the Inverted Triangular Soft Lorentz Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate diffusion in a two-dimensional inverted soft Lorentz gas, where attractive Fermi-type potential wells are arranged in a triangular lattice. This configuration contrasts with earlier studies of soft Lorentz gases involving repulsive scatterers. By systematically varying the gap width and softness of the potential, we explore a rich landscape of diffusive behaviors. We present numerical simulations of the mean squared displacement and compute diffusion coefficients, identifying tongue-like structures in parameter space associated with quasiballistic transport. Furthermore, we develop an extension to the Machta-Zwanzig approximation that incorporates correlated multi-hop trajectories and correct for the influence of localized periodic orbits. Our findings highlight the qualitative and quantitative differences between inverted and repulsive soft Lorentz gases and offer new insights into transport phenomena in smooth periodic potentials.</description>

      <title>Structural Origins and Real-Time Drivers of Intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general terms, intermittency is the property for which time evolving systems alternate among two or more different regimes. Predicting the instance when the regime switch will occur is extremely challenging, often practically impossible. Intermittent processes include turbulence, convection, precipitation patterns, as well as several in plasma physics, medicine, neuroscience, and economics. Traditionally, focus has been on global statistical indicators, e.g. the average frequency of regime changes under fixed conditions, or how these vary as a function of the system's parameters. We add a local perspective: we study the causes and drivers of the regime changes in real time, with the ultimate goal of predicting them. Using five different systems, of various complexities, we identify indicators and precursors of regime transitions that are common across the different intermittency mechanisms and dynamical models. For all the systems and intermittency types under study, we find a correlation between the alignment of some Lyapunov vectors and the concomitant, or aftermath, regime change. We discovered peculiar behaviors in the Lorenz 96 and in the Kuramoto-Shivanshinki models. In Lorenz 96 we identified crisis-induced intermittency with laminar intermissions, while in the Kuramoto-Shivanshinki we detected a spatially global intermittency which follows the scaling of type-I intermittency. The identification of general mechanisms driving intermittent behaviors, and in particular the unearthing of indicators spotting the regime change, pave the way to designing prediction tools in more realistic scenarios. These include turbulent geophysical fluids, rainfall patterns, or atmospheric deep convection.</description>

      <title>Predicting Instabilities in Transient Landforms and Interconnected Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many parts of the Earth system are thought to have multiple stable equilibrium states, with the potential for rapid and sometimes catastrophic shifts between them. The most common frameworks for analyzing stability changes, however, require stationary (trend- and seasonality-free) data, which necessitates error-prone data pre-processing. Here we propose a novel method of quantifying system stability based on eigenvalue tracking and Floquet Multipliers, which can be applied directly to diverse data without first removing trend and seasonality, and is robust to changing noise levels, as can be caused by merging signals from different sensors. We first demonstrate this approach with synthetic data and further show how glacier surge onset can be predicted from observed surface velocity time series. We then show that our method can be extended to analyze spatio-temporal data and illustrate this flexibility with remotely sensed Amazon rainforest vegetation productivity, highlighting the spatial patterns of whole-ecosystem destabilization. Our work applies critical slowing down theory to glacier dynamics for the first time, and provides a novel and flexible method to quantify the stability or resilience of a wide range of spatiotemporal systems, including climate subsystems, ecosystems, and transient landforms.</description>

      <title>Hemispheric-Specific Coupling Improves Modeling of Functional Connectivity Using Wilson-Cowan Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale neural mass models have been widely used to simulate resting-state brain activity from structural connectivity. In this work, we extend a well-established Wilson--Cowan framework by introducing a novel hemispheric-specific coupling scheme that differentiates between intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric structural interactions. We apply this model to empirical cortical connectomes and resting-state fMRI data from matched control and schizophrenia groups. Simulated functional connectivity is computed from the band-limited envelope correlations of regional excitatory activity and compared against empirical functional connectivity matrices. Our results show that incorporating hemispheric asymmetries enhances the correlation between simulated and empirical functional connectivity, highlighting the importance of anatomically-informed coupling strategies in improving the biological realism of large-scale brain network models.</description>

      <title>Interferometric and Bipartite OTOC for Non-Markovian Open Quantum Spin-Chains and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators ($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively in the symmetry-broken phase.</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of diffusive U(1)-invariant qubit circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of translationally invariant magnetization-conserving qubit circuits via the spectrum of the quasi-momentum-resolved truncated propagator of extensive observables. Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one U(1) conserved quantity.</description>

      <title>External charged debris in a flowing plasma : charge fluctuation induced complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the response of a flowing e-i plasma to embedded external charged debris, focusing on the periodic debris charge fluctuations that can trigger complex phenomena such as chaos and nonlinear Landau damping. We employ both kinetic and fluid simulations to analyse the plasma response to the time-dependent debris charge. Our findings indicate that the nature of the nonlinear response can be considerably different for fluctuating positively charged external debris from negatively charged debris. The simulations show that the debris charge fluctuation causes damping of the ion-acoustic wave as the debris velocity nears the ion-acoustic speed through nonlinear Landau damping and wave-wave interactions. We also present a theoretical framework to support the simulation findings. Our findings provide critical insights into debris-plasma interactions, which may be useful in applications involving space debris management.</description>
