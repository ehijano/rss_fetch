      <title>A Microscopic Perspective on Moir\'e Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary quantum materials research is guided by themes of topology and of electronic correlations. A confluence of these two themes is engineered in "moir\'e materials", an emerging class of highly tunable, strongly correlated two-dimensional (2D) materials designed by the rotational or lattice misalignment of atomically thin crystals. In moir\'e materials, dominant Coulomb interactions among electrons give rise to collective electronic phases, often with robust topological properties. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for these exotic phases is fundamental to our understanding of strongly interacting quantum systems, and to our ability to engineer new material properties for potential future technological applications. In this Review, we highlight the contributions of local spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and electromagnetic probes to the budding field of moir\'e materials research. These techniques have not only identified many of the underlying mechanisms of the correlated insulators, generalized Wigner crystals, unconventional superconductors, moir\'e ferroelectrics, and topological orbital ferromagnets found in moir\'e materials, but they have also uncovered fragile quantum phases that have evaded spatially averaged global probes. Furthermore, we highlight recently developed local probe techniques, including local charge sensing and quantum interference probes, that have uncovered new physical observables in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Understanding Disorder in Monolayer Graphene Devices with Gate-Defined Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering superlattices (SLs) - which are spatially periodic potential landscapes for electrons - is an emerging approach for the realization of exotic properties, including superconductivity and correlated insulators, in two-dimensional materials. While moir\'e SL engineering has been a popular approach, nanopatterning is an attractive alternative offering control over the pattern and wavelength of the SL. However, the disorder arising in the system due to imperfect nanopatterning is seldom studied. Here, by creating a square lattice of nanoholes in the $SiO_2$ dielectric layer using nanolithography, we study the superlattice potential and the disorder formed in hBN-graphene-hBN heterostructures. Specifically, we observe that while electrical transport shows distinct superlattice satellite peaks, the disorder of the device is significantly higher than graphene devices without any SL. We use finite-element simulations combined with a resistor network model to calculate the effects of this disorder on the transport properties of graphene. We consider three types of disorder: nanohole size variations, adjacent nanohole mergers, and nanohole vacancies. Comparing our experimental results with the model, we find that the disorder primarily originates from nanohole size variations rather than nanohole mergers in square SLs. We further confirm the validity of our model by comparing the results with quantum transport simulations. Our findings highlight the applicability of our simple framework to predict and engineer disorder in patterned SLs, specifically correlating variations in the resultant SL patterns to the observed disorder. Our combined experimental and theoretical results could serve as a valuable guide for optimizing nanofabrication processes to engineer disorder in nanopatterned SLs.</description>

      <title>Magnonic Thermal Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a magnon-based thermal machine in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic insulators. The thermodynamical cycles are engineered by exposing a magnon spin system to thermal baths at different temperatures and tuning the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. We find for the Otto cycle that a thermal gas of magnons converts a fraction of heat into energy in the form of work, where the efficiency is maximized for specific values of DM, reaching the corresponding Carnot efficiency. We witness a positive to negative net work transition during the cycle that marks the onset of a refrigerator-like behavior. The work produced by the magnonic heat engine enhances the magnon chemical potential. The last enables a spin accumulation that might result in the pumping of spin currents at the interfaces of metal-magnet heterostructures. Our work opens new possibilities for the efficient leverage of conventional two-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of low-angle twisted bilayer graphene at three-quarters filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the magnetic properties exhibited by twisted bilayer graphene systems with small twist angles, where the appearance of flat minibands strongly enhances electron-electron interaction effects. We consider a tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with a Hubbard mean-field interaction term and employ a real-space recursion technique to self-consistently calculate the system's local density of states. The $O({\cal N})$ efficiency of the recursion method makes it possible to address superlattices of very large size by means of a full real-space analysis. Our procedure is validated by comparison with literature momentum-space calculations that find a magnetic phase in charge-neutral twisted bilayer graphene. We use our method to investigate the properties of small-angle twisted bilayer graphene at three-quarters filling of the conduction miniband. Our calculations indicate the emergence of a ferromagnetic phase that can be understood in terms of the Stoner mechanism, in line with recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Fractal spectrum in twisted bilayer optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The translation symmetry of a lattice is greatly modified when subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field [Zak, Phys. Rev. \textbf{134}, A1602 (1964)]. This change in symmetry can lead to magnetic unit cells that are substantially larger than the original ones. Similarly, the translation properties of a double-layered lattice alters drastically while two monolayers are relatively twisted by a small angle, resulting in large-scale moir\'{e} unit cells. Intrigued by the resemblance, we calculate the complete band structures of a twisted bilayer optical lattice and show that the geometric moir\'{e} effect can induce fractal band structures. The fractals are controlled by the twist angle between two monolayers and are closely connected to the celebrated butterfly spectrum of two-dimensional Bloch electrons in a magnetic field [Hofstadter, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{14}, 2239 (1976)]. We demonstrate this by proving that the twisted bilayer optical lattice can be mapped to a generalized Hofstadter's model with long-range hopping. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence on the infinite recursive structures of the spectrum and give an algorithm for computing these structures.</description>

      <title>Stability and noncentered PT symmetry of real topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real topological phases protected by the spacetime inversion (P T) symmetry are a current research focus. The basis is that the P T symmetry endows a real structure in momentum space, which leads to Z2 topological classifications in 1D and 2D. Here, we provide solutions to two outstanding problems in the diagnosis of real topology. First, based on the stable equivalence in K-theory, we clarify that the 2D topological invariant remains well defined in the presence of nontrivial 1D invariant, and we develop a general numerical approach for its evaluation, which was hitherto unavailable. Second, under the unit-cell convention, noncentered P T symmetries assume momentum dependence, which violates the presumption in previous methods for computing the topological invariants. We clarify the classifications for this case and formulate the invariants by introducing a twisted Wilson-loop operator for both 1D and 2D. A simple model on a rectangular lattice is constructed to demonstrate our theory, which can be readily realized using artificial crystals.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon interaction, magnetic phase transition, charge density waves and resistive switching in VS2 and VSe2 revealed by Yanson point contact spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VS2 and VSe2 have attracted particular attention among the transition metals dichalcogenides because of their promising physical properties concerning magnetic ordering, charge density wave (CDW), emergent superconductivity, etc., which are very sensitive to stoichiometry and dimensionality reduction. Yanson point contact (PC) spectroscopic study reveals metallic and nonmetallic states in VS2 PCs, as well as a magnetic phase transition was detected below 25 K. Analysis of PC spectra of VS2 testifies the realization of the thermal regime in PCs. At the same time, rare PC spectra, where the magnetic phase transition was not visible, shows a broad maximum of around 20 mV, likely connected with electron-phonon interaction (EPI). On the other hand, PC spectra of VSe2 demonstrate metallic behavior, which allowed us to detect features associated with EPI and CDW transition. The Kondo effect appeared for both compounds, apparently due to interlayer vanadium ions. Besides, the resistive switching was observed in PCs on VSe2 between a low resistive, mainly metallic-type state, and a high resistive nonmetallic-type state by applying bias voltage (about 0.4V). In contrast, reverse switching occurs by applying a voltage of opposite polarity (about 0.4V). The reason may be the alteration of stoichiometry in the PC core due to the displacement of V ions to interlayer under a high electric field. The observed resistive switching characterize VSe2 as a potential material, e.g., for non-volatile resistive RAM, neuromorphic engineering, and for other nanoelectronic applications. At the same time, VSe2 attracts attention as a rare layered van der Waals compound with magnetic transition.</description>

      <title>Topological insulators based on $p$-wave altermagnets, electrical control and detection of the altermagnetic domain wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional hybrid system made of a $p$-wave altermagnet and a metal possessing the orbital degree of freedom. The hybrid system is a topological insulator without the spin-orbit interaction. There emerge two edge states per one edge, because the system is mapped to a set of two copies of a topological insulator. Each copy resembles the long-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model but it is topologically different. Topological interface states emerge at a domain wall of the $p$-wave altermagnet, which are charged due to the Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism. Hence, the domain wall of the $p$-wave is controllable and detectable by purely electrical means.</description>

      <title>Superbunched radiation of a tunnel junction due to charge quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chaotic light source is characterized by the fact that many independent emitters radiate photons with a random optical phase. This is similar compared to a tunnel junction where many independent channels are able to emit photons due to a coupling to an electromagnetic environment. However, in a recent experiment it has been observed that a tunnel junction can deviate from the expectation of chaotic light and is able to emit strongly correlated, superbunched photons. Motivated by this, we study the correlation of the radiation and show that the superbunching originates from the emission of multiple photons which is possible due to the quantization of charge.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling induced topological phase transition in an $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ Haldane-Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present impelling evidence of topological phase transitions induced by electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling in an $\alpha$-$T_3$ Haldane-Holstein model that presents smooth tunability between graphene ($\alpha=0$) and a dice lattice $(\alpha=1)$. The e-ph coupling has been incorporated via the Lang-Firsov transformation which adequately captures the polaron physics in the high frequency (anti-adiabatic) regime, and yields an effective Hamiltonian of the system through zero phonon averaging at $T=0$. While exploring the signature of the phase transition driven by polaron and its interplay with the parameter $\alpha$, we identify two regions based on the values of $\alpha$, namely, the low to intermediate range $(0 &lt; \alpha \le 0.6)$ and larger values of $\alpha~(0.6 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1)$ where the topological transitions show distinct behaviour. There exists a single critical e-ph coupling strength for the former, below which the system behaves as a topological insulator characterized by edge modes, finite Chern number, and Hall conductivity, with all of them vanishing above this value, and the system undergoes a spectral gap closing transition. Further, the critical coupling strength depends upon $\alpha$. For the latter case $(0.6 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1)$, the scenario is more interesting where there are two critical values of the e-ph coupling at which trivial-topological-trivial and topological-topological-trivial phase transitions occur for $\alpha$ in the range $[0.6:1]$. Our studies on e-ph coupling induced phase transitions show a significant difference with regard to the well-known unique transition occurring at $\alpha = 0.5$ (or at $0.7$) in the absence of the e-ph coupling, and thus underscore the importance of interaction effects on the topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The magnetism measurements of the two-dimensional van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS4 using dynamic cantilever magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of van der Waals (vdWs) magnetic materials has sparked great interest in spintronics. However, conventional methods often face challenges in characterizing the magnetic properties of small-sized vdWs materials, especially for antiferromagnets with extremely small magnetic moments. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of dynamic cantilever magnetometry (DCM) in characterizing the magnetic properties of vdWs magnets, using an antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS4. We observe continuous spin axis rotation under a magnetic field, accurately modelled by considering the existance of marked magnetic anisotropies. Furthermore, the dominance of out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy in spin reorientation behavior at low temperatures transitions to the prevalence of in-plane anisotropy with increasing temperature, leading to a sign reversal of the frequency shift in measurements. The peculiar magnetic phase transitions make CrPS4 an intriguing platform for studying two-dimensional magnetism. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of DCM in characterizing magnetic anisotropies and phase transitions in vdWs magnets.</description>

      <title>Spin-resolved nonlocal transport in proximitized Rashba nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium transport in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanowires is crucial for many quantum phenomena such as generating entangled states via cross Andreev reflection (CAR) processes, detecting topological superconductivity, reading out Andreev spin qubits, coupling spin qubits over long distances and so on. Here, we investigate numerically transport properties of a proximitized Rashba nanowire that hosts spin-polarized low-energy quasiparticle states. We show that the spin polarization in such one-dimensional Andreev bands, extended over the entire nanowire length, can be detected in nonlocal transport measurements with tunnel-coupled side leads that are spin polarized. Remarkably, we find an exact correspondence between the sign of the nonlocal conductance and the spin density of the superconducting quasiparticles at the side lead position. We demonstrate that this feature is robust to moderate static disorder. As an example, we show that such a method can be used to detect spin inversion of the bands, accompanying the topological phase transition (TPT) for realistic system parameters. Furthermore, we show that such effects can be used to switch between CAR and elastic cotunneling (ECT) processes by tuning the strength of either the electric or the magnetic field. These findings hold significant practical implications for state-of-the-art transport experiments in such hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Large scale simulations of photosynthetic antenna systems: interplay of cooperativity and disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic antenna complexes containing more than one hundred thousands chlorophyll molecules, comparable with natural size, have been performed. Photosynthetic antenna complexes present in Green sulfur bacteria and Purple bacteria have been analyzed using a radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, well known in the field of quantum optics, instead of the widely used dipole-dipole Frenkel Hamiltonian. This approach allows to study ensembles of emitters beyond the small volume limit (system size much smaller than the absorbed wavelength), where the Frenkel Hamiltonian fails. When analyzed on a large scale, such structures display superradiant states much brighter then their single components. An analysis of the robustness to static disorder and dynamical (thermal) noise, shows that exciton coherence in the whole photosynthetic complex is larger than the coherence found in its parts. This provides evidence that the photosynthetic complex as a whole has a predominant role in sustaining coherences in the system even at room temperature. Our results allow a better understanding of natural photosynthetic antennae and could drive experiments to verify how the response to the electromagnetic radiation depends on the size of the photosynthetic antenna.</description>

      <title>On the average spin Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose the average spin Chern number (ASCN) as an indicator of the topological significance of the spin degree of freedom within insulating materials. Whenever this number is a non-zero even integer, it distinguishes the material as a spin Chern insulator and the number is a topological invariant. If this number is not zero, it indicates that the material has non-trivial spin transport properties, and it lies close to the value of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) within the bandgap. For materials where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is small, the ASCN matches the SHC. When the SOC cannot be neglected, both values are non-zero simultaneously. The ASCN is therefore a good complement for the intrinsic contribution of the SHC, and permits to detect topological information of the material which is not possible alone from the value of the SHC.</description>

      <title>Sub-microsecond high-fidelity dispersive readout of a spin qubit with squeezed photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and high-fidelity qubit measurement is essential for realizing quantum error correction, which is in turn a key ingredient to universal quantum computing. For electron spin qubits, fast readout is one of the significant road blocks toward error correction. Here we examine the dispersive readout of a single spin in a semiconductor double quantum dot coupled to a microwave resonator. We show that using displaced squeezed vacuum states for the probing photons can improve the qubit readout fidelity and speed. Under condition of proper phase matching, we find that a moderate, and only moderate, squeezing can enhance both the signal-to-noise ratio and the fidelity of the qubit-state readout, and the optimal readout time can be shortened to the sub-microsecond range with above $99\%$ fidelity. These enhancements are achieved at low probing microwave intensity, ensuring non-demolition qubit measurement.</description>

Abstract: The minority-spin Fe/MgO interface states are at the Fermi level in density functional theory (DFT), but experimental evidence and GW calculations place them slightly higher in energy. This small shift can strongly influence tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in junctions with a thin MgO barrier and its dependence on the concentration of Co in the electrodes. Here, an empirical potential correction to DFT is introduced to shift the interface states up to match the tunnel spectroscopy data. With this shift, TMR in Fe/MgO/Fe junctions exceeds 800% and 3000% at 3 and 4 monolayers (ML) of MgO, respectively. We further consider the effect of alloying of the Fe electrodes with up to 30% Co or 10% V, treating them in the coherent potential approximation (CPA). Alloying with Co broadens the interface states and brings a large incoherent minority-spin spectral weight to the Fermi level. Alloying with V brings the minority-spin resonant states close to the Fermi level. However, in both cases the minority-spin spectral weight at the Fermi level resides primarily at the periphery of the Brillouin zone, which is favorable for spin filtering. Using convolutions of $\mathbf{k}_\parallel$-resolved barrier densities of states calculated in CPA, it is found that TMR is strongly reduced by alloying with Co or V but still remains above 500% at 4 ML of MgO up to 30% of Co or 5% V. At 5 ML, the TMR increases above 1000% in all systems considered. On the other hand, while TMR declines sharply with increasing bias up to 0.2 eV in the MTJ with pure Fe leads, it remains almost constant up to 0.5 eV if leads are alloyed with Co.</description>

      <title>Ligand Equilibrium Influences Photoluminescence Blinking in CsPbBr3: A Change Point Analysis of Widefield Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08166</link>

Abstract: Photoluminescence intermittency remains one of the biggest challenges to realizing perovskite quantum dots (QDs) as scalable single photon emitters. We compare CsPbBr3 QDs capped with different ligands, lecithin, and a combination of oleic acid and oleylamine, to elucidate the role of surface chemistry on photoluminescence intermittency. We employ widefield photoluminescence microscopy, sampling the blinking behavior of hundreds of QDs. Using change point analysis, we achieve the robust classification of blinking trajectories, and we analyze representative distributions from large numbers of QDs (Nlecithin = 1308, Noleic acid/oleylamine =1317). We find that lecithin suppresses blinking in CsPbBr3 QDs compared to oleic acid/oleylamine. Under common experimental conditions, lecithin-capped QDs are 7.5 times more likely to be non-blinking and spend 2.5 times longer in their most emissive state, despite both QDs having nearly identical solution photoluminescence quantum yields. We measure photoluminescence as a function of dilution and show that the differences between lecithin and oleic acid/oleylamine capping emerge at low concentrations during preparation for single particle experiments. From experiment and first principles calculations, we attribute the differences in lecithin and oleic acid/oleylamine performance to differences in their ligand binding equilibria. Consistent with our experimental data, density functional theory calculations suggest a stronger binding affinity of lecithin to the QD surface compared to oleic acid/oleylamine, implying a reduced likelihood of ligand desorption during dilution. These results suggest that using more tightly binding ligands is a necessity for surface passivation and consequently, blinking reduction in perovskite QDs used for single particle and quantum light experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensor and the topological characterization of the extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum metric and topological Euler number in a cyclically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with long-range hopping terms. By computing the quantum geometry tensor, we derive exactly expressions for the quantum metric and Berry curvature of the energy band electrons, and we obtain the phase diagram of the model marked by the first Chern number. Furthermore, we also obtain the topological Euler number of the energy band based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem on the topological characterization of the closed Bloch states manifold in the first Brillouin zone. However, some regions where the Berry curvature is identically zero in the first Brillouin zone results in the degeneracy of the quantum metric, which leads to ill-defined non-integer topological Euler numbers. Nevertheless, the non-integer "Euler number" provides valuable insights and provide an upper bound for absolute values of the Chern numbers.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconducting diode effects via antisymmetry and antisymmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking plays a pivotal role in unlocking intriguing properties and functionalities in material systems. For example, the breaking of spatial and temporal symmetries leads to a fascinating phenomenon of superconducting diode effect. However, generating and precisely controlling the superconducting diode effect poses significant challenges. Here, we take a novel route with deliberate manipulation of magnetic charge potentials to realize unconventional superconducting flux-quantum diode effects. We achieve this through suitably tailored nanoengineered arrays of nanobar magnets on top of a superconducting thin film. We demonstrate the vital roles of inversion antisymmetry and its breaking in evoking unconventional superconducting effects-a magnetically symmetric diode effect and an odd-parity magnetotransport effect. These effects are non-volatilely controllable through in-situ magnetization switching of the nanobar magnets. Our findings promote the use of antisymmetry (breaking) for initiating unconventional superconducting properties, paving the way for exciting prospects and innovative functionalities in superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Selective-Area Epitaxy of Bulk-Insulating (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ Films and Nanowires by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selective-area epitaxy (SAE) is a useful technique to grow epitaxial films with a desired shape on a pre-patterned substrate. Although SAE of patterned topological-insulator (TI) thin films has been performed in the past, there has been no report of SAE-grown TI structures that are bulk-insulating. Here we report the successful growth of Hall-bars and nanowires of bulk-insulating TIs using the SAE technique. Their transport properties show that the quality of the selectively-grown structures is comparable to that of bulk-insulating TI films grown on pristine substrates. In SAE-grown TI nanowires, we were able to observe Aharonov-Bohm-like magnetoresistance oscillations that are characteristic of the quantum-confined topological surface states. The availability of bulk-insulating TI nanostructures via the SAE technique opens the possibility to fabricate intricate topological devices in a scalable manner.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid pase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized dc conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arise under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>

Abstract: Atomic-scale control of light-matter interactions represent the ultimate frontier for many applications in photonics and quantum technology. Two-dimensional semiconductors, including transition metal dichalcogenides, are a promising platform to achieve such control due to the combination of an atomically thin geometry and convenient photophysical properties. Here, we demonstrate that a variety of durable polymorphic structures can be combined to generate additional optical resonances beyond the standard excitons. We theoretically predict and experimentally show that atomic-sized patches of 1T phase within the 1H matrix form unique electronic bands that give rise to new and robust optical resonances with strong absorption, circularly polarized emission and long radiative lifetime. The atomic manipulation of two-dimensional semiconductors opens unexplored scenarios for light harvesting devices and exciton-based photonics.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile spin field effect transistor based on VSi2N4/Sc2CO2 multiferroic heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present first-principles calculations that introduce a novel nonvolatile spin field-effect transistor (Spin-FET) utilizing a van der Waals multiferroic heterostructure, specifically VSi2N4/Sc2CO2. We demonstrate that inverting the ferroelectric polarization in a Sc2CO2 monolayer can effectively modulate the electronic states of a VSi2N4 monolayer, enabling a transition from half-metal to half-semiconductor. This transition significantly alters the electronic transport properties. Furthermore, we construct a Spin-FET device based on this multiferroic heterostructure and observe that the VSi2N4/Sc2CO2-based Spin-FET exhibits exceptional all-electric-controlled performance. Notably, the inversion of the Sc2CO2 ferroelectric polarization yields a substantial on-off current ratio, approximately 650\%, under a minimal bias voltage of 0.02 V. Additionally, we identify a unique spatially-separated spin-polarized transport phenomenon, wherein pure spin-up electrons transport exclusively through VSi2N4, and spin-down electrons through Sc$_2$CO$_2$. Our findings suggest a promising pathway for developing low-energy-dissipation and nonvolatile FET devices.</description>

      <title>Solitons in binary compounds with stacked two-dimensional honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the electronic properties of thin films of binary compounds with stacked layers where each layer is a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with two atoms per unit cell. The two atoms per cell are assigned different onsite energies in order to consider six different stacking orders: ABC, ABA, AA, ABC$^{\prime}$, ABA$^{\prime}$, and AA$^{\prime}$. Using a minimal tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping, we consider whether a fault in the texture of onsite energies in the vertical, stacking direction supports localized states, and we find localized states within the bulk band gap for ABC, ABA, and AA$^{\prime}$ stacking. Depending on the stacking type, parameter values, and whether the soliton is atomically sharp or a smooth texture, there are a range of different band structures including soliton bands that are either isolated or that hybridize with other states, such as surface states, and soliton bands that are either dispersive or flat, the latter yielding narrow features in the density of states. We discuss the relevance of our results to specific materials including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and other binary compounds.</description>

      <title>Size-induced Exchange Bias in Single-phase CoO Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report exchange bias (EB) in single-phase CoO nanoparticles, where two magnetic phases naturally emerge as the crystallite size decreases from 34.6 to 10.8 nm. The N\'eel temperature (TN) associated with antiferromagnetic ordering decreases monotonically with the reduction in crystallite size, highlighting the significant influence of size effects. The 34.6 nm nanoparticles exhibit magnetization irreversibility between zero field cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) states below TN. This irreversibility appears well above TN with further reduction in size, resulting in the absence of true paramagnetic regime which indicates the occurrence of an additional magnetic phase. The frequency-dependent ac-susceptibility in 10.8 nm nanoparticles suggests slow dynamics of disordered surface spins above TN, coinciding with the establishment of long-range order in the core. The thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) and isothermoremanent magnetization (IRM) curves suggest a core-shell structure: the core is antiferromagnetic, and the shell consists of disordered surface spins causing ferromagnetic interaction. Hence, the exchange bias in these CoO nanoparticles results from the exchange coupling between an antiferromagnetic core and a disordered shell that exhibits unconventional surface spin characteristics.</description>

      <title>Preservation of scalar spin chirality across a metallic spacer in synthetic antiferromagnets with chiral interlayer interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral magnetic textures are highly attractive for the development of spintronic devices, due to their properties to store and transport information in an energy efficient manner. In multilayered systems, these are typically stabilized via the interfacial intralayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which leads to configurations with both vector and scalar spin chirality. Additionally, it has been recently observed that DMI may also promote interlayer vector spin chirality, coupling spins in different magnetic layers via non-magnetic spacer layers, an effect referred to as interlayer DMI (IL-DMI).
  Here, we present evidence of the preservation of interlayer scalar spin chirality across the non-magnetic metallic spacer of a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) with orthogonal anisotropy axes and IL-DMI. We draw this conclusion from a combined comprehensive experimental and computational study using scattering and imaging X-ray techniques. We find a direct relationship between the sign of the net out-of plane orientation of one of the layers, and the preferential in-plane vector spin chirality in the other layer after its demagnetization. Current IL-DMI models and other mechanisms which could potentially yield such chiral configurations fail in explaining these experimental results. This work thus uncovers a new flavor of chiral interlayer interactions, demanding the further development of theoretical models in order to describe the microscopic origin of the effect.</description>

      <title>Rotation of gap nodes in the topological superconductor Cu$_x$(PbSe)$_5$(Bi$_2$Se$_3$)$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the family of odd-parity topological superconductors derived from $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$, $\mathrm{Cu}_{x}(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ (CPSBS) has been elucidated to have gap nodes. Although the nodal gap structure has been established by specific-heat and thermal-conductivity measurements, there has been no direct observation of the superconducting gap of CPSBS using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS). Here we report the first STS experiments on CPSBS down to 0.35 K, which found that the vortices generated by out-of-plane magnetic fields have an elliptical shape, reflecting the anisotropic gap structure. The orientation of the gap minima is found to be aligned with the bulk direction when the surface lattice image shows twofold symmetry, but, surprisingly, it is rotated by 30$^{\circ}$ when twofold symmetry is absent. In addition, the superconducting gap spectra in zero magnetic field suggest that the gap nodes are most likely lifted. We argue that only an emergent symmetry at the surface, allowing for a linear superposition of gap functions with different symmetries in the bulk, can lead to the rotation of the gap nodes. The absence of inversion symmetry at the surface additionally lifts the nodes. This result establishes the subtle but crucial role of crystalline symmetry in topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Stability of Anomalous Hall Crystals in multilayer rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments showing an integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene have been interpreted in terms of a valley-polarized interaction-induced Chern band. The resulting many-body state can be viewed as an Anomalous Hall Crystal (AHC), with a further coupling to a weak moir\'e potential. We explain the origin of the Chern band and the corresponding AHC in the pentalayer system. To describe the competition between AHC and Wigner Crystal (WC) phases, we propose a simplified low-energy description that predicts the Hartree-Fock phase diagram to good accuracy. This theory can be fruitfully viewed as `superconducting ring' in momentum space, where the emergence of Chern number is analogous to the flux quantization in a Little-Parks experiment. We discuss the possible role of the moir\'e potential, and emphasize that even if in the moir\'e-less limit, the AHC is not favored (beyond Hartree-Fock) over a correlated Fermi liquid, the moir\'e potential will push the system into a `moir\'e-enabled AHC'. We also suggest that there is a range of alignment angles between R5G and hBN where a $C = 2$ insulator may be found at integer filling.</description>
