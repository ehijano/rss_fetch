      <title>Achieving Gender Representation in Lead-Author Publications in the ASTRO3D Centre of Excellence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the publication rates of 400 research-focused members in the ASTRO3D Centre of Excellence by gender, project, and year from January 2018 to January 2024 (six years). Of the 443 refereed publications led by ASTRO3D members, women were first-author on 38% which is nearly double that of the astronomy field in the same period (~20%). We record a high-water mark in 2022: 46% of ASTRO3D publications were led by females and 45% of research members identified as female. Using the nine research projects in ASTRO3D, we show that the combination of female leadership and higher fraction of female members correlates with a higher fraction of female-led publications. We find no correlation between the fraction of female-led publications and project size. Our findings demonstrate that gender representation in refereed publications can be achieved within ~5 years by combining evidence-based recruitment strategies with representation in supervisors and collaborations. We recommend that strategies for improving STEM participation focus on both female leadership and female representation to maximize effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Towards the Safety-Relevant Dimension of Driver Behaviour: A Dual-State Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make a methodological contribution by introducing a new dimension of traffic conflict severity: the probability that a driver is in a defensive state. This behavioural probability reflects an internal response to perceived risk and is estimated using a latent class Discrete Choice Model (DCM) that captures driver behaviour as a probabilistic mixture of two latent driving states: a defensive state, representing heightened caution and collision-avoidance intentions under perceived risk, and a neutral state, reflecting routine driving behaviour under low-threat conditions. The framework is grounded in psychological theory, particularly the triad of affect, behaviour, and cognition. It is also informed by two key concepts. First, that event severity exists on a continuum, rather than being confined to binary categories of safe or unsafe. Second, that drivers perceive risk through a dynamic spatial safety field, one that varies with direction, proximity, and the motion of surrounding road users. Applied to the publicly available rounD dataset, the framework yields interpretable estimates of state membership probabilities. The defensive state consistently reflects stronger sensitivity to spatial and temporal risk, while the neutral state captures context-appropriate yet less reactive driving patterns. Importantly, the paper also proposes a method to assess the quality of the estimated probability of being in a defensive state. Because of the duality between the defensive and neutral states, evaluating the consistency of one offers insights into the reliability of the other. To explore this, a multi-step validation procedure is applied across five data subsets representing different driving contexts, including free-flow and diverging scenarios, to examine how well the neutral state generalises beyond the estimation sample.</description>

      <title>A bibliometric study on mathematical oncology: interdisciplinarity, internationality, collaboration and trending topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical oncology is an interdisciplinary research field where mathematics meets cancer research. The field's intention to study cancer makes it dynamic, as practicing researchers are incentivised to quickly adapt to both technical and medical research advances. Determining the scope of mathematical oncology is therefore not straightforward; however, it is important for purposes related to funding allocation, education, scientific communication, and community organisation. To address this issue, we here conduct a bibliometric analysis of mathematical oncology. We compare our results to the broader field of mathematical biology, and position our findings within theoretical science of science frameworks.
  Based on article metadata and citation flows, our results provide evidence that mathematical oncology has undergone a significant evolution since the 1960s marked by increased interactions with other disciplines, geographical expansion, larger research teams, and greater diversity in studied topics. The latter finding contributes to the greater discussion on which models different research communities consider to be valuable in the era of big data and machine learning. Further, the results presented in this study quantitatively motivate that international collaboration networks should be supported to enable new countries to enter and remain in the field, and that mathematical oncology benefits both mathematics and the life sciences.</description>

      <title>The Devil's Dung? Money as a mechanism of generalized reciprocity in human societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: St. Francis of Assisi (1181/82-1226) famously called money the devil's dung, and indeed money is often associated with greed, inequality, and corruption. Drawing on Nowak's five rules for the evolution of cooperation, we argue here that money promotes the formation of circuits of generalized reciprocity across human groups that are fundamental to social evolution. In an evolutionary tournament, we show that money exchange is an evolutionary stable strategy that promotes cooperation without relying on the cognitive demands of direct reciprocity or reputation mechanisms. However, we also find that excessive liquidity can be detrimental because it can distort the informational value of money as a signal of past cooperation, making defection more profitable. Our results suggest that, in addition to institutions that promoted trust and punishment, the emergence of institutions that regulated the money supply was key to maintaining generalized reciprocity within and across human groups.</description>

      <title>Modeling Income Distribution with the Gause-Witt Population Ecology System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an empirical application of the Gause-Witt model of population ecology and ecosystems to the income distribution competitive dynamics of social classes in economic systems. The Gause-Witt mathematical system of coupled nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equations employed to model population of species sharing the same ecological niche and competing for the same resources was applied to the income data of Brazil. Previous studies using Brazilian income data from 1981 to 2009 showed that the complementary cumulative distribution functions built from yearly datasets have two distinct segments: the lower income region comprising of about 99% of the population can be represented by the Gompertz curve, whereas the richest 1% is described by the Pareto power-law. The results of applying the Gause-Witt system to Brazilian income data in order to describe the distributive competition dynamics of these two population shares indicate that the 99% and 1% income classes are mostly in the dynamic state of stable coexistence.</description>

      <title>Ambiguities, Built-in Biases and Flaws in Big Data Insight Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I address the challenge of extracting reliable insights from large datasets using a simplified model that illustrates how hierarchical classification can distort outcomes. The model consists of discrete pixels labeled red, blue, or white. Red and blue indicate distinct properties, and white represents unclassified or ambiguous data. A macro-color is assigned only if one color holds a strict majority among the pixels. Otherwise, the aggregate is labeled white, reflecting uncertainty. This setup mimics a percolation threshold at fifty percent. Assuming direct access of the various proportions of colors is infeasible from the data, I implement a hierarchical coarse-graining procedure. Elements (first pixels, then aggregates) are recursively grouped and reclassified via local majority rules, producing ultimately a single super-aggregate whose color represents the inferred macro-property of the collection of pixels as a whole. Analytical results, supported by simulations, show that the process introduces additional white aggregates beyond white pixels, which could be initially present. These arise from groups lacking a clear majority, requiring arbitrary symmetry-breaking decisions to attribute a color to them. While each local resolution may appear minor and inconsequential, their repetitions introduce a growing systematic bias. Even with complete data, unavoidable asymmetries in local rules are shown to skew outcomes. This study highlights a critical limitation of recursive data reduction. Insight extraction is shaped not only by data quality, but by how local ambiguity is handled. That results in built-in biases. Thus, the related flaws are not due to the data, but due to structural choices made during local aggregations. Though based on a simple model, the findings expose the high likelihood of inherent flaws in widely used hierarchical classification techniques.</description>

      <title>Evolution and determinants of firm-level systemic risk in local production networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have exposed vulnerabilities and caused disruptions of supply chains, leading to product shortages, increased costs, and economic instability. This has prompted increasing efforts to assess systemic risk, namely the effects of firm disruptions on entire economies. However, the ability of firms to react to crises by rewiring their supply links has been largely overlooked, limiting our understanding of production networks resilience. Here we study dynamics and determinants of firm-level systemic risk in the Hungarian production network from 2015 to 2022. We use as benchmark a heuristic maximum entropy null model that generates an ensemble of production networks at equilibrium, by preserving the total input (demand) and output (supply) of each firm at the sector level. We show that the fairly stable set of firms with highest systemic risk undergoes a structural change during COVID-19, as those enabling economic exchanges become key players in the economy -- a result which is not reproduced by the null model. Although the empirical systemic risk aligns well with the null value until the onset of the pandemic, it becomes significantly smaller afterwards as the adaptive behavior of firms leads to a more resilient economy. Furthermore, firms' international trade volume (being a subject of disruption) becomes a significant predictor of their systemic risk. However, international links cannot provide an unequivocal explanation for the observed trends, as imports and exports have opposing effects on local systemic risk through the supply and demand channels.</description>

      <title>One Giant Leap for Womankind: First Menstrual Cups Tested in Space Flight Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early days of space exploration, when Sally Ride was offered 100 tampons for a week-long mission, menstrual medical devices first began to be used in space conditions. Since then, hormonal menstrual suppression has become the preferred method for managing menstruation in space, offering significant advantages. However, this is not an option for astronauts who choose to menstruate. The lack of sustainable menstrual technologies will pose challenges for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars, where astronauts may spend years in space. The AstroCup mission represents the first effort to test menstrual cups in spaceflight, evaluating their durability and functionality. Through material integrity tests and functional assessments using a rheological analogue of human blood, we demonstrate the resilience of menstrual cups and discuss their implications for sustainable menstrual management in future lunar and Martian missions.</description>

      <title>The State of Papers, Retractions, and Preprints: Evidence from the CrossRef Database (2004-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 20-year analysis of CrossRef metadata demonstrates that global scholarly output -- encompassing publications, retractions, and preprints -- exhibits strikingly inertial growth, well-described by exponential, quadratic, and logistic models with nearly indistinguishable goodness-of-fit. Retraction dynamics, in particular, remain stable and minimally affected by the COVID-19 shock, which contributed less than 1% to total notices. Since 2004, publications doubled every 9.8 years, retractions every 11.4 years, and preprints at the fastest rate, every 5.6 years. The findings underscore a system primed for ongoing stress at unchanged structural bottlenecks. Although model forecasts diverge beyond 2024, the evidence suggests that the future trajectory of scholarly communication will be determined by persistent systemic inertia rather than episodic disruptions -- unless intentionally redirected by policy or AI-driven reform.</description>

      <title>Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap -- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent architectural component.</description>

      <title>Evolution of boundedly rational learning in games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People make strategic decisions multiple times a day. We act strategically in negotiations, when we coordinate our actions with others, or when we choose with whom to cooperate. The resulting dynamics can be studied with evolutionary game theory. This framework explores how people adapt their decisions over time, in light of how effective their strategies have proven to be. A crucial quantity in respective models is the strength of selection. This quantity regulates how likely individuals switch to a better strategy when given the choice. The larger the selection strength, the more biased is the learning process in favor of strategies with large payoffs. Therefore, this quantity is often interpreted as a measure of rationality. Traditionally, most models take selection strength to be a fixed parameter. Instead, here we allow the individuals' strategies and their selection strength to co-evolve. The endpoints of this co-evolutionary process depend on the strategic interaction in place. In many prisoner's dilemmas, selection strength increases indefinitely, as one may expect. However, in snowdrift or stag-hunt games, it can either converge to a finite value, or we observe evolutionary branching altogether - such that different individuals arrive at different selection strengths. Overall, this work sheds light on how evolution might shape learning mechanisms for social behavior. It suggests that boundedly rational learning is not only a by-product of cognitive constraints. Instead it might also evolve as a means to gain strategic advantages.</description>

      <title>Contrail, or not contrail, that is the question: the "feasibility" of climate-optimal routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The environmental impact of aviation has been a focus of significant research for several decades. While there is a broad consensus among stakeholders on reducing carbon emissions, leading to efforts to improve route efficiency in air traffic management, the impact of non-carbon emissions like contrails has sparked a different debate. Some organizations have already moved to pre-operational trials for contrail avoidance through flight re-routing, with recent industry projects fast-tracking these operational strategies.
  This paper addresses the practical challenges of implementing contrail-aware routing. Building on our previous research, which enables the generation of wind-optimal 4D trajectories using grid-like cost functions, we utilize the TOP tool and the OpenAP aircraft performance model to analyze the trade-offs between fuel consumption and contrail avoidance. We also examine the impact of weather forecast uncertainty on contrail mitigation, the effects on airspace capacity and network operations, and the implications for aviation regulatory frameworks.
  To investigate these challenges, we reconstructed a dataset from OpenSky data, encompassing all flight trajectories over Europe on a day with significant contrail potential. Our data-driven analysis highlights the potential difficulties in implementing contrail-optimal routing in practice, particularly concerning uncertainties in weather forecasts, impacts on airspace capacity, and questions of responsibility for optimal routing.
  Overall, we argue that contrail-optimal routing should be approached with caution, as its implementation may not be as straightforward as some stakeholders suggest.</description>

      <title>Triadic Novelty: A Typology and Measurement Framework for Recognizing Novel Contributions in Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific progress depends on novel ideas, but current reward systems often fail to recognize them. Many existing metrics conflate novelty with popularity, privileging ideas that fit existing paradigms over those that challenge them. This study develops a theory-driven framework to better understand how different types of novelty emerge, take hold, and receive recognition. Drawing on network science and theories of discovery, we introduce a triadic typology: Pioneers, who introduce entirely new topics; Mavericks, who recombine distant concepts; and Vanguards, who reinforce weak but promising connections. We apply this typology to a dataset of 41,623 articles in the interdisciplinary field of philanthropy and nonprofit studies, linking novelty types to five-year citation counts using mixed-effects negative binomial regression. Results show that novelty is not uniformly rewarded. Pioneer efforts are foundational but often overlooked. Maverick novelty shows consistent citation benefits, particularly rewarded when it displaces prior focus. Vanguard novelty is more likely to gain recognition when it strengthens weakly connected topics, but its citation advantage diminishes as those reinforced nodes become more central. To enable fair comparison across time and domains, we introduce a simulated baseline model. These findings improve the evaluation of innovations, affecting science policy, funding, and institutional assessment practices.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how age-specific social contact patterns and susceptibility influence infectious disease transmission is crucial for accurate epidemic modeling. This study presents an eigenvector-based sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the impact of age-structured interactions on disease spread. By applying perturbation analysis to the Next Generation Matrix, we reformulate the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, as a generalized eigenproblem, enabling the identification of key age group interactions that drive transmission. Using real-world COVID-19 contact data from Hungary, we demonstrate the framework's ability to highlight critical transmission pathways. We compare these findings with results obtained earlier using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we extend the analysis to contact structures in the UK and British Columbia, Canada, providing broader epidemiological insights. This work enhances our understanding of demographic interactions in epidemic propagation and offers a robust methodological foundation for improving infectious disease modeling and informing public health interventions.</description>

      <title>The role of preprints in open science: Accelerating knowledge transfer from science to technology</title>

Abstract: Preprints have become increasingly essential in the landscape of open science, facilitating not only the exchange of knowledge within the scientific community but also bridging the gap between science and technology. However, the impact of preprints on technological innovation, given their unreviewed nature, remains unclear. This study fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive scientometric analysis of patent citations to bioRxiv preprints submitted between 2013 and 2021, measuring and accessing the contribution of preprints in accelerating knowledge transfer from science to technology. Our findings reveal a growing trend of patent citations to bioRxiv preprints, with a notable surge in 2020, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Preprints play a critical role in accelerating innovation, not only expedite the dissemination of scientific knowledge into technological innovation but also enhance the visibility of early research results in the patenting process, while journals remain essential for academic rigor and reliability. The substantial number of post-online-publication patent citations highlights the critical role of the open science model-particularly the "open access" effect of preprints-in amplifying the impact of science on technological innovation. This study provides empirical evidence that open science policies encouraging the early sharing of research outputs, such as preprints, contribute to more efficient linkage between science and technology, suggesting an acceleration in the pace of innovation, higher innovation quality, and economic benefits.</description>
