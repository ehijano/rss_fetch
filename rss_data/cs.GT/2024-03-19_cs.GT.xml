      <title>MAC Advice for Facility Location Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms with predictions have attracted much attention in the last years across various domains, including variants of facility location, as a way to surpass traditional worst-case analyses. We study the $k$-facility location mechanism design problem, where the $n$ agents are strategic and might misreport their location.
  Unlike previous models, where predictions are for the $k$ optimal facility locations, we receive $n$ predictions for the locations of each of the agents. However, these predictions are only "mostly" and "approximately" correct (or MAC for short) -- i.e., some $\delta$-fraction of the predicted locations are allowed to be arbitrarily incorrect, and the remainder of the predictions are allowed to be correct up to an $\varepsilon$-error. We make no assumption on the independence of the errors. Can such predictions allow us to beat the current best bounds for strategyproof facility location?
  We show that the $1$-median (geometric median) of a set of points is naturally robust under corruptions, which leads to an algorithm for single-facility location with MAC predictions. We extend the robustness result to a "balanced" variant of the $k$ facilities case. Without balancedness, we show that robustness completely breaks down, even for the setting of $k=2$ facilities on a line. For this "unbalanced" setting, we devise a truthful random mechanism that outperforms the best known result of Lu et al. [2010], which does not use predictions. En route, we introduce the problem of "second" facility location (when the first facility's location is already fixed). Our findings on the robustness of the $1$-median and more generally $k$-medians may be of independent interest, as quantitative versions of classic breakdown-point results in robust statistics.</description>

      <title>Information Compression in Dynamic Information Disclosure Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-player dynamic information design problem between a principal and a receiver -- a game is played between the two agents on top of a Markovian system controlled by the receiver's actions, where the principal obtains and strategically shares some information about the underlying system with the receiver in order to influence their actions. In our setting, both players have long-term objectives, and the principal sequentially commits to their strategies instead of committing at the beginning. Further, the principal cannot directly observe the system state, but at every turn they can choose randomized experiments to observe the system partially. The principal can share details about the experiments to the receiver. For our analysis we impose the truthful disclosure rule: the principal is required to truthfully announce the details and the result of each experiment to the receiver immediately after the experiment result is revealed. Based on the received information, the receiver takes an action when its their turn, with the action influencing the state of the underlying system. We show that there exist Perfect Bayesian equilibria in this game where both agents play Canonical Belief Based (CBB) strategies using a compressed version of their information, rather than full information, to choose experiments (for the principal) or actions (for the receiver). We also provide a backward inductive procedure to solve for an equilibrium in CBB strategies.</description>

      <title>Freshness-aware Block Propagation Optimization in 6G-based Web 3.0: An Evolutionary Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the aspiration to establish a decentralized digital economy, Web 3.0 is emerging as the fundamental technology for digital transformation. Incorporating the promising sixth-generation (6G) technology with large bandwidth and space-air-ground integrated coverage, 6G-based Web 3.0 holds great potential in empowering users with enhanced data control and facilitating secure peer-to-peer transactions, especially in consumer electronics, through the utilization of blockchain technologies. However, 6G-based Web 3.0 is still in its infancy, such as ensuring block freshness and optimizing block propagation to improve blockchain performance. In this paper, we develop a freshness-aware block propagation optimization framework for 6G-based Web 3.0. We first propose a novel metric called Age of Block Information (AoBI) based on the concept of age of information to quantify block freshness. To make block propagation optimization tractable, we classify miners into five different states and propose a block propagation model for public blockchains inspired by epidemic models. Moreover, considering that the miners are bounded rational, we propose an incentive mechanism based on the evolutionary game for block propagation to improve block propagation efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with other block propagation mechanisms, the proposed scheme has a higher block forwarding probability, which improves block propagation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Fragile Stable Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how fragile stable matchings are in a decentralized one-to-one matching setting. The classical work of Roth and Vande Vate (1990) suggests simple decentralized dynamics in which randomly-chosen blocking pairs match successively. Such decentralized interactions guarantee convergence to a stable matching. Our first theorem shows that, under mild conditions, any unstable matching -- including a small perturbation of a stable matching -- can culminate in any stable matching through these dynamics. Our second theorem highlights another aspect of fragility: stabilization may take a long time. Even in markets with a unique stable matching, where the dynamics always converge to the same matching, decentralized interactions can require an exponentially long duration to converge. A small perturbation of a stable matching may lead the market away from stability and involve a sizable proportion of mismatched participants for extended periods. Our results hold for a broad class of dynamics.</description>

      <title>PackIt! Gamified Rectangle Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze PackIt!, a turn-based game consisting of packing rectangles on an $n \times n$ grid. PackIt! can be easily played on paper, either as a competitive two-player game or in \emph{solitaire} fashion. On the $t$-th turn, a rectangle of area $t$ or $t+1$ must be placed in the grid. In the two-player format of PackIt! whichever player places a rectangle last wins, whereas the goal in the solitaire variant is to perfectly pack the $n \times n$ grid. We analyze conditions for the existence of a perfect packing over $n \times n$, then present an automated reasoning approach that allows finding perfect games of PackIt! up to $n = 50$ which includes a novel SAT-encoding technique of independent interest, and conclude by proving an NP-hardness result.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Throughput and Availability: Applications to prophet inequalities &amp; transaction fee mechanism design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the fundamental limits of availability and throughput for independent and heterogeneous demands of a limited resource. Availability is the probability that the demands are below the capacity of the resource. Throughput is the expected fraction of the resource that is utilized by the demands. We offer a concentration inequality generator that gives lower bounds on feasible availability and throughput pairs with a given capacity and independent but not necessarily identical distributions of up-to-unit demands. We show that availability and throughput cannot both be poor. These bounds are analogous to tail inequalities on sums of independent random variables, but hold throughout the support of the demand distribution. This analysis gives analytically tractable bounds supporting the unit-demand characterization of Chawla, Devanur, and Lykouris (2023) and generalizes to up-to-unit demands. Our bounds also provide an approach towards improved multi-unit prophet inequalities (Hajiaghayi, Kleinberg, and Sandholm, 2007). They have applications to transaction fee mechanism design (for blockchains) where high availability limits the probability of profitable user-miner coalitions (Chung and Shi, 2023).</description>

      <title>One-Shot Strategic Classification Under Unknown Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of strategic classification is to learn decision rules which are robust to strategic input manipulation. Earlier works assume that these responses are known; while some recent works handle unknown responses, they exclusively study online settings with repeated model deployments. But there are many domains$\unicode{x2014}$particularly in public policy, a common motivating use case$\unicode{x2014}$where multiple deployments are infeasible, or where even one bad round is unacceptable. To address this gap, we initiate the formal study of one-shot strategic classification under unknown responses, which requires committing to a single classifier once. Focusing on uncertainty in the users' cost function, we begin by proving that for a broad class of costs, even a small mis-estimation of the true cost can entail trivial accuracy in the worst case. In light of this, we frame the task as a minimax problem, with the goal of identifying the classifier with the smallest worst-case risk over an uncertainty set of possible costs. We design efficient algorithms for both the full-batch and stochastic settings, which we prove converge (offline) to the minimax solution at the dimension-independent rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. Our theoretical analysis reveals important structure stemming from strategic responses, particularly the value of dual norm regularization with respect to the cost function.</description>
