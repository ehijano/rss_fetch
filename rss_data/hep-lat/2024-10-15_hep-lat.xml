      <title>Grassmann tensor renormalization group approach to $(1+1)$-dimensional two-color lattice QCD at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Grassmann tensor network representing the partition function of (1+1)-dimensional two-color QCD with staggered fermions. The Grassmann path integral is rewritten as the trace of a Grassmann tensor network by introducing two-component auxiliary Grassmann fields on every edge of the lattice. We introduce an efficient initial tensor compression scheme to reduce the size of initial tensors. The Grassmann bond-weighted tensor renormalization group approach is adopted to evaluate the quark number density, fermion condensate, and diquark condensate at different gauge couplings as a function of the chemical potential. Different transition behavior is observed as the quark mass is varied. We discuss the efficiency of our initial tensor compression scheme and the future application toward the corresponding higher-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the $S$-wave and $P$-wave $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts using twisted boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of a lattice study of the $S$-wave and $P$-wave $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts using L\"uscher's method under the twisted boundary conditions to investigate the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}^+$ observed by the LHCb collaboration. Although the scattering phase shift at zero momentum gives information about the number of bound states according to Levinson's theorem, L\"uscher's method under the periodic boundary condition only accesses the scattering phase shifts at some discrete momenta and is not suitable for watching the signal of bound state formation. On the other hand, the twisted boundary condition has the advantage that the scattering phase shift at any momentum can be calculated and that not only the $S$-wave scattering phase shift but also the $P$-wave scattering phase shift can be obtained simultaneously. In this study, we perform the simulation for the $DD^*$ and $BB^*$ systems in the $I=0$ channel using 2+1 flavor PACS-CS gauge ensembles simulated at $m_\pi=295$ and 411 $\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Approaches to the Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical continuation of correlation functions from imaginary to real time is a crucial step in lattice gauge theories, and it challenges our ability to derive non-perturbative predictions from lattice simulations. We review aspects of this "inverse problem", which has driven both theoretical and algorithmic advancements in recent years, opening new promising avenues for non-perturbative studies of the Standard Model and beyond. The focus of this proceeding will be on variations of Backus-Gilbert and Bayesian methods.</description>

      <title>Correlations and fluctuations in a magnetized PNJL model with and without inverse magnetic catalysis effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$ and quadratic fluctuations $\chi^B_2,\ \chi^Q_2,\ \chi^T_2$ of baryon number $B$, electric charge $Q$ and temperature $T$ are investigated in a two-flavor Polyakov loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model at finite temperature and magnetic field. The inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect is introduced through the magnetic field dependent parameters $G(eB)$ or $T_0(eB)$, and we make comparison of the results in the cases with and without IMC effect. With nonvanishing magnetic field, the correlation $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$ and fluctuations $\chi^B_2,\ \chi^Q_2,\ \chi^T_2$ increase with temperature, and then show the peak around the pseudocritical temperatures of chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions in the cases with and without the IMC effect. The correlation and fluctuations along the phase transition line under external magnetic field are characterized by the scaled correlation ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ}=\frac{\chi_{11}^{BQ}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_{11}^{BQ}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ and scaled fluctuations ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{B(Q,T)}=\frac{\chi_2^{B(Q,T)}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_2^{B(Q,T)}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ at the pseudocritical temperature $T_{pc}^c$ of chiral restoration phase transition. ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ},\ {\hat {\chi}}_2^{B}$, and ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{Q}$ increase with magnetic fields, and the inclusion of IMC effect leads to some enhancement in their values. However, ${\hat {\chi}}_2^{T}$ is altered by the IMC effect. Without IMC effect, ${\hat \chi}^T_2$ slightly increases and then decreases with magnetic fields. Taking into account of the IMC effect by $G(eB)$, ${\hat \chi}^T_2$ monotonically increases with magnetic fields, and by $T_0(eB)$, it is a nonmonotonic function of magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD estimates of thermal photon production from the QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal photons produced in heavy-ion collision experiments are an important observable for understanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The thermal photon rate from the QGP at a given temperature can be calculated from the spectral function of the vector current correlator. Extraction of the spectral function from the lattice correlator is known to be an ill-conditioned problem, as there is no unique solution for a spectral function for a given lattice correlator with statistical errors. The vector current correlator, on the other hand, receives a large ultraviolet contribution from the vacuum, which makes the extraction of the thermal photon rate difficult from this channel. We therefore consider the difference between the transverse and longitudinal part of the spectral function, only capturing the thermal contribution to the current correlator, simplifying the reconstruction significantly. The lattice correlator is calculated for light quarks in quenched QCD at $T=470~$MeV ($\sim 1.5\, T_c$), as well as in 2+1 flavor QCD at $T=220~$MeV ($\sim 1.2 \, T_{pc}$) with $m_{\pi}=320$ MeV. In order to quantify the non-perturbative effects, the lattice correlator is compared with the corresponding $\text{NLO}+\text{LPM}^{\text{LO}}$ estimate of correlator. The reconstruction of the spectral function is performed in several different frameworks, ranging from physics-informed models of the spectral function to more general models in the Backus-Gilbert method and Gaussian Process regression. We find that the resulting photon rates agree within errors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the pion and meson dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the recent MIT lattice QCD data for the pion's gravitational form factors are, in the covered momentum transfer range, fully consistent with the meson dominance principle. In particular, the $2^{++}$ component can be accurately saturated with the $f_2(1270)$ meson, whereas the $0^{++}$ component with the $\sigma$ meson. To incorporate the large width of the $\sigma$, we use the dispersion relation with the spectral density obtained from analyses of the physical pion scattering data. Effects of the pion mass are estimated within Chiral Perturbation Theory and are found to be small between the lattice and the physical point. We also discuss the implications of the perturbative QCD constraints at high momentum transfers, leading to specific sum rules for the spectral densities of the gravitational form factors, and argue that these densities cannot be of definite sign.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar and vector tetraquarks $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar and vector four-quark states $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ are studied in the context of the QCD sum rule method. We model $T_{\mathrm{ \ PS}} $ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ as structures built of diquarks $ b^{T}C\gamma_{5}b$, $\overline{c}C\overline{c}^{T}$ and $b^{T}C\gamma _{5}b$ , $\overline{c}C\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\overline{c}^{T}$, respectively, with $ C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The spectroscopic parameters of the tetraquarks $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$, i.e., their masses and current couplings are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. We evaluate the full widths of $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ by taking into account their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the pseudoscalar particle they are processes $T_{\mathrm{PS}} \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{3}P_{0})$ and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. The vector state $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ can dissociate to meson pairs $2 B_{c}^{-}$, $2 B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. Partial widths of these decays are determined by the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices, which evaluated in the context of the three-point sum rule approach. Predictions obtained for the mass and full width of the pseudoscalar $m =(13.092\pm 0.095)~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma _{\mathrm{PS} }=(63.7\pm 13.0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and vector $\widetilde{m} =(13.15\pm 0.10)~ \mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{V}}=(53.5\pm 10.3)~\mathrm{MeV}$ tetraquarks can be useful for analyses of different four-quark resonances.</description>

      <title>Effects of Final State Interactions on Landau Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In certain kinematic and particle mass configurations, triangle singularities may lead to line-shapes which mimic the effects of resonances. This well-known effect is scrutinized here in the presence of final-state rescattering. The goal is achieved first by utilizing general arguments provided by Landau equations, and second by applying a modern scattering formalism with explicit two- and three-body unitarity.</description>
