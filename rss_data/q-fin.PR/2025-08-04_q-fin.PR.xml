      <title>Asian options for local-stochastic volatility models in the short-maturity regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the short-maturity asymptotics for Asian option prices in local-stochastic volatility (LSV) models. Both out-of-the-money (OTM) and at-the-money (ATM) asymptotics are considered. Using large deviations theory methods, the asymptotics for the OTM options are expressed as a rate function which is represented as a two-dimensional variational problem. We develop a novel expansion method for the variational problem by expanding the rate function around the ATM point. In particular, we derive series expansions in log-moneyness for the solution of this variational problem around the ATM point, and obtain explicit results for the first three terms. We give the ATM volatility level, skew and convexity of the implied volatility of an Asian option in a general local-stochastic volatility model, which can be used as an approximation for pricing Asian options with strikes sufficiently close to the ATM point. Using numerical simulations in the SABR, Heston and an LSV model with bounded local volatility, we show good performance of the asymptotic result for Asian options with sufficiently small maturity.</description>

      <title>VIX options in the SABR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the pricing of VIX options in the SABR model $dS_t = \sigma_t S_t^\beta dB_t, d\sigma_t = \omega \sigma_t dZ_t$ where $B_t,Z_t$ are standard Brownian motions correlated with correlation $\rho&lt;0$ and $0 \leq \beta &lt; 1$. VIX is expressed as a risk-neutral conditional expectation of an integral over the volatility process $v_t = S_t^{\beta-1} \sigma_t$. We show that $v_t$ is the unique solution to a one-dimensional diffusion process. Using the Feller test, we show that $v_t$ explodes in finite time with non-zero probability. As a consequence, VIX futures and VIX call prices are infinite, and VIX put prices are zero for any maturity. As a remedy, we propose a capped volatility process by capping the drift and diffusion terms in the $v_{t}$ process such that it becomes non-explosive and well-behaved, and study the short-maturity asymptotics for the pricing of VIX options.</description>
