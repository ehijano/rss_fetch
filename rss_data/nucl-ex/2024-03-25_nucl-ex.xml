      <title>Two-particle Bose-Einstein correlations and their Levy parameters in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these proceedings we discuss the measurement of Bose-Einstein momentum correlation function of pairs of charged hadrons in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV. We describe the measured correlations with correlation functions derived from Levy type source distributions. Using a transverse momentum and centrality binning, we extract the correlation strength parameter lambda, Levy index alpha and Levy scale parameter R as a function of pair transverse mass mT, for various centralities.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of flow vector decorrelation in $\mathbf{\sqrt{\textit{s}_{_{\bf NN}}}=5.02}$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the $p_{\rm T}$-dependent flow vector fluctuations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02~\mathrm{TeV}$ using azimuthal correlations with the ALICE experiment at the LHC are presented. A four-particle correlation approach [1] is used to quantify the effects of flow angle and magnitude fluctuations separately. This paper extends previous studies to additional centrality intervals and provides measurements of the $p_{\rm T}$-dependent flow vector fluctuations at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02~\mathrm{TeV}$ with two-particle correlations. Significant $p_{\rm T}$-dependent fluctuations of the $\vec{V}_{2}$ flow vector in Pb-Pb collisions are found across different centrality ranges, with the largest fluctuations of up to $\sim$15% being present in the 5% most central collisions. In parallel, no evidence of significant $p_{\rm T}$-dependent fluctuations of $\vec{V}_{3}$ or $\vec{V}_{4}$ is found. Additionally, evidence of flow angle and magnitude fluctuations is observed with more than $5\sigma$ significance in central collisions. These observations in Pb-Pb collisions indicate where the classical picture of hydrodynamic modeling with a common symmetry plane breaks down. This has implications for hard probes at high $p_{\rm T}$, which might be biased by $p_{\rm T}$-dependent flow angle fluctuations of at least 23% in central collisions. Given the presented results, existing theoretical models should be re-examined to improve our understanding of initial conditions, quark--gluon plasma (QGP) properties, and the dynamic evolution of the created system.</description>

      <title>Heavy multiquark systems as clusters of smaller units -- a diffusion Monte Carlo calculation --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiquark systems appear less frequently than mesons and baryons despite the enormous world-wide experimental effort that has been made during the last two decades. In this work, we will propose a possible explanation for that fact, restricting ourselves to the case of sets including only $c$ and $\bar{c}$ quarks. We will show that those multiquarks can be thought as different combinations of smaller units that associate together to produce colorless assemblies with a definite value of the total spin. For instance, for the $cccccc$ hexaquark with $S=0$, we have three possibilities: a set of six undistinguishable $c$ quarks, an association of two $ccc$ baryons, or a set of three $cc$ diquarks close together. This means we can have three different values for the mass of an open-charm hexaquark with $S=0$. Using the diffusion Monte Carlo method, we calculate all possible combinations compatible with tetraquark $cc \bar{c} \bar{c}$, pentaquark $cccc \bar{c}$, open-charm $cccccc$ and hidden-charm $ccc \bar{c} \bar{c} \bar{c}$ hexaquark structures with the minimum value of total spin ($S=0$ or $S=1/2$). We consider compact structures with radial wave functions including interactions between all the quarks in the cluster. We find that, in all cases, the mass of the multiquark decreases with the number of small units that conform the set of quarks. For instance, an open charm hexaquark made up of three diquarks has a smaller mass than a set of six of $c$ undistinguishable units. When the pieces that conform the multiquark are themselves colorless with a definite value of the total spin, the cluster splits into those smaller units that separate infinitely from each other.</description>

      <title>First measurement of discrimination between helium and electron recoils in liquid xenon for low-mass dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first measurement of discrimination between low-energy helium recoils and electron recoils in liquid xenon. This result is relevant to proposed low-mass dark matter searches which seek to dissolve light target nuclei in the active volume of liquid-xenon time projection chambers. Low-energy helium recoils were produced by degrading $\alpha$ particles from $^{210}$Po with a gold foil situated on the cathode of a liquid xenon time-projection chamber. The resulting population of helium recoil events is well separated from electron recoils and is also offset from the expected position of xenon nuclear recoil events.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) polarization in proton-proton collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider using PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production mechanisms of charmonium states in both hadronic and heavy-ion collisions hold great significance for investigating the hot and dense QCD matter. Studying charmonium polarization in ultra-relativistic collisions can also provide insights into the underlying production mechanisms. With this motivation, we explore the $J/\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) polarization in proton+proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7, 8, and 13 TeV using a pQCD-inspired Monte-Carlo event generator called PYTHIA8. This work considers reconstructed quarkonia through their dimuons decay channel in the ALICE forward rapidity acceptance range of $2.5 &lt; y_{\mu \mu} &lt; 4$. Further, we calculate the polarization parameters $\lambda_{\theta}$, $\lambda_{\phi}$, $\lambda_{\theta \phi}$ from the polar and azimuthal angular distributions of the dimuons in helicity and Collins-Soper frames. This study presents a comprehensive measurement of the polarization parameters as a function of transverse momentum, charged-particle multiplicity, and rapidity at the LHC energies. Our findings of charmonium polarization are in qualitative agreement with the corresponding experimental data.</description>

      <title>Transversity PDFs of the proton from lattice QCD with physical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the transversity isovector- and isoscalar-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton utilizing a perturbative matching at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy. Additionally, we determine the isovector and isoscalar tensor charges for the proton. In both calculations, the disconnected contributions to the isoscalar matrix elements have been ignored. The calculations are performed using a single ensemble of $N_f = 2 +1$ highly-improved staggered quarks simulated with physical-mass quarks and a lattice spacing of $a = 0.076$ fm. The Wilson-clover action, with physical quark masses and smeared gauge links obtained from one iteration of hypercubic smearing, is used in the valence sector. Using the NLO operator product expansion, we extract the lowest four to six Mellin moments and the PDFs via a neural network from the matrix elements in the pseudo-PDF approach. In addition, we calculate the PDFs in the quasi-PDF approach with hybrid-scheme renormalization and the recently developed leading-renormalon resummation technique, at NLO with the resummation of leading small-$x$ logarithms.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector Continuation and Projection-Based Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenvector continuation is a computational method for parametric eigenvalue problems that uses subspace projection with a basis derived from eigenvector snapshots from different parameter sets. It is part of a broader class of subspace-projection techniques called reduced-basis methods. In this colloquium article, we present the development, theory, and applications of eigenvector continuation and projection-based emulators. We introduce the basic concepts, discuss the underlying theory and convergence properties, and present recent applications for quantum systems and future prospects.</description>
