      <title>Measurement of the electric dipole moment of AlCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the measurement of the electric dipole moment of aluminum monochloride (AlCl) using a cryogenic buffer-gas beam source. Our measurements provide values for the dipole moments of the two lowest vibrational states of the $X^1\Sigma^+$ and the $A^1\Pi$ electronic states. We also show that spin-orbit coupling with an extended number of spin states is essential in the ab initio calculation to correctly describe both the dipole moment and the Te energy of AlCl. We further lay out the implications of these results for astrophysical models of stellar and planetary evolution that have used a substitute value for the dipole moment of AlCl until now.</description>

      <title>Narrowline Laser Cooling and Spectroscopy of Molecules via Stark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic energy level structure of yttrium monoxide (YO) provides long-lived excited $^{2}\Delta$ states ideal for high-precision molecular spectroscopy, narrowline laser cooling at the single photon-recoil limit, and studying dipolar physics with unprecedented interaction strength. We use ultracold laser-cooled YO molecules to study the Stark effect in the metastable A$^{\prime}\,^{2}\Delta_{3/2}\,J=3/2$ state by high-resolution laser spectroscopy. We determined the absolute transition frequency from this metastable state to the X$\,^2\Sigma^+$ electronic ground state with a fractional uncertainty of 9 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$. In the presence of weak electric fields a linear Stark effect is observed in the A$^{\prime}\,^{2}\Delta_{3/2}$ state owing to the large electric dipole moment and near degenerate $\Lambda$-doublet states. A quasi-closed photon cycling scheme is identified involving a narrowline transition to a single Stark state, and implemented in free space to demonstrate the first narrowline laser cooling of a molecule, reducing the temperature of sub-Doppler cooled YO in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry analysis of Autler-Townes doublet in the trap-loss fluorescence spectroscopy of cesium MOT with single step Rydberg excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autler-Townes (AT) doublet, a fundamental manifestation of quantum interference effects, serves as a critical tool for studying the dynamic behavior of Rydberg atoms. Here, we investigate the asymmetry of the Autler-Townes (AT) doublet in trap-loss fluorescence spectroscopy (TLFS) of cesium (Cs) atoms confined in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) with single-step Rydberg excitation using a 319-nm ultraviolet (UV) laser. A V-type three-level system involving the ground state $6\text{S}_{1/2}$ ($\text{F}$=4), excited state $6\text{P}_{3/2}$ ($\text{F}^{'}$=5) , and Rydberg state ($n\text{P}_{3/2}$ ($\text{m}_\text{J}$=+3/2)) is theoretically modeled to analyze the nonlinear dependence of the AT doublet's asymmetry and interval on the cooling laser detuning. Experiments reveal that as the cooling laser detuning $\Delta_1$ decreases from $-$15 MHz to $-$10 MHz, the AT doublet exhibits increasing symmetry, while its interval shows a nonlinear decrease. Theoretical simulations based on the density matrix equation and Lindblad master equation align closely with experimental data, confirming the model's validity. This study provides insights into quantum interference dynamics in multi-level systems and offers a systematic approach for optimizing precision measurements in cold atom spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>On damping of Rabi oscillations in two-photon Raman excitation in cold $^{87}$Rb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon Raman excitation between the ground hyperfine states $|5 \ ^2S_{1/2}, F = 2\rangle$ and $|5 \ ^2S_{1/2}, F = 1\rangle$ of $^{87}$Rb atom has been experimentally studied. The Rabi coupling strengths of various transition involved have been calculated in presence of a weak magnetic field. A density matrix formalism has been developed to understand the experimentally observed damping of Rabi oscillations of population in a hyperfine state of $^{87}$Rb atom during interaction with the Raman laser beams. The observed damping of Rabi oscillations has been attributed to the dephasing during the light atom interaction.</description>

      <title>Constraints on violation of Lorentz symmetry with clock-comparison redshift experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz symmetry is a cornerstone of both the General relativity and Standard Model and its experimental verification deepens our understanding of nature. This paper focuses on the investigation of Lorentz violations with the context of clock comparison experiments in the framework of Standard Model Extension (SME). Considering matter-gravity coupling sector, we provide a generic frame to study the sensitivities of Lorentz-violating coefficients for three distinct types of clock redshift tests, including the traditional gravitational redshift test, null-redshift test I and null-redshift test II. Each of these tests is sensitivity to different combinations of Lorentz-violating coefficients. By using the current clock comparison results, we estimate the limits of SME coefficients at level of parts in $10^{4}$ down to parts in $10^{7}$. Better sensitivity may be achieved in the clock comparisons by using the state-of-the-art optical clocks. Additionally considering relativistic factors in null-redshift I, the frequency comparison result of E2 and E3 transitions of Yb$^{+}$ can set the limit $c^{e}_{00}=(7.4\pm9.3)\times10^{-9}$ in the electron sector. Our analysis demonstrates that clock-comparison redshift experiments may contribute to explore the vast parameters space on searching for the Lorentz violation.</description>

      <title>Collinear laser spectroscopy on neutron-rich actinium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution collinear laser spectroscopy of neutron-rich actinium has been performed at TRIUMF's isotope separator and accelerator facility ISAC. By probing the $7s^2~^1S_0$ $\rightarrow$ $6d7p~^1P_1$ ionic transition, the hyperfine structures and optical isotope shifts in $^{225, 226, 228, 229}\!$Ac$^+$ have been measured. This allows precise determinations of the changes in mean-square charge radii, magnetic dipole moments, and electric quadrupole moments of these actinium isotopes. The improved precision of charge radii and magnetic moments clears the ambiguity in the odd-even staggering from previous studies. The electric quadrupole moments of $^{225, 226, 228, 229}\!$Ac are determined for the first time.</description>

      <title>Error correction of a logical qubit encoded in a single atomic ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for quantum computers to perform useful algorithms, but large-scale fault-tolerant computation remains out of reach due to demanding requirements on operation fidelity and the number of controllable quantum bits (qubits). Traditional QEC schemes involve encoding each logical qubit into multiple physical qubits, requiring a significant overhead in resources and complexity. Recent theoretical work has proposed a complementary approach of performing error correction at the single-particle level by taking advantage of additional available quantum states, potentially reducing QEC overhead. However, this approach has not been demonstrated experimentally, due in part to the difficulty of performing error measurements and subsequent error correction with high fidelity. Here we demonstrate QEC in a single atomic ion that decreases errors by a factor of up to 2.2 and extends the qubit's useful lifetime by a factor of up to 1.5 compared to an unencoded qubit. The qubit is encoded in spin-cat logical states, and we develop a scheme for autonomous error correction that does not require mid-circuit measurements of an ancilla. Our work is applicable to a wide variety of finite-dimensional quantum systems, and such encodings may prove useful either as components of larger QEC codes, or when used alone in few-qubit devices, such as quantum network nodes.</description>

      <title>Stability of macroscopic spin ensembles against inhomogeneous dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin ensembles play a pivotal role in various quantum applications such as metrology and simulating many-body physics. Recent research has proposed utilizing spin cat states to encode logical quantum information, with logical lifetimes potentially on the order of seconds, achieved via enhanced collective interactions that scale with system size. We investigate the dynamics of spin cat states under inhomogeneous broadening, revealing a phenomenon termed 'parity-sensitive inhomogeneous dephasing': for small amplitudes, odd cat states are significantly more susceptible to inhomogeneous dephasing compared to even cat states due to the difference in parity symmetry. This discrepancy between even and odd cat states vanishes at large amplitudes, and behave similarly to a spin coherent state with the same amplitude. To analyze the stability of the spin coherent state, we perform a mean-field analysis of the driven-dissipative dynamics, from which we identify a synchronization phase transition wherein the ensemble becomes completely dephased beyond a critical inhomogeneous linewidth. The mean-field analysis suggests that the dissipative stabilization can suppress the decoherence effects from inhomogeneous broadening. We argue that the stability of the mean-field model provides a reasonable estimate for that of spin cat states with a large amplitude in the full quantum model. Our findings shed light on the stability of collective spin states, important for advancing quantum technologies.</description>
