      <title>Angular distribution of electron emission from ultrafast nanotip sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the angular distribution of ultrafast laser-induced electron emission from a tungsten nanotip in the multiphoton regime. A theoretical model allows precise determination of the relative contribution of different electron emission mechanisms, revealing connections between emission mechanism and the angular distribution of emitted electrons. We infer a continuous map of the work function across the surface of the tip, which in combination with the model can be used to predict values including the number of electrons per pulse and the angular divergence of the resulting beam as a function of laser power and tip voltage for (310)-oriented tungsten nanotips. The model is straightforward to implement and can be used to optimize the performance of instruments using ultrafast nanotip electron sources.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Glucose Sensing at Terahertz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates an on-chip anhydrous D-glucose sensor based using a coplanar stripline (CPS) on a thin (1 um) silicon nitride membrane at terahertz (THz) frequencies. A thin layer (~10 um) of D-glucose was placed in close proximity to the CPS and the transmission response was measured using a modified THz-TDS setup. The D-glucose introduces frequency-dependent changes to the effective permittivity of the CPS resulting in a modified spectral response at the receiver. Measurement results show absorption signatures at 1.42 THz and 2.07 THz corresponding to the first two significant resonances beyond 1 THz for D-glucose allowing for label-free detection. The frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient was estimated by simulation for several D-glucose layer thicknesses using a modified Lorentz model. Measurement results align with simulations and other literature that use free-space THz radiation. This work verifies on-chip THz sensing of D-glucose and presents a pathway towards on-chip sensing of other materials at THz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable, Multifunctional Origami Electronic Membranes for Mechanical and Environmental Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a concept of origami electronic membranes that leverages the design and fabrication of flexible electronics and the mechanical behavior of engineering origami to achieve unique multifunctional, shape-reconfigurable, and adaptive membranes for mechanical and environmental sensing in benign and harsh conditions. This paper presents the materials, design, and fabrication methods for realizing six origami electronic membranes capable of reconfiguring planar or three-dimensional shapes based on the modified flasher, Kresling, Miura-ori, circular, letter, and Tachi-Miura origami patterns. These origami-based, thin-film flexible electronics can obtain both expansion and folding of their shapes, as well as transformation between different geometries. The origami electronic membranes can achieve mechanical and environmental sensing functions such as measuring motions, mechanical strains, temperatures, UV light, and humidity. The results reported here demonstrate the promise of combining engineering origami with flexible electronics to advance the state-of-the-art in multifunctional foldable and deployable electronics and systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Structural Morphology Imaged by Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy is a powerful technique for spatially resolving nanoscale structural morphologies by diffraction contrast. One of the critical challenges in experimental nanodiffraction data analysis is posed by the convergence angle of nanoscale focusing optics which creates simultaneous dependency of the far-field scattering data on three independent components of the local strain tensor - corresponding to dilation and two potential rigid body rotations of the unit cell. All three components are in principle resolvable through a spatially mapped sample tilt series however traditional data analysis is computationally expensive and prone to artifacts. In this study, we implement NanobeamNN, a convolutional neural network specifically tailored to the analysis of scanning probe X-ray microscopy data. NanobeamNN learns lattice strain and rotation angles from simulated diffraction of a focused X-ray nanobeam by an epitaxial thin film and can directly make reasonable predictions on experimental data without the need for additional fine-tuning. We demonstrate that this approach represents a significant advancement in computational speed over conventional methods, as well as a potential improvement in accuracy over the current standard.</description>

      <title>Selective Undercut of Undoped Optical Membranes for Spin-Active Color Centers in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is a semiconductor used in quantum information processing, microelectromechanical systems, photonics, power electronics, and harsh environment sensors. However, its high temperature stability, high breakdown voltage, wide bandgap, and high mechanical strength are accompanied by a chemical inertness which makes complex micromachining difficult. Photoelectrochemical etching is a simple, rapid means of wet processing SiC, including the use of dopant selective etch stops that take advantage of mature SiC homoepitaxy. However, dopant selective photoelectrochemical etching typically relies on highly doped material, which poses challenges for device applications such as quantum defects and photonics that benefit from low doping to produce robust emitter properties and high optical transparency. In this work, we develop a new, selective photoelectrochemical etching process that relies not on high doping but on the electrical depletion of a fabricated diode structure, allowing the selective etching of an n-doped substrate wafer versus an undoped epitaxial ($N_a=1(10)^{14}cm^{-3}$) device layer. We characterize the photo-response and photoelectrochemical etching behavior of the diode under bias and use those insights to suspend large ($&gt;100\mu m^2$) undoped membranes of SiC. We further characterize the compatibility of membranes with quantum emitters, performing comparative spin spectroscopy between undoped and highly doped membrane structures, finding the use of undoped material improves ensemble spin lifetime by $&gt;3x$. This work enables the fabrication of high-purity suspended thin films suitable for scalable photonics, mechanics, and quantum technologies in SiC.</description>

      <title>Single MoS2-flake as a high TCR non-cryogenic bolometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of a bolometer can be tuned by modifying the thermal conductance of an absorbing materials since they sense radiations via the temperature change in the absorber. However, the thermal conductance of the absorber can be reduced by engineering the appropriate thermal isolation, which can be an ultimate solution towards making a highly sensitive thermal detector. Here, we have developed an atomically thin 2D bolometer detector made up of a mechanically transferred suspended multilayer-MoS2 flake, eliminating the use of challenging thin-film fabrication process. The strength of our detector lies on the two factors: its large surface-to-volume window to absorb the radiations; the suspended configuration which prevents the heat dissipation through the substrate and therefore reduces the thermal conductance. The bolometric response of the detector is tested in both modes, via the photoresponse and the thermal response. The prototype is found to exhibit a very high TCR ~ -9.5%/K with the least achievable thermal noise-equivalent power (NEP) ~ 0.61 pWHz-1/2, in ambient conditions at 328 K.</description>

      <title>On the application of components manufactured with stereolithographic 3D printing in high vacuum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a method for using stereolithographic (SLA) additive manufacturing to rapidly and cheaply prototype components for use in high-vacuum environments. We demonstrate the primary vacuum contaminant from freshly printed SLA plastics is water with no evidence of polymers out-gassing from the material and thus the vacuum performance can be controlled with simple treatments which do not involve surface sealing. An unbaked vacuum system containing SLA printed parts achieved 1.9e-8 mbar base pressure whilst retaining structural integrity and manufacturing accuracy. Preliminary results indicate that our method can be extended to achieve ultrahigh-vacuum compatibility by baking at higher temperatures. We further report on the effect of atmospheric exposure to components and present evidence to suggest that re-wetting occurs exclusively in the component skin layer, by showing that the bulk mass changes of the material is irreversible on the timescale investigated (&lt; 2 weeks).</description>

      <title>Tailoring wetting properties of organic hole-transport interlayers for slot-die coated perovskite solar modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with anchoring groups was considered as an effective approach for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells with metal oxide charge transporting layers. However, the coating of SAM layers in PSMs by means of a slot-die is a challenging process due to the low viscosity of the solutions and the low wettability of the films. In this study, we integrate a triphenylamine-based polymer, pTPA-TDP, blended with SAM based on 5-[4-[4-(diphenylamino) phenyl] thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (TPATC), to address the challenges of uniform slot-die coating and interface passivation in large-area modules. We fabricated p-i-n oriented PSMs on 50x50 mm2 substrates (12-sub-cells) with NiO hole transport layer (HTL) and organic interlayers for surface modification. Wetting angle mapping demonstrated that ununiform regions of the slot-die coated SAM have hydrophobicity with contact angle values up to 90{\deg}, causing fluctuations in absorber thickness and the presence of macro-defects at buried interfaces. The incorporation of the blended interlayer to NiO/perovskite junction homogenized the surface wettability (contact angle=40{\deg}) and mitigated lattice strain in the absorber. This enabled the effective use of SAM properties on a large-area surface, improving energy level alignment and enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the modules from 13.98% to 15.83% and stability (ISOS-L-2, T80 period) from 500-1000 hours to 1630 hours. Investigation of PSMs upon cooling till -5 {\deg}C showed that the PCE increased by +0.19%/{\deg}C for samples with NiO HTL, while using SAM and blended interlayers raised the coefficient to ~0.40%/{\deg}C due to changes in activation energy and trap contributions to device performance across a wide temperature range.</description>

      <title>A green solvent system for precursor phase-engineered sequential deposition of stable formamidinium lead triiodide for perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer an efficient, inexpensive alternative to current photovoltaic technologies, with the potential for manufacture via high-throughput coating methods. However, challenges for commercial-scale solution-processing of metal-halide perovskites include the use of harmful solvents, the expense of maintaining controlled atmospheric conditions, and the inherent instabilities of PSCs under operation. Here, we address these challenges by introducing a high volatility, low toxicity, biorenewable solvent system to fabricate a range of 2D perovskites, which highly effective precursor phases for subsequent transformation to alpha-formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3), fully processed under ambient conditions. PSCs utilising our FAPbI3 reproducibly show remarkable stability under illumination and elevated temperature (ISOS-L-2) and "damp heat" (ISOS-D-3) stressing, surpassing other state-of-the-art perovskite compositions. We determine that this enhancement is a consequence of the 2D precursor phase crystallisation route, which simultaneously avoids retention of residual low-volatility solvents (such as DMF and DMSO) and reduces the rate of degradation of FA+ in the material. Our findings highlight both the critical role of the initial crystallisation process in determining the operational stability of perovskite materials, and that neat FA+-based perovskites can be competitively stable despite the inherent metastability of the alpha-phase.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate chip-scale sub-Doppler spectroscopy in an integrated and fiber-coupled photonic-metasurface device. The device is a stack of three planar components: a photonic mode expanding grating emitter circuit with a monolithically integrated tilt compensating dielectric metasurface, a microfabricated atomic vapor cell and a mirror. The metasurface photonic circuit efficiently emits a 130 micrometer-wide $1/e^2$ diameter) collimated surface-normal beam with only -6.3 dB loss and couples the reflected beam back into the connecting fiber, requiring no alignment between the stacked components. We develop a simple model based on light propagation through the photonic device to interpret the atomic spectroscopy signals and explain spectral features covering the full Rb hyperfine state manifold.</description>

      <title>Real-time Deformation Correction in Additively Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $&lt;1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.56 mm$^2$ area and 78.5 mW power per tile.</description>

      <title>Growth of VO2-ZnS Thin Film Cavity for Adaptive Thermal Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-weight, passive, thermal-adaptive radiation technologies are needed to maintain an operable temperature for spacecraft while they experience various energy fluxes. In this study, we used a thin-film coating with the Fabry-Perot (FP) effect to enhance emissivity contrast ({\Delta}{\epsilon}) between VO2 phase-change states. This coating utilizes a novel hybrid material architecture that combines VO2 with a mid- and long-wave infrared transparent chalcogenide, zinc sulfide (ZnS), as a cavity spacer layer. We simulated the design parameter space to obtain a theoretical maximum {\Delta}{\epsilon} of 0.63 and grew prototype devices. Using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, we determined that an intermediate buffer layer of TiO2 is necessary to execute the crystalline growth of monoclinic VO2 on ZnS. Through temperature-dependent FTIR spectroscopy measurements, our fabricated devices demonstrated FP-cavity enhanced adaptive thermal emittance.</description>

      <title>Balanced Coupling in Electromagnetic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotating wave approximation (RWA) is ubiquitous in the analysis of driven and coupled resonators. However, the limitations of the RWA seem to be poorly understood and in some cases the RWA disposes of essential physics. We investigate the RWA in the context of electrical resonant circuits. Using a classical Hamiltonian approach, we find that by balancing electrical and magnetic components of the resonator drive or resonator-resonator coupling, the RWA can be made exact. This type of balance, in which the RWA is exact, has applications in superconducting qubits where it suppresses nutation normally associated with strong Rabi driving. In the context of dispersive readout, balancing the qubit-resonator coupling changes the qubit leakage induced by the resonator drive (MIST), but does not remove it in the case of the transmon qubit.</description>

      <title>Bright electrically contacted circular Bragg grating resonators with deterministically integrated quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity-enhanced emission of electrically controlled semiconductor quantum dots is essential in developing bright quantum devices for real-world quantum photonic applications. Combining the circular Bragg grating (CBG) approach with a PIN-diode structure, we propose and implement an innovative concept for ridge-based electrically-contacted CBG resonators. Through fine-tuning of device parameters in numerical simulations and deterministic nanoprocessing, we produced electrically controlled single quantum dot CBG resonators with excellent electro-optical emission properties. These include multiple wavelength-tunable emission lines and a photon extraction efficiency (PEE) of up to (30.4$\pm$3.4)%, where refined numerical optimization based on experimental findings suggests a substantial improvement, promising PEE &gt;50%. Additionally, the developed quantum light sources yield single-photon purity reaching (98.8$\pm$0.2)% [post-selected: (99.5$\pm$0.3)%] and a photon indistinguishability of (25.8$\pm$2.1)% [post-selected: (92.8$\pm$4.8)%]. Our results pave the way for high-performance quantum devices with combined cavity enhancement and deterministic charge-environment controls, advancing the development of photonic quantum information systems such as complex quantum repeater networks.</description>

      <title>Two-tone spectroscopy of high-frequency quantum circuits with a Josephson emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform two-tone spectroscopy on quantum circuits, where high-frequency radiation is generated by a voltage-biased superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junction and detection is carried out by an ancillary microwave resonator. We implement this protocol on two different systems, a transmon qubit and a $\lambda/4$ resonator. We demonstrate that this two-tone Josephson spectroscopy operates well into the millimeter-wave band, reaching frequencies larger than 80 GHz, and is well-suited for probing highly coherent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Optical Investigations of Coherence and Relaxation Dynamics of a Thulium-doped Yttrium Gallium Garnet Crystal at sub-Kelvin Temperatures for Optical Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth ion-doped crystals are of great interest for quantum memories, a central component in future quantum repeaters. To assess the promise of 1$\%$ Tm$^{3+}$-doped yttrium gallium garnet (Tm:YGG), we report measurements of optical coherence and energy-level lifetimes of its $^3$H$_6$ $\leftrightarrow$ $^3$H$_4$ transition at a temperature of around 500 mK and various magnetic fields. Using spectral hole burning, we find hyperfine ground-level (Zeeman level) lifetimes of several minutes at magnetic fields of less than 1000 G. We also measure coherence time exceeding one millisecond using two-pulse photon echoes. Three-pulse photon echo and spectral hole burning measurements reveal that due to spectral diffusion, the effective coherence time reduces to a few $\mu$s over a timescale of around two hundred seconds. Finally, temporal and frequency-multiplexed storage of optical pulses using the atomic frequency comb protocol is demonstrated. Our results suggest Tm:YGG to be promising for multiplexed photonic quantum memory for quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of integrated-circuit activity using quantum defects in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous scaling of semiconductor-based technologies to micron and sub-micron regimes has resulted in higher device density and lower power dissipation. Many physical phenomena such as self-heating or current leakage become significant at such scales, and mapping current densities to reveal these features is decisive for the development of modern electronics. However, advanced non-invasive technologies either offer low sensitivity or poor spatial resolution and are limited to two-dimensional spatial mapping. Here we use near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond to probe Oersted fields created by current flowing within a multi-layered integrated circuit in pre-development. We show the reconstruction of the three-dimensional components of the current density with a magnitude down to about $\approx 10 \,\rm \mu A / \mu m^2$ and sub-micron spatial resolution at room temperature. We also report the localisation of currents in different layers and observe anomalous current flow in an electronic chip. Our method provides, therefore a decisive step toward three-dimensional current mapping in technologically relevant nanoscale electronics chips.</description>

      <title>5.0 $\mu$m emitting Interband Cascade Lasers with Superlattice and Bulk AlGaAsSb Claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19165v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparison between interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with a 6-stage active region emitting at 5 $\mu$m with AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings and with bulk Al_0.85 Ga_0.15 As_0.07 Sb_0.93 claddings. Utilizing bulk AlGaAsSb claddings with their lower refractive index compared to the more commonly used AlSb/InAs superlattice claddings, the mode-confinement in the active region increases by 14.4% resulting in an improvement of the lasing threshold current density. For broad area laser and under pulsed excitation, the ICL with AlGaAsSb claddings shows a lower threshold current density of J_th=396 A/cm$^2$ compared to J_th=521 A/cm$^2$ for the reference ICL with superlattice claddings. Additionally, a higher characteristic temperature was obtained for the ICL with bulk claddings. A measured pulsed operation is observed up to 65 C.</description>

      <title>Inversion of simulated and experimental light scattering data for characterization of two-dimensional randomly rough metal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.12650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An approach is presented for the inversion of simulated and experimental in-plane, co-polarized light scattering data in p and s polarization to obtain the normalized surface-height autocorrelation function and the rms-roughness of a two-dimensional randomly rough metal surface. The approach is based on an expression, obtained on the basis of second-order phase perturbation theory, for the contribution to the mean differential reflection coefficient from the light scattered diffusely by the rough surface. The inversion scheme is validated by using several sets of computer generated scattering data for rough silver surfaces defined by Gaussian surface height correlation functions. The reconstructions obtained by this approach are found to be rather accurate for weakly rough surfaces illuminated by p- and s-polarized incident light; this is also true in cases where the contributions to the input data from multiple scattering of surface plasmon polaritons is not insignificant. Finally, the inversion scheme is applied to experimental scattering data obtained for characterized two-dimensional randomly rough gold surfaces, and the results obtained in this way, compare favorably to what is obtained by directly analyzing the surface morphology. Such results testify to the attractiveness of the computationally efficient inversion scheme that we propose.</description>

      <title>GaSb-based Interband Cascade Laser with hybrid superlattice plasmon-enhanced claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an interband cascade laser (ICL) emitting at 5.2 {\mu}m consisting of an 8-stage active region and a hybrid cladding composed of outer plasmon-enhanced InAs_0.915 Sb_0.085 and inner InAs/AlSb superlattice claddings. The hybrid cladding architecture shows an increase in mode-confinement in the active region by 11.2 % according to the simulation. This is a consequence of a significantly lower refractive index of plasmon-enhanced claddings. The threshold current density is 242 A/cm^2 in pulsed operation at room temperature. This is the lowest value reported to date for ICLs emitting at wavelengths longer than 5 {\mu}m. We also report close to record value threshold power density of 840 W/cm^2 for ICLs at such wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Universal equation describes the shape of air bubbles trapped in ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water usually contains dissolved gases, and because freezing is a purifying process these gases must be expelled for ice to form. Bubbles appear at the freezing front and are trapped in ice, making pores. These pores come in a range of sizes from microns to millimeters and their shapes are peculiar; never spherical but elongated, and usually fore-aft asymmetric. We show that these remarkable shapes result of a delicate balance between freezing, capillarity, and mass diffusion. A non-linear ordinary differential equation suffices to describe the bubbles, with only two non-dimensional parameters representing the supersaturation and the freezing rate. Our experiments provide us with a large variety of pictures of bubble shapes. We show that all of them have their rounded tip well described by an asymptotic regime of the differential equation, and that most of them can have their full shape quantitatively matched by a full solution. This enables the measurement of the freezing conditions of ice samples, and the design of freeze-cast porous materials. Furthermore, the equation exhibits a bifurcation that explains why some bubbles grow indefinitely and make long cylindrical ``ice worms'', well known to glaciologists.</description>

      <title>Enhanced second harmonic generation in high-$Q$ all-dielectric metasurfaces with backward frequency conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we employ the quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC) resonance in all-dielectric metasurfaces for efficient nonlinear processes in consideration of the backward frequency conversion. We theoretically study the second-harmonic generation (SHG) from symmetry-broken AlGaAs metasurfaces and reveal the efficiency enhancement empowered by high-$Q$ quasi-BIC resonances. By introducing the correction term of nonlinear polarization at the fundamental wave field to the conventional undepleted approximation, we uncover the effect of backward frequency conversion on the nonlinear conversation efficiency. The SHG efficiency as $2.45\times10^{-2}$ with the developed depleted model, shows a $14.3\%$ decrease compared with $2.86\times10^{-2}$ in conventional undepleted approximation, under the incident intensity of 10 MW/cm$^{2}$. Our results are of significant importance for designing efficient nonlinear metasurfaces supporting high-$Q$ resonances.</description>
