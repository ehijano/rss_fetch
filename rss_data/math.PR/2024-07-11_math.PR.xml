      <title>Limit theorems for Non-Markovian rumor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-Markovian rumor model in the complete graph on $n$ vertices inspired by Daley and Kendall's model. For this model, we prove a functional law of large numbers (FLLN) and a functional central limit theorem (FCLT). We apply these results to a non-Markovian version of the rumor model introduced by Lebensztayn, Machado and Rodr\'{i}guez.</description>

      <title>Sliced Wasserstein Geodesics and Equivalence Wasserstein and Sliced Wasserstein metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper will introduce a family of sliced Wasserstein geodesics which are not standard Wasserstein geodesics, objects yet to be discovered in the literature. These objects exhibit how the geometric structure of the Sliced Wasserstein space differs from the Wasserstein space, and provides a simple example of how solving the barycenter and gradient flow problems change when moving between these metrics. Some of these geodesics will only be H\"older continuous with respect to the Wasserstein metric and thus will provide a direct proof that Sliced-Wasserstein and regular Wasserstein metrics are not equivalent. Previous proofs of this were done for various cases in [2] and [5]. This paper, not only provides a direct proof, but also fills in gaps showing these metrics not equivalent in dimensions greater than 2.</description>

      <title>Convergence of persistence diagrams for discrete time stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we establish two fundamental results for the sublevel set persistent homology for stationary processes indexed by the positive integers. The first is a strong law of large numbers for the persistence diagram (treated as a measure "above the diagonal" in the extended plane) evaluated on a large class of sets and functions$\unicode{x2014}$more than just continuous functions with compact support. We prove this result subject to only minor conditions that the sequence is ergodic and the tails of the marginals are not too heavy. The second result is a central limit theorem for the persistence diagram evaluated on the class of all step functions; this result holds as long as a $\rho$-mixing criterion is satisfied. Our results greatly expand those extant in the literature to allow for more fruitful use in statistical applications, beyond idealized settings. Examples of distributions and functions for which the limit theory holds are provided throughout.</description>

      <title>A Simple Note on the Basic Properties of Subgaussian Random Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note provides a basic description of subgaussianity, by defining $(\sigma, \rho)$-subgaussian random variables $X$ ($\sigma&gt;0, \rho&gt;0$) as those satisfying $\mathbb{E}(\exp(\lambda X))\leq \rho\exp(\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\lambda^2)$ for any $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$. The introduction of the parameter $\rho$ may be particularly useful for those seeking to refine bounds, or align results from different sources, in the analysis of stochastic processes and concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>One-sided Markov additive processes with lattice and non-lattice increments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dating from the work of Neuts in the 1980s, the field of matrix-analytic methods has been developed to analyse discrete or continuous-time Markov chains with a two-dimensional state space in which the increment of a level variable is governed by an auxiliary phase variable. More recently, matrix-analytic techniques have been applied to general Markov additive models with a finite phase space. The basic assumption underlying these developments is that the process is skip-free (in the case of QBDs or fluid queues) or that it is one-sided, that is it is jump-free in one direction.
  From the Markov additive perspective, traditional matrix-analytic models can be viewed as special cases: for M/G/1 and GI/M/1-type Markov chains, increments in the level are constrained to be lattice random variables and for fluid queues, they have to be piecewise linear.
  In this paper we discuss one-sided lattice and non-lattice Markov additive processes in parallel. Results that are standard in one tradition are interpreted in the other, and new perspectives emerge. In particular, using three fundamental matrices, we address hitting, two-sided exit, and creeping probabilities.</description>

      <title>Shocks and instability in Brownian last-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi (SHJ) equations, instability points are the space-time locations where two eternal solutions with the same asymptotic velocity differ. Another crucial structure in such equations is shocks, which are the space-time locations where the velocity field is discontinuous. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the structure and relationships between shocks, instability, and competition interfaces in the Brownian last-passage percolation model, which serves as a prototype of a semi-discrete inviscid stochastic HJ equation in one space dimension. Among our findings, we show that the shock trees of the two unstable eternal solutions differ within the instability region and align outside of it. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one can reconstruct a skeleton of the instability region from these two shock trees.</description>

      <title>Geodesics in planar Poisson roads random metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of geodesics in the fractal random metric constructed by Kendall from a self-similar Poisson process of roads (i.e, lines with speed limits) in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In particular, we prove a conjecture of Kendall stating that geodesics do not pause en route, i.e, use roads of arbitrary small speed except at their endpoints. It follows that the geodesic frame of $\left(\mathbb{R}^2,T\right)$ is the set of points on roads. We also consider geodesic stars and hubs, and give a complete description of the local structure of geodesics around points on roads. Notably, we prove that leaving a road by driving off-road is never geodesic.</description>

      <title>Self-similar Markov trees and scaling limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-similar Markov trees constitute a remarkable family of random compact real trees carrying a decoration function that is positive on the skeleton. As the terminology suggests, they are self-similar objects that further satisfy a Markov branching property. They are built from the combination of the recursive construction of real trees by gluing line segments with the seminal observation of Lamperti, which relates positive self-similar Markov processes and L\'evy processes via a time change. They carry natural length and harmonic measures, which can be used to perform explicit spinal decompositions. Self-similar Markov trees encompass a large variety of random real trees that have been studied over the last decades, such as the Brownian CRT, stable L\'evy trees, fragmentation trees, and growth-fragmentation trees. We establish general invariance principles for multi-type Galton--Watson trees with integer types and illustrate them with many combinatorial classes of random trees that have been studied in the literature, including (possibly dissipative) discrete fragmentation trees, peeling trees of Boltzmann (possibly $O(n)$-decorated) planar maps, or even the more recent fully parked trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general approximation method for determining optimal trading strategies in markets with proportional transaction costs, with a polynomial approximation of the residual value function. The method is exemplified by several problems from optimally tracking benchmarks, hedging the Log contract, to maximizing utility from terminal wealth. Strategies are also approximated by practically executable, discrete trades. We identify the necessary trade-off between trading frequency and trade sizes to have satisfactory agreement with the theoretically optimal, continuous strategies of infinite activity.</description>

      <title>Viscosity estimation for 2D pipe flows I. Construction, consistency, asymptotic normality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the motion of incompressible viscous fluid in a rectangle, imposing the periodicity condition in one direction and the no-slip boundary condition in the other. Assuming that the flow is subject to an external random force, white in time and regular in space, we construct an estimator for the viscosity using only observations of the enstrophy. The goal of the paper is to prove that the estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. The proof of consistency is based on the explicit formula for the estimator and some bounds for trajectories, while that of asymptotic normality uses in addition mixing properties of the Navier-Stokes flow.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebra structures for the backward error analysis of ergodic stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While backward error analysis does not generalise straightforwardly to the strong and weak approximation of stochastic differential equations, it extends for the sampling of ergodic dynamics. The calculation of the modified equation relies on tedious calculations and there is no expression of the modified vector field, in opposition to the deterministic setting. We uncover in this paper the Hopf algebra structures associated to the laws of composition and substitution of exotic aromatic S-series, relying on the new idea of clumping. We use these algebraic structures to provide the algebraic foundations of stochastic numerical analysis with S-series, as well as an explicit expression of the modified vector field as an exotic aromatic B-series.</description>

      <title>Bayesian weighted time-lapse full-waveform inversion using a receiver-extension strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-lapse full-waveform inversion (FWI) has become a powerful tool for characterizing and monitoring subsurface changes in various geophysical applications. However, non-repeatability (NR) issues caused, for instance, by GPS inaccuracies, often make it difficult to obtain unbiased time-lapse models. In this work we explore the portability of combining a receiver-extension FWI approach and Bayesian analysis to mitigate time-lapse noises arising from NR issues. The receiver-extension scheme introduces an artificial degree of freedom in positioning receivers, intending to minimize kinematic mismatches between modeled and observed data. Bayesian analysis systematically explores several potential solutions to mitigate time-lapse changes not associated with reservoir responses, assigning probabilities to each scenario based on prior information and available evidence. We consider two different subsurface models to demonstrate the potential of proposed approaches. First, using the Marmousi model, we investigate two NR scenarios associated with background noise in seismic data. Second, using a challenging deep-water Brazilian pre-salt setting, we investigate several NR scenarios to simulate real-world challenges. Our results demonstrate that combining Bayesian analysis with the receiver-extension FWI strategy can mitigate adverse NR effects successfully, producing cleaner and more reliable time-lapse models than conventional approaches. The results also reveal that the proposed Bayesian weighted procedure is a valuable tool for determining time-lapse estimates through statistical analysis of pre-existing models, allowing its application in ongoing time-lapse (4D) projects.</description>

      <title>On Sampling from Ising Models with Spectral Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from the Ising model when the underlying interaction matrix has eigenvalues lying within an interval of length $\gamma$. Recent work in this setting has shown various algorithmic results that apply roughly when $\gamma&lt; 1$, notably with nearly-linear running times based on the classical Glauber dynamics. However, the optimality of the range of $\gamma$ was not clear since previous inapproximability results developed for the antiferromagnetic case (where the matrix has entries $\leq 0$) apply only for $\gamma&gt;2$.
  To this end, Kunisky (SODA'24) recently provided evidence that the problem becomes hard already when $\gamma&gt;1$ based on the low-degree hardness for an inference problem on random matrices. Based on this, he conjectured that sampling from the Ising model in the same range of $\gamma$ is NP-hard.
  Here we confirm this conjecture, complementing in particular the known algorithmic results by showing NP-hardness results for approximately counting and sampling when $\gamma&gt;1$, with strong inapproximability guarantees; we also obtain a more refined hardness result for matrices where only a constant number of entries per row are allowed to be non-zero. The main observation in our reductions is that, for $\gamma&gt;1$, Glauber dynamics mixes slowly when the interactions are all positive (ferromagnetic) for the complete and random regular graphs, due to a bimodality in the underlying distribution. While ferromagnetic interactions typically preclude NP-hardness results, here we work around this by introducing in an appropriate way mild antiferromagnetism, keeping the spectrum roughly within the same range. This allows us to exploit the bimodality of the aforementioned graphs and show the target NP-hardness by adapting suitably previous inapproximability techniques developed for antiferromagnetic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we are concerned with characterising when solutions of perturbed linear stochastic Volterra summation equations are $p$-summable along with when their continuous time counterparts, perturbed linear stochastic Volterra integrodifferential equations are $p$-integrable. In the discrete case we find it necessary and sufficient that perturbing functions are $p$-summable in order to ensure paths of the discrete equation are $p$-summable almost surely, while in the continuous case it transpires one can have almost surely $p$-integrable sample paths even with non-integrable perturbation functions. For the continuous equation the main converse is clinched by considering an appropriate discretisation and applying results from the discrete case.</description>

Abstract: We consider the six-vertex model at its free-fermion point with domain wall boundary conditions, which is equivalent to random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. We compute the scaling limit of a particular non-local correlation function, essentially equivalent to the partition function for the domino tilings of a pentagon-shaped domain, obtained by cutting away a triangular region from a corner of the initial Aztec diamond. We observe a third-order phase transition when the geometric parameters of the obtained pentagonal domain are tuned to have the fifth side exactly tangent to the arctic ellipse of the corresponding initial model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Measure Transport and Neural PDE Solvers for Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of sampling from a probability density can be approached as transporting a tractable density function to the target, known as dynamical measure transport. In this work, we tackle it through a principled unified framework using deterministic or stochastic evolutions described by partial differential equations (PDEs). This framework incorporates prior trajectory-based sampling methods, such as diffusion models or Schr\"odinger bridges, without relying on the concept of time-reversals. Moreover, it allows us to propose novel numerical methods for solving the transport task and thus sampling from complicated targets without the need for the normalization constant or data samples. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the respective PDE solutions, implying both conceptional and computational advantages. In particular, PINNs allow for simulation- and discretization-free optimization and can be trained very efficiently, leading to significantly better mode coverage in the sampling task compared to alternative methods. Moreover, they can readily be fine-tuned with Gauss-Newton methods to achieve high accuracy in sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and regularity of local times for general $d$-dimensional stochastic processes. We give a general condition for their existence and regularity properties. To emphasize the contribution of our results, we show that they include various prominent examples, among others solutions to stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion, where the behavior of the local time was not fully understood up to now and remained as an open problem in the stochastic analysis literature. In particular this completes the picture regarding the local time behavior of such equations, above all includes high dimensions and both large and small Hurst parameters. As other main examples, we also show that by using our general approach, one can quite easily cover and extend some recently obtained results on the local times of the Rosenblatt process and Gaussian quasi-helices.</description>

Abstract: We study some fundamental properties, such as the transience, the recurrence, the first passage times and the zero-set of a certain type of sawtooth Markov processes, called extremal shot noise processes. The sets of zeros of the latter are Mandelbrot's random cutout sets, i.e. the sets of points left uncovered after placing Poisson random covering intervals on the positive half-line. Based on this connection, we provide a new proof of Fitzsimmons-Fristedt-Shepp Theorem which characterizes the random cutout sets.</description>

      <title>Iterated-logarithm laws for convex hulls of random walks with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish laws of the iterated logarithm for intrinsic volumes of the convex hull of many-step, multidimensional random walks whose increments have two moments and a non-zero drift. Analogous results in the case of zero drift, where the scaling is different, were obtained by Khoshnevisan. Our starting point is a version of Strassen's functional law of the iterated logarithm for random walks with drift. For the special case of the area of a planar random walk with drift, we compute explicitly the constant in the iterated-logarithm law by solving an isoperimetric problem reminiscent of the classical Dido problem. For general intrinsic volumes and dimensions, our proof exploits a novel zero--one law for functionals of convex hulls of walks with drift, of some independent interest. As another application of our approach, we obtain iterated-logarithm laws for intrinsic volumes of the convex hull of the centre of mass (running average) process associated to the random walk.</description>

      <title>Finite Markov chains and multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates stochastic finite matrices and the corresponding finite Markov chains constructed using recurrence matrices for general families of orthogonal polynomials and multiple orthogonal polynomials. The paper explores the spectral theory of transition matrices, utilizing both orthogonal and multiple orthogonal polynomials. Several properties are derived, including classes, periodicity, recurrence, stationary states, ergodicity, expected recurrence times, time-reversed chains, and reversibility. Furthermore, the paper uncovers factorization in terms of pure birth and pure death processes. The case study focuses on hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials, where all the computations can be carried out effectively. Particularly within the Askey scheme, all descendants under Hahn (excluding Bessel), such as Hahn, Jacobi, Meixner, Kravchuk, Laguerre, Charlier, and Hermite, present interesting examples of recurrent reversible birth and death finite Markov chains. Additionally, the paper considers multiple orthogonal polynomials, including multiple Hahn, Jacobi-Pi\~neiro, Laguerre of the first kind, and Meixner of the second kind, along with their hypergeometric representations and derives the corresponding recurrent finite Markov chains and time-reversed chains.</description>

      <title>Cover times of many diffusive or subdiffusive searchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cover times measure the speed of exhaustive searches which require the exploration of an entire spatial region(s). Applications include the immune system hunting pathogens, animals collecting food, robotic demining or cleaning, and computer search algorithms. Mathematically, a cover time is the first time a random searcher(s) comes within a specified "detection radius" of every point in the target region (often the entire spatial domain). Due to their many applications and their fundamental probabilistic importance, cover times have been extensively studied in the physics and probability literatures. This prior work has generally studied cover times of a single searcher with a vanishing detection radius or a large target region. This prior work has further claimed that cover times for multiple searchers can be estimated by a simple rescaling of the cover time of a single searcher. In this paper, we study cover times of many diffusive or subdiffusive searchers and show that prior estimates break down as the number of searchers grows. We prove a rather universal formula for all the moments of such cover times in the many searcher limit that depends only on (i) the searcher's characteristic (sub)diffusivity and (ii) a certain geodesic distance between the searcher starting location(s) and the farthest point in the target. This formula is otherwise independent of the detection radius, space dimension, target size, and domain size. We illustrate our results in several examples and compare them to detailed stochastic simulations.</description>

      <title>How Much Can Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Augment Sky Visibility: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses the theory of point processes and stochastic geometry to quantify the sky visibility experienced by users located in an urban environment. The general idea is to represent the buildings of this environment as a stationary marked point process, where the points represent the building locations and the marks their heights. The point process framework is first used to characterize the distribution of the blockage angle, which limits the visibility of a typical user into the sky due to the obstruction by buildings. In the context of communications, this distribution is useful when users try to connect to the nodes of an aerial or non-terrestrial network in a Line-of-Sight way. Within this context, the point process framework can also be used to investigate the gain of connectivity obtained thanks to Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces. Assuming that such surfaces are installed on the top of buildings to extend the user's sky visibility, this point process approach allows one to quantify the gain in visibility and hence the gain in connectivity obtained by the typical user. The distributional properties of visibility-related metrics are cross-validated by comparison to simulation results.</description>

      <title>The density conjecture for activated random walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld developed their theory of self-organized criticality in the late 1980s to explain why many real-life processes exhibit signs of critical behavior despite the absence of a tuning parameter. A decade later, Dickman, Mu\~noz, Vespignani, and Zapperi explained self-organized criticality as an external force pushing a hidden parameter toward the critical value of a traditional absorbing-state phase transition. As evidence, they observed empirically that for various sandpile models, the particle density in a finite box under driven-dissipative dynamics converges to the critical density of an infinite-volume version of the model. We give the first proof of this well-known density conjecture in any setting by establishing it for activated random walk in one dimension. We prove that two other natural versions of the model have the same critical value, further establishing activated random walk as a universal model of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Learning linear operators: Infinite-dimensional regression as a well-behaved non-compact inverse problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a linear operator $\theta$ between two Hilbert spaces from empirical observations, which we interpret as least squares regression in infinite dimensions. We show that this goal can be reformulated as an inverse problem for $\theta$ with the feature that its forward operator is generally non-compact (even if $\theta$ is assumed to be compact or of $p$-Schatten class). However, we prove that, in terms of spectral properties and regularisation theory, this inverse problem is equivalent to the known compact inverse problem associated with scalar response regression.
  Our framework allows for the elegant derivation of dimension-free rates for generic learning algorithms under H\"older-type source conditions. The proofs rely on the combination of techniques from kernel regression with recent results on concentration of measure for sub-exponential Hilbertian random variables. The obtained rates hold for a variety of practically-relevant scenarios in functional regression as well as nonlinear regression with operator-valued kernels and match those of classical kernel regression with scalar response.</description>

      <title>Parallelising Glauber dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For distributions over discrete product spaces $\prod_{i=1}^n \Omega_i'$, Glauber dynamics is a Markov chain that at each step, resamples a random coordinate conditioned on the other coordinates. We show that $k$-Glauber dynamics, which resamples a random subset of $k$ coordinates, mixes $k$ times faster in $\chi^2$-divergence, and assuming approximate tensorization of entropy, mixes $k$ times faster in KL-divergence. We apply this to obtain parallel algorithms in two settings: (1) For the Ising model $\mu_{J,h}(x)\propto \exp(\frac1 2\left\langle x,Jx \right\rangle + \langle h,x\rangle)$ with $\|J\|&lt;1-c$ (the regime where fast mixing is known), we show that we can implement each step of $\widetilde \Theta(n/\|J\|_F)$-Glauber dynamics efficiently with a parallel algorithm, resulting in a parallel algorithm with running time $\widetilde O(\|J\|_F) = \widetilde O(\sqrt n)$. (2) For the mixed $p$-spin model at high enough temperature, we show that with high probability we can implement each step of $\widetilde \Theta(\sqrt n)$-Glauber dynamics efficiently and obtain running time $\widetilde O(\sqrt n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The speed of an exhaustive search can be measured by a cover time, which is defined as the time it takes a random searcher to visit every state in some target set. Cover times have been studied in both the physics and probability literatures, with most prior works focusing on a single searcher. In this paper, we prove an explicit formula for all the moments of the cover time for many searchers on an arbitrary discrete network. Our results show that such cover times depend only on properties of the network along the shortest paths to the most distant parts of the target. This mere local dependence contrasts with the well-known result that cover times for single searchers depend on global properties of the network. We illustrate our rigorous results by stochastic simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a widely acknowledged fact that the product of two positive strong Feller operators on a Polish space $E$ enjoys the ultra Feller property. We present a functional analytic proof of this fact that allows us to drop the assumption that the operators are positive and also extends the applicability of this result to more general state spaces. As it turns out, this result can be considered a variant of the theorem that on a Banach space with the Dunford--Pettis property, the product of two weakly compact operators is compact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Brownian motion with dependent components: turning angle analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion assume that each component is independent. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.</description>
