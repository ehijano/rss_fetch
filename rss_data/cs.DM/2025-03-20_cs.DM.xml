      <title>Exploring the unleaved tree of numerical semigroups up to a given genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm to explore or count the numerical semigroups of a given genus which uses the unleaved version of the tree of numerical semigroups. In the unleaved tree there are no leaves rather than the ones at depth equal to the genus in consideration. For exloring the unleaved tree we present a new encoding system of a numerical semigroup given by the gcd of its left elements and its shrinking, that is, the semigroup generated by its left elements divided by their gcd. We show a method to determine the right generators and strong generators of a semigroup by means of the gcd and the shrinking encoding, as well as a method to encode a semigroup from the encoding of its parent or of its predecessor sibling. With the new algorithm we obtained $n_{76}=29028294421710227$.</description>

      <title>Signed graphs in data sciences via communicability geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signed graphs are an emergent way of representing data in a variety of contexts where antagonistic interactions exist. These include data from biological, ecological, and social systems. Here we propose the concept of communicability for signed graphs and explore in depth its mathematical properties. We also prove that the communicability induces a hyperspherical geometric embedding of the signed network, and derive communicability-based metrics that satisfy the axioms of a distance even in the presence of negative edges. We then apply these metrics to solve several problems in the data analysis of signed graphs within a unified framework. These include the partitioning of signed graphs, dimensionality reduction, finding hierarchies of alliances in signed networks, and quantifying the degree of polarization between the existing factions in social systems represented by these types of graphs.</description>
