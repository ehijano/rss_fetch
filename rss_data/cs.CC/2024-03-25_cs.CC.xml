      <title>Horoballs and the subgradient method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explore convex optimization on Hadamard spaces, we consider an iteration in the style of a subgradient algorithm. Traditionally, such methods assume that the underlying spaces are manifolds and that the objectives are geodesically convex: the methods are described using tangent spaces and exponential maps. By contrast, our iteration applies in a general Hadamard space, is framed in the underlying space itself, and relies instead on horospherical convexity of the objective level sets. For this restricted class of objectives, we prove a complexity result of the usual form. Notably, the complexity does not depend on a lower bound on the space curvature.</description>

      <title>On the complexity and approximability of Bounded access Lempel Ziv coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of constructing an optimal parsing $\varphi$ of a string ${\bf s} = s_1 \dots s_n$ under the constraint that given a position $p$ in the original text, and the LZ76-like (Lempel Ziv 76) encoding of $T$ based on $\varphi$, it is possible to identify/decompress the character $s_p$ by performing at most $c$ accesses to the LZ encoding, for a given integer $c.$ We refer to such a parsing $\varphi$ as a $c$-bounded access LZ parsing or $c$-BLZ parsing of ${\bf s}.$ We show that for any constant $c$ the problem of computing the optimal $c$-BLZ parsing of a string, i.e., the one with the minimum number of phrases, is NP-hard and also APX hard, i.e., no PTAS can exist under the standard complexity assumption $P \neq NP.$ We also study the ratio between the sizes of an optimal $c$-BLZ parsing of a string ${\bf s}$ and an optimal LZ76 parsing of ${\bf s}$ (which can be greedily computed in polynomial time).</description>

      <title>Twisted conjugacy in dihedral Artin groups I: Torus Knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an alternative solution to a result by Juh\'{a}sz that the twisted conjugacy problem for odd dihedral Artin groups is solvable, that is, groups with presentation $G(m) = \langle a,b \; | \; _{m}(a,b) = {}_{m}(b,a) \rangle$, where $m\geq 3$ is odd, and $_{m}(a,b)$ is the word $abab \dots$ of length $m$, is solvable. Our solution provides an implementable linear time algorithm, by considering an alternative group presentation to that of a torus knot group, and working with geodesic normal forms. An application of this result is that the conjugacy problem is solvable in extensions of odd dihedral Artin groups.</description>

      <title>Bi-objective Optimization in Role Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Role mining is a technique used to derive a role-based authorization policy from an existing policy. Given a set of users $U$, a set of permissions $P$ and a user-permission authorization relation $\mahtit{UPA}\subseteq U\times P$, a role mining algorithm seeks to compute a set of roles $R$, a user-role authorization relation $\mathit{UA}\subseteq U\times R$ and a permission-role authorization relation $\mathit{PA}\subseteq R\times P$, such that the composition of $\mathit{UA}$ and $\mathit{PA}$ is close (in some appropriate sense) to $\mathit{UPA}$.
  In this paper, we first introduce the Generalized Noise Role Mining problem (GNRM) -- a generalization of the MinNoise Role Mining problem -- which we believe has considerable practical relevance. Extending work of Fomin et al., we show that GNRM is fixed parameter tractable, with parameter $r + k$, where $r$ is the number of roles in the solution and $k$ is the number of discrepancies between $\mathit{UPA}$ and the relation defined by the composition of $\mathit{UA}$ and $\mathit{PA}$. We further introduce a bi-objective optimization variant of GNRM, where we wish to minimize both $r$ and $k$ subject to upper bounds $r\le \bar{r}$ and $k\le \bar{k}$, where $\bar{r}$ and $\bar{k}$ are constants. We show that the Pareto front of this bi-objective optimization problem (BO-GNRM) can be computed in fixed-parameter tractable time with parameter $\bar{r}+\bar{k}$.
  We then report the results of our experimental work using the integer programming solver Gurobi to solve instances of BO-GNRM. Our key findings are that (a) we obtained strong support that Gurobi's performance is fixed-parameter tractable, (b) our results suggest that our techniques may be useful for role mining in practice, based on our experiments in the context of three well-known real-world authorization policies.</description>

      <title>Sparse juntas on the biased hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.09428v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a structure theorem for Boolean functions on the $p$-biased hypercube which are $\epsilon$-close to degree~$d$ in $L_2$, showing that they are close to \emph{sparse juntas}. Our structure theorem implies that such functions are $O(\epsilon^{C_d} + p)$-close to constant functions. We pinpoint the exact value of the constant $C_d$.
  We also give an analogous result for monotone Boolean functions on the biased hypercube which are $\epsilon$-close to degree~$d$ in $L_2$, showing that they are close to \emph{sparse DNFs}.
  Our structure theorems are optimal in the following sense: for every $d,\epsilon,p$, we identify a class $\mathcal{F}_{d,\epsilon,p}$ of degree~$d$ sparse juntas which are $O(\epsilon)$-close to Boolean (in the monotone case, width~$d$ sparse DNFs) such that a Boolean function on the $p$-biased hypercube is $O(\epsilon)$-close to degree~$d$ in $L_2$ iff it is $O(\epsilon)$-close to a function in $\mathcal{F}_{d,\epsilon,p}$.</description>

      <title>Computation-Limited Signals: A Channel Capacity Regime Constrained by Computational Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we introduce the computational-limited (comp-limited) signals, a communication capacity regime in which the signal time computational complexity overhead is the key constraint -- rather than power or bandwidth -- to the overall communication capacity. We present the Spectro-Computational (SC) analysis, a novel mathematical framework that enhances classic concepts of information theory -- such as throughput, spectral efficiency and capacity -- to account for the signal processing computational complexity overhead. We consider a specific Shannon regime under which capacity is expected to get arbitrarily large as channel resources grow. Under that regime, we identify the conditions under which the time complexity overhead causes capacity to decrease rather than increasing, thereby creating the case for the comp-limited regime. We also provide examples of the SC analysis and show the OFDM waveform is comp-limited unless the lower-bound computational complexity of the $N$-point DFT problem verifies as $\Omega(N)$, which remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Grover's Search Algorithm: A Modified Approach to Increase the Probability of Good States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces an enhancement to the Grover search algorithm to speed up computing the probability of finding good states. It suggests incorporating a rotation phase angle determined mathematically from the derivative of the model during the initial iteration. At each iteration, a new phase angle is computed and used in a rotation gate around y+z axis in the diffusion operator. The computed phase angles are optimized through an adaptive adjustment based on the estimated increasing ratio of the consecutive amplitudes. The findings indicate an average decrease of 28% in the required number of iterations resulting in a faster overall process and fewer number of quantum gates. For large search space, this improvement rises to 29.58%. Given the computational capabilities of the computer utilized for the simulation, the approach is applied to instances with up to 12 qubits or 4096 possible combination of search entries.</description>
