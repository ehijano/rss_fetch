      <title>SURFing to the Fundamental Limit of Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond the practical goal of improving search and measurement sensitivity through better jet tagging algorithms, there is a deeper question: what are their upper performance limits? Generative surrogate models with learned likelihood functions offer a new approach to this problem, provided the surrogate correctly captures the underlying data distribution. In this work, we introduce the SUrrogate ReFerence (SURF) method, a new approach to validating generative models. This framework enables exact Neyman-Pearson tests by training the target model on samples from another tractable surrogate, which is itself trained on real data. We argue that the EPiC-FM generative model is a valid surrogate reference for JetClass jets and apply SURF to show that modern jet taggers may already be operating close to the true statistical limit. By contrast, we find that autoregressive GPT models unphysically exaggerate top vs. QCD separation power encoded in the surrogate reference, implying that they are giving a misleading picture of the fundamental limit.</description>

      <title>The Heavy Dark Photon Handbook: Cosmological and Astrophysical Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological and astrophysical constraints on dark photons with masses $\sim 10^{-1}$-$10^3$ MeV. These dark photons can be copiously produced either in the early universe or during core-collapse supernovae, potentially leaving distinct observational signatures. First, we derive updated constraints from cosmological and astrophysical observables that rely on the thermal relic abundance of dark photons, including the CMB spectrum, primordial light element abundances, and galactic/extragalactic gamma-ray flux. We consider the minimal reheating temperature possible, $T_{\rm RH} = 6 \, \rm MeV$, such that our constraints are conservative, but unavoidable within the minimal dark photon model. Then, for supernova-sourced dark photons, we systematically examine all relevant observational bounds, revisit the standard cooling argument and derive limits from other arguments such as fireball formation, low energy supernovae and galactic positron injection.</description>

      <title>How light can ALP dark matter be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assume axion-like particles (ALPs) to provide the full dark matter abundance and derive various lower bounds on the ALP mass. We contrast the post- and pre-inflationary symmetry breaking cases and present allowed regions in the plane of ALP mass and energy scale of inflation. For the post-inflationary case, we revisit bounds from isocurvature perturbations taking into account that, as suggested by simulations, axion radiation by cosmic strings during the scaling regime provides the dominant production mechanism of dark matter, obtaining significantly weaker limits than previously. Combining isocurvature, with constraints from black hole superradiance and free streaming, we find that the bound $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-17}$ eV applies for most cases considered here. It can be potentially relaxed to $\sim 6\times 10^{-19}$ eV only in the post-inflationary case with a strongly temperature-dependent axion mass, subject to uncertainties on the axion emission spectrum. Significantly stronger bounds are obtained in the post-inflationary scenario from the non-observation of CMB tensor modes, which can be as strong as $m_a &gt; 5\times 10^{-7}$ eV for small reheating efficiencies, $\epsilon \lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Axiverse Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion may offer a unified origin for the baryon asymmetry and dark matter through axiogenesis. However, in the minimal QCD axion scenario, axiogenesis either underproduces baryons or overproduces dark matter, and the required kinetic misalignment initial conditions are in tension with axion quality. In this \textit{Letter}, we demonstrate that the axiverse naturally resolves these tensions: the QCD axion emerges as a linear combination of multiple axion-like fields, evading the overclosure problem thanks to new dissipation channels , while introducing additional Peccei--Quinn symmetries that ensure a high quality QCD axion. We illustrate these points in a toy model with two axions. This framework predicts a rich phenomenology within experimental reach, including dark matter detection prospects, astrophysical signals, and collider signatures.</description>

      <title>Constraints on lepton-flavor mixing with third-generation new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implications of an approximate $U(2)^5$ flavor symmetry at the TeV scale, under the assumption of new physics predominantly coupled to the third-generation fermions, focusing on the breaking of the $U(2)_\ell$ subgroup governing the mixing between second- and third-generation left-handed leptons. We derive constraints on the corresponding spurion parameter $\delta$ from current data on lepton flavor violating (LFV) and lepton flavor universality (LFU) observables, finding that $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and $\mathcal{B}(B_s \to \mu \mu)$ give the most stringent bound on $\delta$, yielding ${|\delta|&lt;0.051}$ at 95% CL. In addition, we provide updated bounds for LFV decay rates and discuss prospects for future sensitivity improvements, finding that future LFV searches could further tighten constraints on the mixing between second- and third-generation leptons.</description>

      <title>Structure Formation with Dark Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range interactions in the dark sector can give rise to collective plasma phenomena that are capable of modifying the evolution of dark matter halos. We present the first study of gravitational collapse in a secluded dark $U(1)_D$ model using a magnetohydrodynamic description of the dark matter. We show that dark magnetic fields generate an anisotropic pressure that alters the Jeans scale and suppresses small-scale power in a direction-dependent manner. For a range of primordial magnetic spectral indices, this effect produces distinctive modifications to the linear matter power spectrum. We find that current observations cannot yet constrain viable dark magnetic fields, as CMB tensor modes mostly provide more stringent constraints. Nevertheless, forthcoming high-resolution probes of the matter power spectrum (CMB-HD lensing, HERA, and EDGES) will be able to test these predictions and are sensitive to dark charge-to-mass ratios in the range $10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}\lesssim q_\chi/m_\chi\lesssim 10^{-14}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Exploring enhanced non-resonant di-Higgs production at the HL-LHC with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate di-Higgs production in the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ final state at the LHC, focusing on scenarios where the gluon fusion process is enhanced by new colored scalars, which could be identified as squarks or leptoquarks. We consider two benchmarks characterized by the mass of the lightest colored scalar, BM$_{\mathrm{L}}$ and BM$_{\mathrm{H}}$, corresponding to 464 GeV and 621 GeV, respectively. Using Monte Carlo simulations for both the signal and the dominant backgrounds, we perform a discovery analysis with deep neural networks, exploring various architectures and input variables. Our results show that the discrimination power is maximized by employing two dedicated classifiers, one trained against QCD backgrounds and another against backgrounds involving single-Higgs processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that including high-level features -- such as the invariant masses $m_{\gamma\gamma}$, $m_{bb}$, and $m_{hh}$, as well as the transverse momenta and angular separations of the photon and $b$-jet pairs -- significantly improves the performance compared to using only low-level features as the invariant mass and momenta of the final particles. For the latter case, we find that architectures processing photon and $b$-jet variables separately can enhance the significance for BM$_{\mathrm{H}}$. Projecting for an integrated luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$, we obtain a significance of 7.3 for BM$_{\mathrm{L}}$, while it drops to 3.1 for BM$_{\mathrm{H}}$. In the particular case of BM$_{\mathrm{L}}$, discovery level significance can be reached at 1.7 ab$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Modified Tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing confront with JUNO $\theta_{12}$ measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JUNO collaboration has realsed its first measurement of reactor neutrino oscillations results with $\sin^2\theta_{12} = 0.3092\pm 0.0087$ which improved the precision by a factor of 1.6 relative to the combination of all previous measurements. We confront the minimally modifred tri-bimaximal mixing pattern with the new data. Before the measurement of a non-zero $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle, the tri-bimximal mixing pattern predicting $\theta_{13}$ to be zero is one of the most popular simple ones. Modifications have been proposed to keep some features of tri-bimaximal mixing and make it to be consistent with data. One minimal scheme is to keep one of the coloums unchanged by modifing the neutrino mass matrix in models based on $A_4$ flavor symmetry. Three mixing patterms ermergy, a) the third, b) the second and c) the first column in the $3\times 3$ mixing matrix separately unchaged. The option a) mantains the feature that $\theta_{13}=0$ which is in conflect with data on $\theta_{13}$ and therefore is ruled out. The option b) is the interesting mixing pattern with $\theta_{13}$ nonzero, but predicts $V_{e2} = 1/\sqrt{3}$ with interesting predictions for CP violation and other mixing angles. The new $\theta_{12}$ value measured by JUNO with $|V_{e2}|$ is, however, smaller than $1/\sqrt{3}$ at a more than 3.5$\sigma$ level making the search for alternative new paterns desirable. The option c) predicts $V_{e2} = cos\alpha/\sqrt{3}$ which can also accommodate known data at a better than 1$\sigma$ level. This mixing pattern predicts $\sin^2\theta_{12} = 1-3\sin^2\theta_{13}$. The model favors inverted neutrino mass herarcy with CP violating variable $\sin \theta -0.84$ . Near future experiments can test the model.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic form factors: A window into the $D\Lambda_c$, $D^*\Lambda_c$, and $D\Lambda_c^*$ molecular structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal structure of exotic hadrons remains one of the most compelling puzzles in strong interaction physics. In this work, we provide crucial insights into the nature of doubly-charmed pentaquarks by investigating their electromagnetic properties. Using QCD light-cone sum rules, we present the first comprehensive calculation of the magnetic dipole moments of $D\Lambda_c$, $D^*\Lambda_c$, and $D\Lambda_c^*$ molecular pentaquarks with $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$, $\frac{3}{2}^-$, and $\frac{3}{2}^-$, respectively. Our analysis reveals a striking hierarchy of magnetic moments: $\mu_{D\Lambda_c^*} &gt; \mu_{D^*\Lambda_c} &gt; \mu_{D\Lambda_c}$, driven by distinct quark-level mechanisms. While light quarks dominate the overall response, we find that charm quark contributions become strategically important when light quark contributions partially cancel. Beyond dipole moments, we predict higher multipoles -- electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments -- that fingerprint the spatial deformation of these states, revealing prolate versus oblate charge distributions. These results provide the first systematic predictions for electromagnetic moments of molecular pentaquark configurations, establishing essential benchmarks for future theoretical and experimental studies. The distinctive patterns we uncover will enable quantitative comparisons with alternative structural models, ultimately helping to resolve the nature of doubly-charmed exotic hadrons.</description>

      <title>Probing quark-lepton correlation in GUTs with high-precision neutrino measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GUTs unify quarks and leptons into same representations and predict correlations between their masses and mixing. We take new data of JUNO and perform numerical scans to explore the flavor space compatible with data in SO(10) GUTs. The quark-lepton correlation shows the preference of normal ordering for light neutrino masses, predicts favored region of the CP-violating phase in neutrino oscillations, and classifies GUT models based their testability in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. The quark-lepton correlation predicts mass spectrum of right-handed neutrinos, pointing to the energy scale of baryon and lepton number violation and providing sources for baryogenesis. We emphasize that, as the high precision measurements of neutrino physics is coming, the quark-lepton correlation will provide increasingly important role in the testability of GUTs, complementary to the proton decay measurement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the landscape of models based on modular $S_4$ symmetry that predicts the trimaximal TM$_1$ mixing pattern for leptonic flavor mixing, and explores their parameter spaces with constraints from the latest high-precision measurement on $\theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m^2_{21}$ given by JUNO experiment. We review on how the mixing pattern arises from residual symmetries after the spontaneous breaking of a flavor symmetry, via an appropriate vacuum alignment of modular fields and flavon fields. We show three different models that realize the TM$_1$ in three approaches with the same symmetry structure. Due to different model building strategies used, predictions on the CP-violating phase and the effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay are different, making them distinguishable.</description>

      <title>Composite Asymmetric Dark Matter from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a cogenesis scenario for composite asymmetric dark matter framework: a dark sector has a similar strong dynamics to quantum chromodynamics in the standard model, and the dark-sector counterpart of baryons is the dark matter candidate. The Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes plays the role of a source of heavy scalar particles whose $CP$-violating decay into quarks and dark quarks provides particle--anti-particle asymmetries in baryons and dark matter, respectively. Primordial black holes should evaporate after the electroweak phase transition and before the big-bang nucleosynthesis for explaining the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and for consistent cosmology. We find that this scenario explains the observed values for both baryon and dark matter energy densities when the heavy scalar particles have a mass of $10^6 \text{--} 10^9\, \mathrm{GeV}$ and the primordial black holes have masses of $10^7 \text{--} 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$.</description>

      <title>High-frequency Gravitational Waves from Superstring Phases in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When moduli roll in the early universe, all physical scales - including string tensions - simultaneously evolve. The dynamics of cosmic string loops with time-varying tension can produce cosmic string loop trackers in which most of the energy density of the universe lies in the form of string loops. This solution can exist as an attractor until the rolling modulus reaches its minimum, when the loops ultimately decay through gravitational wave emission. We explore the spectrum of gravitational waves produced by such string loop trackers. The resulting spectrum is high-frequency and peaks in the GHz regime today. The amplitude of the signal is diluted by any subsequent matter-dominated epochs, and thus the potential observability of the signal crucially depends on the duration of the moduli-dominated epoch that follows once the moduli settle down and oscillate about their minimum.</description>

      <title>WIMP Freeze-out dynamics under Tsallis statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize thermal WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) freeze-out within Tsallis nonextensive statistics. Using Curado-Tsallis $q$-distributions $f_q(E;\mu,T)$ we compute $q$-deformed number and energy densities, pressure, entropy density and Hubble rate, $\{n_q,\rho_q,P_q,s_q,H_q\}$. The Boltzmann equation is generalized accordingly to obtain the comoving abundance $Y_{\chi,q}(x)$ and relic density $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ for a dark-matter candidate $\chi$ in a model-independent setup. The thermally averaged cross section is expanded as $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q \approx a + b\,\langle v_{\rm rel}^2\rangle_q$ up to $p$-wave. The freeze-out parameter $x_f(q)$ is determined from $\Gamma_{{\rm ann},q}(T_f)\simeq H_q(T_f)$ using a $q$-logarithmic inversion, with the expansion rate modified through ultra-relativistic rescalings $R_\rho(q)$ of the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $g_*$ and $g_{*s}$. We show that $x_f$ increases with $q$ and that QCD-threshold features propagate into $Y_{\chi,q}(x)$ and $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$. We then perform two $q$-grid scans: fixing $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$ while varying the dark-matter mass $m_\chi$, and fixing $m_\chi$ while varying the $s$-wave coefficient $a$. For an $s$-wave dominated scenario we construct $\chi^2$ profiles in these planes by comparing $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ with the Planck benchmark $\Omega_c h^2 = 0.120\pm 0.001$. In both cases we find a clear degeneracy in the preferred nonextensive parameter $q_{\rm best}$ along valleys in parameter space. However, fixed-mass scans (varying $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$) are significantly more constraining than fixed-cross-section scans, reflecting that $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ is mainly controlled by $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$, so that for realistic cross sections the best-fit $q_{\rm best}$ remains close to the extensive limit $q\to 1$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics provides a rigorous framework within which processes mediated by electroweak interactions can be calculated with great accuracy. By comparing with high-precision experimental measurements of the same processes, deviations from Standard Model predictions can be identified as indirect signals of new physics. In particular, electroweak precision fits combine multiple observables and provide a unique test of the Standard Model consistency at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>Cold Quark Matter: Renormalization group improvement of the perturbative series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss recent improvements of the cold and dense QCD pressure owing to an all-order resummation of the soft modes, or to the so-called renormalization group optimized perturbation theory (RGOPT). Both approaches show a significant improvement of the residual renormalization scale dependence with respect to the state-of-the-art results for the perturbative pressure.</description>

      <title>Search for Ultralight Dark Matter with Quantum Magnetometry in the Earth's Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axions and dark photons, are leading dark matter candidates. They may couple feebly to photons, sourcing oscillating electromagnetic signals in the presence of magnetic field. The Earth resonant cavity formed between the ground and the ionosphere provides a natural waveguide that can amplify such signals. We carry out a project aiming to search for new physics using the unshielded high-sensitivity atomic magnetometer, termed the Geomagnetic Probe for nEw physiCS (GPEX). In this work, we report our first search for axion and dark photon dark matter, conducted in the desert of XiaoDushan in Gansu Province, China. Analysis of the collection of one-hour data shows no evidence for axion- or dark photon-induced magnetic signals. Correspondingly, we set the constraints on the axion-photon coupling with $g_{a\gamma\gamma} &lt; 7\times10^{-10}\, \mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ and the dark photon kinetic-mixing parameter $\epsilon &lt; 2\times10^{-6}$ in the mass range $3.5 \times 10^{-16}\, \mathrm{eV} \sim 1.8 \times 10^{-14}\, \mathrm{eV}$. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ground-based quantum magnetic sensors for ultralight dark matter searches. Future networks of such detectors operating over extended periods could further enhance sensitivity, approaching the limits set by astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>KrkNLO matching and phenomenology for vector boson processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of NLO matrix elements with parton showers is indispensable for LHC physics. Differences between matching methods introduce matching uncertainties, corresponding to formally higher-order terms. We recently presented the process-independent generalisation of the KrkNLO method for NLO matching, which employs a modified PDF factorisation scheme to achieve NLO accuracy. With this factorisation scheme, the method can be used for colour-singlet final-states, and was previously implemented in the Herwig Monte Carlo Event Generator and applied to the diphoton-production process.
  Here we present the extension of the implementation of the KrkNLO method within Herwig to support the full class of applicable processes, using an external matrix-element library. We re-validate the implementation, and use it to study the NLO matching uncertainty for four vector-boson production processes at the LHC: $W$, $Z\gamma$, $WW$ and $ZZ$. We demonstrate that the KrkNLO method effectively eliminates the negative-weight problem in NLO event generation, across the four processes studied. We provide detailed comparisons between KrkNLO and variants of the MC@NLO method with different shower starting-scale choices, across processes and throughout phase-space, including double-differential observables. For each process, we compare the predictions to LHC data from ATLAS.</description>

      <title>Domain walls in the scaling regime: Equal Time Correlator and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls are topological defects that may have formed in the early Universe through the spontaneous breakdown of discrete symmetries, and can be a strong source of gravitational waves (GWs). We perform 3D lattice field theory simulations with CosmoLattice, considering grid sizes $N = 1250$, $2048$ and $4096$, to study the dynamics of the domain wall network and its GW signatures. We first analyze how the network approaches the scaling regime with a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ number of domain walls per Hubble volume, including setups with a large initial number of domains as expected in realistic scenarios, and find that scaling is always reached in a few Hubble times after the network formation. To better understand the properties of the scaling regime, we then numerically extract the Equal Time Correlator (ETC) of the energy-momentum tensor of the network, thus determining its characteristic shape for the case of domain walls, and verifying explicitly its functional dependence as predicted by scaling arguments. The ETC can be further extended to the Unequal Time Correlator (UTC) controlling the GW emission by making assumptions on the coherence of the source. By comparison with the actual GW spectrum evaluated by CosmoLattice, we are then able to infer the degree of coherence of the domain wall network. Finally, by performing numerical simulations in different background cosmologies, e.g. radiation domination and kination, we find evidence for a universal ETC at subhorizon scales and hence a universal shape of the GW spectrum in the UV, while the expansion history of the Universe may instead be determined by the IR features of the GW spectrum.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Neutrino Observation and Mass Measurement from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the next decade, $\mathcal{O}(100)$ diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) events are expected in Hyper-Kamiokande. Another neutrino source that has received far less attention is binary neutron star mergers. Including the data from recent simulations, we find that detection in current and near-future neutrino experiments is not feasible, and a megaton-scale detector with $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV threshold, such as the proposed Deep-TITAND, MEMPHYS, or MICA, will be required. This is due to the updated binary neutron star merger rate and the time-of-flight delay caused by the nonzero neutrino mass. Regarding the former, recent results from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has significantly lowered the upper limit on the neutron star merger rate. As for the latter, neutrino events from neutron star mergers are expected to be recorded shortly after the gravitational wave signal. Limiting the analysis to such short time windows can significantly reduce background rates. While this approach has been qualitatively discussed in the literature, the effect of the time delay caused by neutrino mass, which can substantially extend the observation windows, has been disregarded. We present a refined analysis employing energy-dependent time windows and luminosity distance cuts for the mergers and provide realistic estimates of the detector runtime required to record neutrinos from binary neutron star mergers with small background contamination. The relative timing between the neutrino and gravitational wave signals can also be employed to probe the scale of neutrino mass. We find that the sensitivity to the lightest neutrino mass exceeds both the most stringent terrestrial bounds from KATRIN and the projections based on galactic supernovae. This level of sensitivity may become particularly relevant in the future if terrestrial and supernova constraints are not significantly improved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LinApart2, a major update to the LinApart algorithm for univariate partial fraction decomposition. Unlike its predecessor, LinApart2 can handle denominators of arbitrary polynomial degree without explicit factorization, while retaining the efficiency and parallelizability of the Laurent series method. Benchmarks show substantial speedups in both runtime and memory usage compared to Mathematica's built-in routine Apart and to the Euclidean algorithm, enabling computations that were previously intractable.</description>

      <title>Holographic Constraints on the String Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that holography imposes strong and general constraints on scalar field potentials in the string landscape, determined by the asymptotic structure of the underlying spacetime. Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.</description>

      <title>How Bright in Gravitational Waves are Millisecond Pulsars for the Galactic Center GeV Gamma-Ray Excess? A Systematic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of dark matter (DM) is supported by various macroscopic observations, but its microscopic nature remains elusive. The Galactic Center GeV gamma-ray excess (GCE) has been a leading candidate signal for particle dark matter annihilation. However, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge provides the alternative explanation for the excess. Identifying these MSPs in electromagnetic bands is difficult due to source confusion, pulse broadening, and extinction. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a complementary probe: a steadily rotating, non-axisymmetric MSP emits a nearly monochromatic GW signal in the sensitive band of ground-based detectors, with amplitude set by its ellipticity. In this work, we systematically investigate the GW emission from the MSP population proposed to explain the GCE and its detectability with current and future detectors. We consider three major scenarios for the origin of ellipticity and model the population properties of these MSPs. We also consider both isolated MSPs and MSPs in binary systems, as well as Doppler effects in the detection. We find that while the signal is below the reach of current interferometers, next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) can detect a fraction of those MSPs, offering a novel test of the MSP interpretation of the GCE. Future directed searches toward the Galactic Center with continued improvements in sensitivities will either uncover this long-sought MSP population or place stringent limits on their ellipticities and abundance, with important implications for both the astrophysical and dark-matter interpretations of the GCE.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observational constraints on large-scale white noise (LSWN) in the cosmic density field, a phenomenon predicted to arise from non-linear mode coupling during cosmological evolution. Building on the theoretical framework of Paper I, where we demonstrated that non-linearities inevitably redistribute power from small to large scales through mode mixing, we confront these predictions with current cosmological data. We modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to incorporate a white noise component $k_\mathrm{BH}/k$ in the primordial power spectrum and perform parameter estimation using current cosmological data. The non-detection of excess power on the largest observable scales places stringent upper bounds: $k_\mathrm{BH} \leq 1.80 \times 10^{-13}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at 99\% confidence. These constraints imply the primordial power spectrum must deviate from perfect scale invariance on small scales, either through a cutoff at $k_{\mathrm{cut}} \lesssim 3~\mathrm{pc}^{-1}$ or through running of the spectral index with $\alpha_s \lesssim -0.015$. Our results demonstrate that LSWN provides a powerful probe of the primordial spectrum at scales orders of magnitude smaller than directly observable, offering unique constraints on early-universe physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical mechanics within the polymer quantization framework in the semiclassical regime. We apply a non-canonical transformation to the phase space variables. Then, we use this non-canonical transformation to calculate the deformed density of states of the $2n$-dimensional phase space, which encompasses all polymer effects. In the next step, some thermodynamic features of a system of $n$-dimensional harmonic oscillators are studied by computing the deformed partition function. The results show that the number of microstates decreases because there is an upper bound on the momentum within the polymer framework. We found that in the high-temperature regime, when the thermal de Broglie wavelength is close to the Planck length, $n$ degrees of freedom of the system are frozen in this setup. In other words, there is an effective reduction in space dimensions from $n$ to $\frac{n}{2}$ in the polymeric framework, which also signals the fractional dimension for odd-dimensional oscillators.</description>

      <title>Effects of New Forces on Scalar Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New long range forces acting on ordinary matter are highly constrained. However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on the Phenomenological Interacting Dark Energy Model with Fermi Gamma-Ray Bursts and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we constrain the phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) model using \emph{Fermi} gamma-ray burst (GRB) dataset and the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). Through a joint Bayesian analysis, we perform a cosmological comparative assessment of the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and CPL models with the phenomenological IDE model. For the phenomenological IDE model in a flat universe, we obtain: $\xi=2.644^{+1.144}_{-0.933}$, $\xi + 3w_X = -1.001^{+2.827}_{-3.153}$ with the GOLD sample ($z \geq 1.4$) and DESI DR2; and $\xi=2.879^{+0.995}_{-0.990}$, $\xi + 3w_X = 0.086^{+1.365}_{-1.440}$ with the FULL sample ($z \geq 1.4$) and DESI DR2. Our analysis shows that the $\Lambda$CDM model without interaction are consistent with the latest \emph{Fermi} sample and DESI DR2 at $1\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models in which a subcomponent of dark matter interacts with dark radiation have been proposed as a solution to the Hubble tension. In this framework, the interacting subcomponent of dark matter is in thermal equilibrium with the dark radiation in the early universe, but decouples from it around the time of matter-radiation equality. We study this general class of models and evaluate the quality of fit to recent cosmological data on the cosmic microwave background (from Planck 2018 and ACT DR6), baryon acoustic oscillations, large-scale structure, supernovae type Ia, and Cepheid variables. We focus on three benchmark scenarios that differ in the rate at which the dark matter decouples from the dark radiation, resulting in different patterns of dark acoustic oscillations. Fitting without ACT DR6 data, we find that all three scenarios significantly reduce the Hubble tension relative to $\Lambda$CDM, with an exponentially fast decoupling being the most preferred. The tension is reduced to less than $2 \, \sigma$ in fits that don't include the SH0ES collaboration results as part of the data and to less than $1 \, \sigma$ when these are included. When ACT DR6 data is included, the fit is significantly worsened. We find that the largest $H_0$ value at the $95 \%$ confidence region is $70.1$ km/s/Mpc without the SH0ES data, leading to only a mild reduction in the tension. This increases to $72.5$ km/s/Mpc, corresponding to a reduction in the tension to less than $3 \, \sigma$, if the SH0ES results are included in the fit.</description>

      <title>Generalized Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Models from Type IIA Intersecting D6-Branes</title>

Abstract: Generalizing three-family chiral fermion conditions to $I_{ac}=-(3+h)$ and $I_{ac'}=h$, with positive integer $h$, we extend the landscape of three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in a broader region. Differing from the former investigation with $I_{ac}=-3$ and $I_{ac'}=0$, we do not restrict that the $a$ stack of D6-branes must be parallel to the orientifold image of the $c$-stack along one of the three two-tori. In this investigation, without the simple parallel construction, we find four new classes of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models that are allowed by the extended three generation condition with $I_{ac}=3, I_{ac'}=-6$ and $I_{ac}=-1, I_{ac'}=-2$ through the intersections of $a$- and $c/c'$-branes. Moreover, with the $SU(2)'_{L}$ gauge coupling realized from $SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$ symmetry breaking, the canonical normalization requirement of the gauge kinetic term provides an alternative approach that can be imposed before the renormalization group equation evolution for $SU(2)'_L$ gauge coupling. This turns out to be an effective mechanism to realize the string-scale gauge coupling relation, especially for the new supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with large $g_b/g_a$ ratio. We show that this symmetry-breaking modified renormalization group evolution can highly suppress $g_b/g_a$, and finally realizes string-scale gauge coupling relations for the extended supersymmetric Pati-Salam models as well.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs Boson Phenomenology in the Dark Z mediated Fermionic Dark Matter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson $H^\pm$ appearing in a fermionic dark matter model mediated by an additional scalar doublet. In order to couple the dark matter fermion to the scalar doublet, we introduce a U(1)$_X$ gauge symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at electroweak symmetry breaking, resulting in a massive $Z'$ gauge boson. Since $Z'$ is generically light, the model is subject to strong constraints from electroweak precision observables. As a result, the charged Higgs boson mass allowed by current experimental bounds is typically light in this model, 110 GeV $&lt;m_{H^\pm}&lt;$ 170 GeV. Such a light charged Higgs boson will be produced mainly through top-quark decays at the LHC. Additionally, depending on the mass of the additional neutral Higgs boson $h$ and the dark gauge boson $Z'$, the direct production channels $pp \to H^\pm Z'$ and $pp \to H^\pm h$ can become sizable. We investigate the corresponding signal processes at the LHC to assess the discovery potential for $H^\pm$. Current ATLAS and CMS searches for light charged Higgs bosons already impose further constraints on the model. We also discuss the implications of dark matter in relation to the charged Higgs boson phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: This paper reports on the theoretical investigation of charged Higgs bosons and their coupling to fermions within the Two Higgs Doublet Model (THDM). The study focuses on the discovery potential of charged Higgs bosons predicted in Types III and IV at the future Circular Hadron-Hadron Collider (FCC-hh) with a center-of-mass energy of (\sqrt{s} = 100) TeV. By analyzing their decays, couplings to fermions, branching ratios, and production cross-section via (pp \rightarrow tH^-), we investigate the signatures of charged Higgs bosons, including kinematical distributions based on the background processes of (b\bar{b}) quarks.</description>

      <title>Probing Sub-eV Dark Photon, Scalar and Axion-like Particle Dark Matters with Transmon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate constraints of the transmon qubit, an improved version of the charge qubit, on bosonic light dark matters. Phonon excitations induced by the scattering or absorption of dark matter on a superconductor may destroy the Cooper pair, leading to the production of quasiparticles made by the electron. By measuring the production rate of the quasiparticle density, one may read out the coupling between dark matter and ordinary matter, assuming that these quasiparticles are solely induced by dark matter interactions. For the first time, we show constraints on the parameter space of the dark photon, light scalar dark matter, and axion-like particles from the measurement of quasiparticles in transmon qubit experiments. This study offers insights for the development of quantum qubit experiments aimed at the direct detection of dark matter in underground laboratories.</description>

Abstract: We review the method of the differential equations for the evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals. In particular, we focus on the series expansion approach for solving the system of differential equation and we discuss how to perform the analytical continuation of the result to entire (complex) phase-space. This approach allow us to consider arbitrary internal complex masses. This review is based on a lecture given by the author at the "Advanced School and Workshop on Multiloop Scattering Amplitudes" held in NISER, Bhubaneswar (India) in January 2024.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer by feebly interacting particles in supernovae: the trapping regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feebly interacting particles, such as sterile neutrinos, dark photons, and axions, can be abundantly produced in the proto-neutron star (PNS) formed in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). These particles can decay into photons or charged leptons, depositing energy outside the PNS. Strong bounds on new particles can thus be derived from the observed luminosity of CCSNe, with even tighter bounds obtained from low-energy SNe observations. For the first time we highlight that, at sufficiently large couplings, particle production \textit{outside} the PNS must also be considered. Using the prototypical case of axions coupling to two photons, we show that at large couplings the energy transfer from PNS to its surroundings is diffusive rather than ballistic, substantially reducing the deposited energy. Our findings have implications for the parameter space of particles probed in beam dump experiments and for dark matter models involving a sub-GeV mediator.</description>

      <title>Color superconductivity under neutron-star conditions at next-to-leading order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equation of state of deconfined strongly interacting matter at high densities remains an open question, with effects from quark pairing in the preferred color-flavor-locked (CFL) ground state possibly playing an important role. Recent studies suggest that at least large pairing gaps in the CFL phase are incompatible with current astrophysical observations of neutron stars. At the same time, it has recently been shown that in two-flavor quark matter, subleading corrections from pairing effects can be much larger than would be na\"ively expected, even for comparatively small gaps. In the present Letter, we compute next-to-leading-order corrections to the pressure of quark matter in the CFL phase arising from the gap and the strong coupling constant, incorporating neutron-star equilibrium conditions and current state-of-the-art perturbative QCD results. We find that the corrections are again quite sizable, and they allow us to constrain the CFL gap in the quark energy spectrum to $\Delta_{\rm CFL} \lesssim 140~{\rm MeV}$ at a baryon chemical potential $\mu_{\rm B} = 2.6~{\rm GeV}$, even when allowing for a wide range of possible behaviors for the dependence of the gap on the chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present methods to achieve NLL+NLO accurate parton showering for processes with two coloured legs: neutral- and charged-current Drell-Yan, and Higgs production in $pp$ collisions, as well as DIS and $e^+e^-$ to jets. The methods include adaptations of existing approaches, as well as a new NLO matching scheme, ESME, that is positive-definite by construction. Our implementations of the methods within the PanScales framework yield highly competitive NLO event generation speeds. We validate the fixed-order and combined resummation accuracy with tests in the limit of small QCD coupling and briefly touch on phenomenological comparisons to standard NLO results and to Drell-Yan data. The progress reported here is an essential step towards showers with logarithmic accuracy beyond NLL for processes with incoming hadrons.</description>

      <title>Leading bounds on micro- to picometer fifth forces from neutron star cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equivalence principle and the inverse-square law of gravity could be violated at short distances ($10^{-6}$ to $10^{-12}$ meters) by scalars sporting a coupling $g_N$ to nucleons and mass $\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_\phi\lesssim\rm MeV$. We show for the first time that stringent bounds on the existence of these scalars can be derived from the observed cooling of nearby isolated neutron stars (NSs). Although NSs can only be used to set limits comparable to the classic SN 1987A cooling bound in the case of pseudoscalars such as the QCD axion, the shallow temperature dependence of the scalar emissivity results in a huge enhancement in the effect of $\phi$ on the cooling of cold NSs. As we do not find evidence of exotic energy losses, we can exclude couplings down to $g_N\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-14}$. Our new bound supersedes all existing limits on scalars across six orders of magnitude in $m_\phi$. These conclusions also extend to Higgs-portal models, for which the bound on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle is $\sin\theta\lesssim 6\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the matching between the two most popular effective field theories for beyond standard model Higgs physics, SMEFT and HEFT. To perform this matching we follow the approach of identifying the corresponding scattering amplitudes for physical processes in both theories, instead of the most usual approach of relating the corresponding effective Lagrangians or effective actions. In this work we focus on the physical processes of double and triple Higgs production from weak boson fusion, in particular, $WW \to HH$, $ZZ \to HH$, $WW \to HHH$ and $ZZ \to HHH$ and complement them with the elastic scattering $HH \to HH$. We present here the analytical solution to this matching in terms of relations among the coefficients in both theories and comment on the most relevant phenomenological implications of such relations for collider physics.</description>

      <title>On Focusing Statistical Power for Searches and Measurements in Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle physics experiments rely on the (generalised) likelihood ratio test (LRT) for searches and measurements, which consist of composite hypothesis tests. However, this test is not guaranteed to be optimal, as the Neyman-Pearson lemma pertains only to simple hypothesis tests. Any choice of test statistic thus implicitly determines how statistical power varies across the parameter space. An improvement in the core statistical testing methodology for general settings with composite tests would have widespread ramifications across experiments. We discuss an alternate test statistic that provides the data analyzer an ability to focus the power of the test on physics-motivated regions of the parameter space. We demonstrate the improvement from this technique compared to the LRT on a Higgs $\rightarrow\tau\tau$ dataset simulated by the ATLAS experiment and a dark matter dataset inspired by the LZ experiment. We also employ machine learning to efficiently perform the Neyman construction, which is essential to ensure statistically valid confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Tests of BSM Higgs interactions by the combination $(\kappa_V^2-\kappa_{2V})$ in HHjj production at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the potential of analyzing the particular combination of $\kappa$ modifiers given by $\kappa_V^2-\kappa_{2V}$ to disentangle Beyond Standard Model Higgs signals in double Higgs production with two extra light jets at LHC. We use the Higgs Effective Field Theory approach, HEFT, for the gauge invariant description of these two $\kappa_V$ and $\kappa_{2V}$ parameters representing the BSM interactions of the Higgs particle with the electroweak gauge bosons, $HVV$ and $HHVV$ respectively. We illustrate the bonus of studying this particular combination $\kappa_V^2-\kappa_{2V}$ focusing in just one process, $HHjj$, instead of studying $\kappa_V$ and $\kappa_{2V}$ separately using various processes. For the detailed analysis here, we focus on the particular final state $H(\to \gamma \gamma) H (\to b \bar b)jj'$, with two photons, two b-jets and two light jets, which we analyze fully including parton showering, fragmentation, hadronization and detector effects, in both signal and main background. We find that the sensitivity to $\kappa_V^2-\kappa_{2V}$ could be notably improved at the HL-LHC by the proper cuts on the final state $b \bar b \gamma \gamma jj'$ that select optimally the events with VBF-topology and $HH$-topology. In particular, we propose strategies based on a good isolation of $\gamma \gamma$ and b-jet pairs, and focus specially on specific variables like $\eta_{\gamma \gamma}$ and $P^T_{\gamma \gamma}$ where the signal events distributions may efficiently discriminate between BSM signal versus SM background. We will show here how the high transversality of these two pairs in the signal (inherited from the high transversality of the $H$'s) is correlated with the non-vanishing value of this $(\kappa_V^2-\kappa_{2V})$ combination.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Mass-Driven Instabilities as the Earliest Flavor Conversion in Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small antineutrino flux of opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these "flipped" neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.</description>

Using the bootstrap model [Phys.Rev.C 110 (2024) 2, 025501] as a prior, we incorporate recent experimental data, as well as older measurements in the deep inelastic scattering region, to derive a re-optimized posterior model. We examine the impact of these new inputs on model predictions and associated uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the resulting cross-section predictions in the kinematic range relevant to the Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE experiments.</description>

      <title>On the Standard Model Mass Spectrum and Interactions In the Holomorphic Unified Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified, ultraviolet-finite framework for the full Standard Model particle mass spectrum based on the Holomorphic Unified Field Theory augmented by nonlocal entire-function regulators. Starting from a single holomorphic action on the complexified spacetime manifold \( M^4_{\mathbb{C}} \), with a Hermitian metric unifying gravity, gauge, and matter sectors, we embed exponential regulator insertions to render all loop integrals finite without breaking gauge or diffeomorphism invariance. After spontaneous breaking of the electroweak and grand unified symmetries, analytic expressions for the charged lepton, quark, and neutrino mass matrices are derived in terms of holomorphic Yukawa textures and regulator form factors. A minimal Froggatt-Nielsen flavon sector fixes all \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) coefficients in terms of two continuous inputs. Regulator-suppressed one- and two-loop renormalization group evolution then yields predictions for all fermion masses, CKM and PMNS mixing angles, \( W \) and \( Z \) boson masses, and the Higgs boson mass and self-couplings. Finally, we show that gauge coupling unification, three chiral families, hypercharge quantization, and the shape of the Higgs potential are genuine predictions of the holomorphic nonlocal framework.</description>

      <title>Blast-Wave-Tsallis-Power model for hadrons $p_{\rm T}$-spectra and elliptic flow $v_2$ in identical nuclei collisions at energies available at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of the phenomenological Blast-Wave-Tsallis-Power model, recently proposed by the author for the hadrons transverse momentum ($p_\textrm{T}$) spectra measured at the LHC, is developed to also describe the hadrons $p_\textrm{T}$-differential elliptic flow coefficients $v_2$ in identical nuclei collisions of different centralities. The model describes well the available data on $p_\textrm{T}$-spectra and $v_2$ for any $p_\textrm{T}$ of various particles, from pions to charmonia, in Pb--Pb at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 2.76 and 5.02~TeV, and in Xe--Xe at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 5.44~TeV. Also, predictions for OO collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 5.36~TeV are given. While the model is mainly targeting the LHC energies, it also works at much lower RHIC energies.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Unruh effect for neutrinos interacting with accelerated matter"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present comment, we show that the fundamental equation worked by Dvornikov in his paper, which is the Dirac equation for a massive neutrino interacting with linearly accelerated matter, is incorrect. In particular, Dvornikov incorrectly wrote/defined the effective external current in a curved space-time. In other words, Dvornikov wrote/defined such an effective current in a flat space-time, which is a mistake. Consequently, the second-order differential equation (generated through the quadratic Dirac equation) in your paper is incorrect, where such an equation is given by the Whittaker equation. So, since the solutions of such a differential equation (whose solutions are the Whittaker functions) are the basis for its results, it implies that such results are also incorrect. In this way, starting from the true/correct Dirac equation with an effective external current in a curved space-time, we obtain in detail the second-order differential equation (also a Whittaker equation) and its solutions for a neutrino interacting with linearly accelerated matter.</description>

      <title>Mass and Decay-Constant Evolution of Heavy Quarkonia and $B_c$ States from Thermal QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the thermal behavior of heavy vector and axial-vector mesons ($J/\psi$, $\Upsilon$, and $B_c$) within the finite-temperature QCD sum-rule framework. Using updated PDG-2024 quark masses, modern lattice-informed gluon condensates, and a temperature-dependent continuum threshold constrained by vacuum stability, we compute the evolution of the masses $m(T)$ and decay constants $f(T)$ up to $T/T_c \lesssim 0.9$. At $T=0$ the sum rules are calibrated to reproduce the experimental and LHCb masses and reference decay constants within the expected $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ accuracy of a leading-order $+$ $D{=}4$ analysis, and we interpret the subsequent finite-temperature evolution as a genuine prediction of the framework.
  Near the critical temperature, the relative suppression follows a clear hierarchy $\Upsilon &lt; J/\psi &lt; B_c$, consistent with their binding energies and lattice spectral trends. The predicted $1P$--$1S$ splitting for the $B_c$ system, $0.477~\mathrm{GeV}$, matches the LHCb observation of orbitally excited $B_c^{+}$ states. The results provide a coherent finite-temperature baseline for future extensions including radiative, higher-dimensional, and width effects.</description>

      <title>Constraining the four-light quark operators in the SMEFT with multijet and VBF processes at linear level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the interference of the SM with ten four-light quark operators in the SMEFT can be constrained thanks to multijet and $Z,W,\gamma$ VBF production in association with jets. The differential distributions for each process are generated at LO for different jet multiplicities, that are then merged and showered. We check which observables provide better bounds on the Wilson coefficients, and what directions in the ten-dimensional coefficient space they are able to probe. We discuss the relevance of the quadratic contributions with respect to the linear terms.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory approach to neutrino oscillations in dark matter and implications at JUNO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation is a significant physical process worthy of in-depth exploration. In this paper, we investigate the matter effect of massive neutrinos in a scalar-type ultra-light dark matter and calculate the neutrino oscillation probability using the quantum field theory method. The result reveals that the neutrino oscillation probability derived from the quantum field theory approach exhibits no additional time dependence, which marks the most significant distinction from the oscillation result obtained through the quantum mechanics method. Furthermore, we discuss predictions of the Juno experiment regarding neutrino oscillation behavior in scalar-type ultra-light dark matter. This study extends the understanding of the interaction between neutrinos and dark matter, which warrants further exploration.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang--Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang--Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang--Mills fields is defined. It is then provided by the Aharonov--Bohm effect induced by the concatenation of the compact chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fluxes originated by the topology changes. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations, stabilize the chromo-magnetic vortices. Finally, we observe that dimensional transmutation for the Yang-Mills fields can be derived from the scaling property of the geometric part of the stochastic flow. Specifically, a relation that involves the infrared equilibrium limit of the Planck constant can be derived that yields the correct order of magnitude for $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.</description>

      <title>Digit quantum simulation of a fermion field in an expanding universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a rapidly evolving tool with great potential for research at the frontiers of physics, and is particularly suited to be used in computationally intensive lattice simulations, such as problems with non-equilibrium. In this work, a basic scenario, namely free fermions in an expanding universe, is considered and quantum simulations are used to perform the evolution and study the phenomena involved. Using digital quantum simulations with the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter expansion, the evolutions of fermion number density, correlation functions, polarization, and chiral condensation are analyzed. A spread out phenomenon can be observed in the simulation, which is a consequence of momentum redshift. This work also demonstrates the simplicity and convenience of using quantum simulations when studying time-evolution problems.</description>

      <title>Sakai-Sugimoto Model in an Off-Shell: Chiral Lagrangian to All Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sakai-Sugimoto holographic model is famous for implementing the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD and reproducing the Chiral Lagrangian in a top-down approach. In this manuscript, we revisit the model in a formalism that is somewhat different from the original work by Sakai and Sugimoto: We start by identifying boundary degrees of freedom and splitting the bulk equations of motion into dynamical ones and constraints. The former are then solved to all orders in derivatives of the boundary fields. The constraints are left unsolved, leaving the dynamical degrees of freedom off-shell. This approach enables us to systematically derive the effective action of the boundary theory. The derived effective action is very rich in physics: it contains an $U(N_f)$ multiplet of massless pseudoscalars interacting (via trilinear and higher terms) with towers of massive (axial-)vector mesons. In contrast to the previous studies, our effective action is non-local. The original Chiral Lagrangian is recovered as its local expansion in small $\pi$-meson momenta (derivative expansion). We particularly zoom in on the values of four derivative terms couplings, the low energy constants, and compare those with the ones reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>A generalized study of linear electromagnetic cascades in astrophysical sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays can trigger electromagnetic cascades via pair production on ambient photons, reprocessing their energy to lower frequencies. A classic example is the cascade from the gamma rays produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in extragalactic photon fields, whose universal spectral shape was first described by Berezinsky in the 1970s. Recently, internal cascades, developing within the gamma-ray sources themselves, have gained a prominent role, as the IceCube data suggest that most detected neutrinos originate in gamma-ray-opaque environments. We analyze under what conditions these internal cascades can approach a universal spectrum. Since the Berezinsky treatment breaks down if synchrotron losses dominate, we present a generalized theory incorporating synchrotron-dominated cascades. We show the emergence of universal cascade spectrum among various examples of high-energy sources containing non-thermal cosmic rays, and discuss the conditions for its appearance.</description>

      <title>Morphology of Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectra imprinted by a Sequence of Post-Inflationary Epochs $via$ ${\rm GWInSpect}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w&lt;1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\rm GW}&lt;0$), while a stiff EoS ($w&gt;1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}&gt;0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.</description>
