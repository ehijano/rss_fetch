      <title>Low temperature ferroelectric state in strontium titanate microcrystals using in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strontium titanate is a classic quantum paraelectric oxide material that has been widely studied in bulk and thin films. It exhibits a well-known cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105 K, characterized by the rotation of oxygen octahedra. A possible second phase transition at lower temperature is suppressed by quantum fluctuations, preventing the onset of ferroelectric order. However, recent studies have shown that ferroelectric order can be established at low temperatures by inducing strain and other means. Here, we used in situ multi-reflection Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to measure the strain and rotation tensors for two strontium titanate microcrystals at low temperature. We observe strains induced by dislocations and inclusion-like impurities in the microcrystals. Based on radial magnitude plots, these strains increase in magnitude and spread as the temperature decreases. Pearson's correlation heatmaps show a structural transition at 50 K, which we associate with the formation of a low-temperature ferroelectric phase in the presence of strain. We do not observe any change in local strains associated with the tetragonal phase transition at 105 K.</description>

      <title>When More Data Hurts: Optimizing Data Coverage While Mitigating Diversity Induced Underfitting in an Ultra-Fast Machine-Learned Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are becoming an essential tool in materials modeling. However, optimizing the generation of training data used to parameterize the MLIPs remains a significant challenge. This is because MLIPs can fail when encountering local enviroments too different from those present in the training data. The difficulty of determining \textit{a priori} the environments that will be encountered during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation necessitates diverse, high-quality training data. This study investigates how training data diversity affects the performance of MLIPs using the Ultra-Fast Force Field (UF$^3$) to model amorphous silicon nitride. We employ expert and autonomously generated data to create the training data and fit four force-field variants to subsets of the data. Our findings reveal a critical balance in training data diversity: insufficient diversity hinders generalization, while excessive diversity can exceed the MLIP's learning capacity, reducing simulation accuracy. Specifically, we found that the UF$^3$ variant trained on a subset of the training data, in which nitrogen-rich structures were removed, offered vastly better prediction and simulation accuracy than any other variant. By comparing these UF$^3$ variants, we highlight the nuanced requirements for creating accurate MLIPs, emphasizing the importance of application-specific training data to achieve optimal performance in modeling complex material behaviors.</description>

      <title>Systematic discovery of new nano-scale metastable intermetallic eutectic phases in laser rapid solidified Aluminum-Germanium alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser surface remelting of as-cast Al-Ge eutectic alloy is shown to produce ultrafine lamellar eutectic morphology with interlamellar spacing refined up to ~60 nm and composed of FCC Al solid solution and unusual AlxGey intermetallic phases that do not form during near-equilibrium solidification. The microstructures are characterized and analyzed using a combination of selected area electron diffraction, high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to obtain high-resolution elemental maps, and atomistic modeling using density functional theory followed by atomic-scale image simulation. Depending on the local solidification conditions, the crystallography of the AlxGey intermetallic phases in the eutectic microstructure is either monoclinic (C 2/c) or monoclinic (P 21), with high densities of defects in both cases. This is in sharp contrast to the as-cast alloys that showed nominally pure Al and Ge phases with significant solute partitioning and equilibrium FCC and diamond cubic crystal structures, respectively. Corresponding kinetic phase diagrams are proposed to interpret the evolution of nano-lamellar eutectic morphologies with equilibrium Al and metastable AlxGey phases, and to explain increased solid solubility in the Al phases manifested by precipitation of ultrafine clusters of Ge. The reasons for the formation of these metastable eutectics under laser rapid solidification are discussed from the perspective of the competitive growth criterion.</description>

      <title>Tuned ionic mobility by Ultrafast-laser pulses in Black Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly non-equilibrium conditions in femtosecond-laser excited solids cause a variety of ultrafast phenomena that are not accessible by thermal conditions, like sub-picosecond solid-to-liquid or solid-to-solid phase transitions. In recent years the microscopic pathways of various laser-induced crystal rearrangements could be identified and led to novel applications and/or improvements in optoelectronics, photonics, and nanotechnology. However, it remains unclear what effect a femtosecond-laser excitation has on ionic impurities within an altered crystal environment, in particular on the atomic mobility. Here, we performed ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations on laser-excited black silicon, a promising material for high-efficient solar cells, using the Code for Highly excIted Valence Electron Systems (CHIVES). By computing time-dependent Bragg peak intensities for doping densities of 0.16% and 2.31% we could identify the overall weakening of the crystal environment with increasing impurity density. The analysis of Si-S bond angles and lengths after different excitation densities, as well as computing interatomic forces allowed to identify a change in ion mobility with increasing impurity density and excitation strength. Our results indicate the importance of impurity concentrations for ionic mobility in laser-excited black silicon and could give significant insight for semiconductor device optimization and materials science advancement.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Multislice Electron Ptychography to Point Defects: A Case Study in SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust atomic resolution structural characterization of point defects in 3D is a longstanding challenge for electron microscopy. Here, we evaluate multislice electron ptychography as a tool to carry out 3D atomic resolution characterization of point defects in silicon carbide as a model. Through multislice electron scattering simulations, subsequent ptychographic reconstructions, and data analysis, we show that intrinsic defects such as vacancies and substitutions beyond transition metals can be detected with a depth precision of approximately 0.1 nm with realistic sample and microscope conditions. Furthermore, the dependence of contrast at defect sites on electron energy and dose, as well as optimal acquisition parameters, are described. Overall, these results serve as a guidepost to experiments aiming to analyze point defects beyond extremely thin specimens or only heavy elements.</description>

      <title>Rapid Assessment of Stable Crystal Structures in Single Phase High Entropy Alloys Via Graph Neural Network Based Surrogate Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an effort to develop a rapid, reliable, and cost-effective method for predicting the structure of single-phase high entropy alloys, a Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN-FF) based approach was introduced. This method was successfully tested on 132 different high entropy alloys, and the results were analyzed and compared with density functional theory and valence electron concentration calculations. Additionally, the effects of various factors, including lattice parameters and the number of supercells with unique atomic configurations, on the prediction accuracy were investigated. The ALIGNN-FF based approach was subsequently used to predict the structure of a novel cobalt-free 3d high entropy alloy, and the result was experimentally verified.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Engineering of Lattice Dynamics and Elastic Constants of 2D Layered Nanomaterials under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer coupling in two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials can provide us novel strategies to evoke their superior properties, such as the exotic flat bands and unconventional superconductivity of twisted layers, the formation of moir\'e excitons and related nontrivial topology. However, to accurately quantify interlayer potential and further measure elastic properties of 2D materials remains vague, despite significant efforts. Herein, the layer-dependent lattice dynamics and elastic constants of 2D nanomaterials have been systematically investigated via pressure-engineering strategy based on ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy. The shearing mode and layer-breathing Raman shifts of MoS2 with various thicknesses were analyzed by the linear chain model. Intriguingly, it was found that the layer-dependent d{\omega}/dP of shearing and breathing Raman modes display the opposite trends, quantitatively consistent with our molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. These results can be generalized to other van der Waals systems, and may shed light on the potential applications of 2D materials in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic topological Weyl fermions in half-metallic In$_2$CoSe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSM) have recently attracted much attention due to their potential in realizing strong anomalous Hall effects. Yet, how to design such systems remains unclear. Based on first-principles calculations, we show here that the ferromagnetic half-metallic compound In$_2$CoSe$_4$ has several pairs of Weyl points and is hence a good candidate for magnetic WSM. These Weyl points would approach the Fermi level gradually as the Hubbard $U$ increases, and finally disappear after a critical value $U_c$. The range of the Hubbard $U$ that can realize the magnetic WSM state can be expanded by pressure, manifesting the practical utility of the present prediction. Moreover, by generating two surface terminations at Co or In atom after cleaving the compound at the Co-Se bonds, the nontrivial Fermi arcs connecting one pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality are discovered in surface states. Furthermore, it is possible to observe the nontrivial surface state experimentally, e.g., angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. As such, the present findings imply strongly a new magnetic WSM which may host a large anomalous Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Large-scale database analysis of anomalous thermal conductivity of quasicrystals and its application to thermal diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One long-standing and crucial issues in the study of quasicrystals has been to identify the physical properties characteristic of quasicrystals. The large positive temperature coefficient of thermal conductivity at temperatures above room temperature, which has been observed in several quasicrystals, is one such characteristic property. Here, we show that this is indeed a very distinct property of quasicrystals through analysis using a large physical property database "Starrydata". In fact, several quasicrystals ranked nearly first among more than 10,000 samples of various materials (metallic alloys, semiconductors, ceramics, etc.) in terms of the magnitude of the positive temperature coefficient of thermal conductivity. This unique property makes quasicrystals ideal for use in composite thermal diodes. We searched the database for the most suitable materials that can be combined with quasicrystals to create high-performance composite thermal diodes. Analytical calculations using a simple one-dimensional model showed that by selecting the optimal material, a thermal rectification ratio of 3.2 can be obtained. Heat transfer simulations based on the finite element method confirmed that this can be achieved under realistic conditions. This is the highest value of the thermal rectification ratio reported to date for this type of thermal diode.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of electronic and magnetic properties of Fe atoms on Cu2N/Cu(100)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles calculations were conducted to investigate the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of single Fe atoms and Fe dimers on Cu2N/Cu(100). Upon adsorption of an Fe atom onto Cu2N/Cu(100), robust Fe-N bonds form, resulting in the incorporation of both single Fe atoms and Fe dimers within the surface Cu2N layer. The partial occupancy of Fe-3d orbitals lead to large spin moments on the Fe atoms. Interestingly, both single Fe atoms and Fe dimers exhibit in-plane magnetic anisotropy, with the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of an Fe dimer exceeding twice that of a single Fe atom. This magnetic anisotropy can be attributed to the predominant contribution of the component along the x direction of the spin-orbital coupling Hamiltonian. Additionally, the formation of Fe-Cu dimers may further boost the magnetic anisotropy, as the energy levels of the Fe-3d orbitals are remarkably influenced by the presence of Cu atoms. Our study manifests the significance of uncovering the origin of magnetic anisotropy in engineering the magnetic properties of magnetic nanostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring intrinsic magnetic topological insulators (TIs) for next-generation spintronic devices is still challenging in recent years. Here, we present a theoretical investigation on the electronic, magnetic and topological properties of monolayer (ML) Janus MnBi2TexSe4-x, derived from two trivial magnetic semiconductors ML MnBi2Se4 and MnBi2Te4. Our band structure analysis reveals that two out of the eight Janus structures exhibit band inversion induced by spin-orbit coupling. These structures are confirmed to have nonzero integer Chern numbers, indicating their topological nature. Moreover, the topological state is robust under moderate biaxial strains. Interestingly, applying compressive strain results in a high Chern number of 2 and enhances their magnetic stability at elevated temperatures. Our findings offer an effective strategy to engineer magnetic TI states within the ML MnBi2Te4 family.</description>

      <title>THz Second and Third Harmonic Generation in PdCoO$_2$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz high harmonic generation (THz HHG) is a common property of nonlinear systems. Recently it has been used to investigate fundamental principles that govern transport and nonlinear dynamics in novel quantum materials like graphene, Dirac semimetals or high-temperature superconductors. Here, we report on the observation of exceptionally large THz second harmonic and third harmonic generation in thin films of the highly conducting delafossite PdCoO$_2$ down to low temperatures. The growth of this material on offcut substrate allows for a significant enhancement of the third harmonic intensity compared to ordinary $c$-axis grown thin films. Furthermore, it appears to be a necessity for the observation of THz second harmonic generation. We model the temperature dependence of the third harmonic generation by means of Boltzmann transport theory and provide an explanation for the second harmonic generation by comparing the system to the electric field induced second harmonic generation. The present investigation thus provides an important contribution to the ongoing discussion of low temperature origins of THz HHG and might serve as a new platform for THz high harmonic applications.</description>

      <title>The effect of local distortions on magnetic and magnetoelectric properties of paramagnetic Pr3Ga5SiO14 langasite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field-induced electric polarization has been observed in trigonal non-centrosymmetric paramagnetic Pr3Ga5SiO14 langasite. We detected quadratic electric polarization along the a-axis in the basal ab plane for various magnetic-field orientations. Electric polarization along the c-axis is only evident starting from the fourth power of magnetic field, in accordance with the trigonal symmetry. The magnetic properties of Pr3Ga5SiO14 primarily stem from the local anisotropic magnetic moment of the two lowest Pr3+ singlets (quasi-doublet) in the crystal electric field. The random distribution of Ga/Si in the 2d positions leads to a local distortion of C2 symmetry and to a splitting distribution of the quasi-doublet. By considering the interactions of local moments among different Pr3+ positions within a phenomenological approach for the allowed magnetoelectric coupling, we derive the electric polarization in terms of symmetry-allowed combinations of local magnetic susceptibilities and field components. The magnetic field dependence of electric polarization in the basal plane, P_{a,b*}, is mainly determined by the accumulation of effective local susceptibilities, exhibiting similar behavior in low fields, while polarization along the c-axis, P_c, arises from the non-equivalence of local effective magnetic susceptibilities in different Pr3+ positions. Our findings suggest that the temperature dependencies of magnetic and magnetoelectric susceptibilities are highly sensitive to the distribution of the quasi-doublet splitting, which reflects the local symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Controllable magnetic anisotropy and ferroelasticity in superconducting FeSe monolayer with surface fluorine adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable magnetization in atomically thin two-dimensional magnets is highly desirable for developing spintronics. For FeSe monolayer, its magnetic ground state is not yet fully understood, and the potential in constructing high-speed and advanced devices remains unknown. Using density functional theory calculations, we confirm the spin ordering of monolayer FeSe to be dimer texture. With Fluorine (F) adsorption (F/FeSe), the system exhibits a coverage dependent magnetic anisotropy and multiferroicity which can be attributable to the Jahn-Teller effect, being the benefit to potential spintronic applications. Intriguingly, an inherent coupling between magnetism and ferroelasticity in the most energetically favorable F/FeSe system is proposed. Our study thus not only provides a promising way to control the spintronic properties and construct multiferroics, but also renders F/FeSe an ideal platform for magnetism studies and practical high-performance multifunctional devices.</description>

      <title>Controlled Growth of large area bilayer MoS$_2$ films on SiO$_2$ substrates by chemical vapour deposition technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer (2L) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have the ability to host interlayer excitons, where electron and hole parts are spatially separated that leads to much longer lifetime as compared to direct excitons. This property can be utilized for the development of exciton-based logic devices, which are supposed to be superior in terms of energy efficiency and optical communication compatibility as compared to their electronic counterparts. However, obtaining uniformly thick bilayer epitaxial films with large area coverage is challenging. Here, we have engineered the flow pattern of the precursors over the substrate surface to obtain large area (mm2) covered strictly bilayer MoS$_2$ films on SiO$_2$ by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique without any plasma treatment of the substrate prior to the growth. Bilayer nature of these films is confirmed by Raman, low-frequency Raman, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photoluminescence (PL) studies. The uniformity of the film has been checked by Raman peak separation and PL intensity map. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals that crystalline and twisted bilayer islands coexist within the layer. Back gated field-effect transistor (FET) structures fabricated on the bilayers show on/off ratio of 10^6 and subthreshold swings (SS) of 2.5 V/Decade.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient multi-fidelity training for high-fidelity machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are used to estimate potential energy surfaces (PES) from ab initio calculations, providing near quantum-level accuracy with reduced computational costs. However, the high cost of assembling high-fidelity databases hampers the application of MLIPs to systems that require high chemical accuracy. Utilizing an equivariant graph neural network, we present an MLIP framework that trains on multi-fidelity databases simultaneously. This approach enables the accurate learning of high-fidelity PES with minimal high-fidelity data. We test this framework on the Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl and In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N systems. The computational results indicate that geometric and compositional spaces not covered by the high-fidelity meta-gradient generalized approximation (meta-GGA) database can be effectively inferred from low-fidelity GGA data, thus enhancing accuracy and molecular dynamics stability. We also develop a general-purpose MLIP that utilizes both GGA and meta-GGA data from the Materials Project, significantly enhancing MLIP performance for high-accuracy tasks such as predicting energies above hull for crystals in general. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the present multi-fidelity learning is more effective than transfer learning or $\Delta$-learning an d that it can also be applied to learn higher-fidelity up to the coupled-cluster level. We believe this methodology holds promise for creating highly accurate bespoke or universal MLIPs by effectively expanding the high-fidelity dataset.</description>

      <title>Evolution of flat bands in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ moir\'e lattices: A study combining machine learning and band unfolding methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e lattices have served as the ideal quantum simulation platform for exploring novel physics due to the flat electronic bands resulting from the long wavelength moir\'e potentials. However, the large sizes of this type of system challenge the first-principles methods for full calculations of their electronic structures, thus bringing difficulties in understanding the nature and evolution of the flat bands. In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of moir\'e patterns of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ by combining ab initio and machine learning methods. We find that a flat band with a bandwidth of about 5 meV emerges below the valence band edge at the K point for the H-stacking at a twist angle of 3.89$^{\circ}$. Then, it shifts dramatically as the twist angle decreases and becomes about 20 meV higher than the valence band maximum for the twist angle of 3.15$^{\circ}$. Multiple ultra-flat bands emerge as the twist angle is reduced to 1.7$^{\circ}$. Band unfolding reveals that the ultra-flat bands formed by the $\Gamma$ and K valleys show distinct behaviors. The $\Gamma$-valley flat bands are sensitive to the interlayer coupling, thus experiencing dramatic changes as the twist angle decreases. In contrast, the K-valley flat band, which shows a weak dependence on the interlayer coupling, is mainly modulated by the long wavelength moir\'e potential. Therefore, a relatively small angle (2.13$^{\circ}$) is required to generate the K-valley flat band, which experiences a transition from the honeycomb to the triangular lattice as the twist angle decreases.</description>

      <title>Threshold displacement energies in refractory high-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys show promising resistance to irradiation, yet little is known about the fundamental nature of radiation-induced defect formation. Here, we simulate threshold displacement energies in equiatomic MoNbTaVW using an accurate machine-learned interatomic potential, covering the full angular space of crystal directions. The effects of local chemical ordering is assessed by comparing results in randomly ordered and short-range-ordered MoNbTaVW. The average threshold displacement energy in the random alloy is $44.3 \pm 0.15$ eV and slightly higher, $48.6 \pm 0.15$ eV, in the short-range-ordered alloy. Both are significantly lower than in any of the constituent pure metals. We identify the mechanisms of defect creation and find that they are mainly dependent on the masses of the recoiling and colliding elements. Low thresholds are generally found when heavy atoms (W, Ta) displace and replace the lightest atoms (V). The average threshold energies when separated by recoiling element are consequently ordered inversely according to their mass, opposite to the trend in the pure metals where W has by far the highest thresholds. However, the trend in the alloy is reversed when considering the cross sections for defect formation in electron irradiation, due to the mass-dependent recoil energies from the electrons.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Accelerating Nanomaterials Synthesis Using Machine Learning Featurization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving for the complex conditions of materials synthesis and processing requires analyzing information gathered from multiple modes of characterization. Currently, quantitative information is extracted serially with manual tools and intuition, constraining the feedback cycle for process optimization. We use machine learning to automate and generalize feature extraction for in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) data to establish quantitatively predictive relationships in small sets ($\sim$10) of expert-labeled data, and apply these to save significant time on subsequent epitaxially grown samples. The fidelity of these relationships is tested on a representative material system ($W_{1-x}V_xSe2$ growth on c-plane sapphire substrate (0001)) at two stages of synthesis with two aims: 1) predicting the grain alignment of the deposited film from the pre-growth substrate surface data, and 2) estimating the vanadium (V) dopant concentration using in-situ RHEED as a proxy for ex-situ methods (e.g. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Both tasks are accomplished using the same set of materials agnostic core features, eliminating the need to retrain for specific systems and leading to a potential 80\% time saving over a 100 sample synthesis campaign. These predictions provide guidance for recipe adjustments to avoid doomed trials, reduce follow-on characterization, and improve control resolution for materials synthesis, ultimately accelerating materials discovery and commercial scale-up.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Interface Chemistry between HCN and Cosmic Silicates by the Interplay of Infrared Spectroscopy and Quantum Chemical Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interaction between hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and silicate surfaces is crucial for elucidating the prebiotic processes occurring on interstellar grain cores, as well as in cometary and meteoritic matrices. In this study, we characterized the adsorption features of HCN on crystalline forsterite (Mg2SiO4) surfaces, one of the most abundant cosmic silicates, by combining experimental infrared spectra at low temperatures (100-150 K) with periodic DFT simulations. Results showed the coexistence of both molecular and dissociative HCN adsorption complexes as a function of the considered forsterite crystalline face. Molecular adsorptions dominate on the most stable surfaces, while dissociative adsorptions occur predominantly on surfaces of lower stability, catalyzed by the enhanced Lewis acid-base behavior of surface-exposed Mg2+-O2- ion pairs. On the whole set of adsorption cases, harmonic frequency calculations were carried out and compared with the experimental infrared bands. To disentangle each vibrational mode contributing to the experimental broad bands, we run a best non-linear fit between the predicted set of frequencies and the experimental bands. The outcome of this procedure allowed us to: i) deconvolute the experimental IR spectrum by assigning computed normal modes of vibrations to the main features of each band; ii) reveal which crystal faces are responsible of the largest contribution to the adsorbate vibrational bands, giving information about the morphology of the samples. The present straigthforward procedure is quite general and of broad interest in the fine characterization of the infrared spectra of adsorbates on complex inorganic material surfaces.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Magnetic States of Tb Adatom on Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure and magnetic interactions of a Tb adatom on graphene are investigated from first principles using combination of density functional theory and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry techniques including spin-orbit coupling. We determine that the six-fold symmetry hollow site is the preferred adsorption site and we investigate electronic spectrum for different adatom oxidation states including Tb$^{3+}$, Tb$^{2+}$, Tb$^{1+}$, and Tb$^{0}$. For all charge states, the Tb $4f^8$ configuration is retained with other adatom valence electrons being distributed over $5d_{xy}$, $5d_{x2+y2}$, and $6s/5d_0$ single-electron orbitals. We find strong intra-site adatom exchange coupling that ensures that the $5d6s$ spins are parallel to the $4f$ spin. For Tb$^{3+}$, the energy levels can be described by the $J=6$ multiplet split by the graphene crystal field. For other oxidation states, the interaction of $4f$ electrons with spin and orbital degrees of freedom of $6s5d$ electrons in the presence of spin-orbit coupling results in the low-energy spectrum composed closely lying effective multiplets that are split by the graphene crystal field. Stable magnetic moment is predicted for Tb$^{3+}$ and Tb$^{2+}$ adatoms due to uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and effective anisotropy barrier around 440 cm$^{-1}$ controlled by the temperature assisted quantum tunneling of magnetization through the third excited doublet. On the other hand, in-plane magnetic anisotropy is found for Tb$^{1+}$ and Tb$^{0}$ adatoms. Our results indicate that the occupation of the $6s5d$ orbitals can dramatically affect the magnetic anisotropy and magnetic moment stability of rare earth adatoms.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Device-Driven Screening of Sub-1-nm Thickness Oxide Semiconductors for Future CMOS Technology Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin oxide semiconductors with sub-1-nm thickness are promising building blocks for ultrascaled field-effect transistor (FET) applications due to their resilience against short-channel effects, high air stability, and potential for low-energy device operation. However, the n-type dominance of ultrathin oxide FET has hindered their integration into complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which requires both n-and p-type devices. Here we develop an ab initio device-driven computational screening workflow to identify sub-1-nm thickness oxide semiconductors for sub-5-nm FET applications. We demonstrate that ultrathin CaO2, CaO, and SrO are compatible with p-type device operations under both high-performance (HP) and low-power (LP) requirements specified by the International Technology Roadmap of Semiconductors (ITRS), thereby expanding the limited family of p-type oxide semiconductors. Notably, CaO and SrO emerge as the first-of-kind sub-1-nm thickness oxide semiconductors capable of simultaneously meeting the ITRS HP and LP criteria for both n-and p-type devices. CaO and SrO FETs outperform many existing low-dimensional semiconductors, exhibiting scalability below 5-nm gate length. Our findings offer a pioneering effort in the ab initio, device-driven screening of sub-1-nm thickness oxide semiconductors, significantly broadening the material candidate pool for future CMOS technology nodes.</description>

      <title>Structural and electronic transformations in TiO2 induced by electric current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-situ diffuse neutron scattering experiments revealed that when electric current is passed through single crystals of rutile TiO2 under conditions conducive to flash sintering, it induces the formation of parallel planes of oxygen vacancies. Specifically, a current perpendicular to the c-axis generates planes normal to the (132) reciprocal lattice vector, whereas currents aligned with the c-axis form planes normal to the (132) and to the (225) vector. The concentration of defects increases with incresing current. The structural modifications are linked to the appearance of signatures of interacting Ti3+ moments in magnetic susceptibility, signifying a structural collapse around the vacancy planes. Electrical conductivity measurements of the modified material reveal several electronic transitions between semiconducting states (via a metal-like intermediate state) with the smallest gap being 27 meV. Pristine TiO2 can be restored by heating followed by slow cooling in air. Our work suggests a novel paradigm for achieving switching of electrical conductivity related to the flash phenomenon</description>

      <title>Strong anharmonicity dictates ultralow thermal conductivities of type-I clathrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-I clathrate solids have attracted significant interest due to their ultralow thermal conductivities and subsequent promise for thermoelectric applications, yet the mechanisms underlying these properties are not well understood. Here, we extend the framework of vibrational dynamical mean-field theory (VDMFT) to calculate temperature-dependent thermal transport properties of $X_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$, where $X=$ Ba, Sr, using a many-body Green's function approach. We find that nonresonant scattering between cage acoustic modes and rattling modes leads to a reduction of acoustic phonon lifetimes and thus thermal conductivities. Moreover, we find that the moderate temperature dependence of conductivities above 300 K, which is consistent with experimental measurements, cannot be reproduced by standard perturbation theory calculations, which predict a $T^{-1}$ dependence. Therefore, we conclude that nonperturbative anharmonic effects, including four- and higher-phonon scattering processes, are responsible for the ultralow thermal conductivities of type-I clathrates.</description>

      <title>Strong Electron-Phonon Coupling and Lattice Dynamics in One-Dimensional [(CH3)2NH2]PbI3 Hybrid Perovskite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid halide perovskites (HHPs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties that combine the advantages of low cost-effective fabrication methods of organic-inorganic materials. Notably, low-dimensional hybrid halide perovskites including two-dimensional (2D) layers and one-dimensional (1D) chains, are recognized for their superior stability and moisture resistance, making them highly appealing for practical applications. Particularly, DMAPbI3 has attracted attention due to other interesting behaviors and properties, such as thermally induced order-disorder processes, dielectric transition, and cooperative electric ordering of DMA dipole moments. In this paper, we investigated the interplay between low-temperature SPT undergone by the low-dimensional (1D) hybrid halide perovskite-like material DMAPbI3 and its optoelectronic properties. Our approach combines synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, thermo-microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and photoluminescence (PL) techniques. Temperature-dependent Synchrotron powder diffraction and Raman Spectroscopy reveal that the modes associated with I-Pb-I and DMA+ ion play a crucial role in the order-disorder SPT in DMAPbI3. The reversible SPT modifies its optoelectronic properties, notably affecting its thermochromic behavior and PL emission. The origin of the PL phenomenon is associated to self-trapped excitons (STEs), which are allowed due to a strong electron-phonon coupling quantified by the Huang-Rhys factor (S = 97+-1). Notably, we identify the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode at 84 cm-1 which plays a significant role in electron-phonon interaction. Our results show these STEs not only intensify the PL spectra at lower temperatures but also induce a shift in the color emission, transforming it from a light orange-red to an intense bright strong red.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered cobaltate CaCoO$_2$ exhibits a unique herringbone-like structure. Serving as a potential prototype for a new class of complex lattice patterns, we study the properties of CaCoO$_2$ using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). Our results reveal a significant inter-plane hybridization between the Ca $4s-$ and Co $3d-$orbitals, leading to an inversion of the textbook orbital occupation of a square planar geometry. Further, our RIXS data reveal a strong low energy mode, with anomalous intensity modulations as a function of momentum transfer close to a quasi-static response suggestive of electronic and/or orbital ordering. These findings indicate that the newly discovered herringbone structure exhibited in CaCoO$_2$ may serve as a promising laboratory for the design of materials having strong electronic, orbital and lattice correlations.</description>

Abstract: Energy band theory is a foundational framework in condensed matter physics. In this work, we employ a deep learning method, BNAS, to find a direct correlation between electronic band structure and superconducting transition temperature. Our findings suggest that electronic band structures can act as primary indicators of superconductivity. To avoid overfitting, we utilize a relatively simple deep learning neural network model, which, despite its simplicity, demonstrates predictive capabilities for superconducting properties. By leveraging the attention mechanism within deep learning, we are able to identify specific regions of the electronic band structure most correlated with superconductivity. This novel approach provides new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity from an alternative perspective. Moreover, we predict several potential superconductors that may serve as candidates for future experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Modelling of nucleate pool boiling on coated substrates using machine learning and empirical approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface modification results in substantial improvement in pool boiling heat transfer. Thin film-coated and porous-coated substrates, through different materials and techniques, significantly boost heat transfer through increased nucleation due to the presence of micro-cavities on the surface. The existing models and empirical correlations for boiling on these coated surfaces are constrained by specific operating conditions and parameter ranges and are hence limited by their prediction accuracy. This study focuses on developing an accurate and reliable Machine Learning (ML) model by effectively capturing the actual relationship between the influencing variables. Various ML algorithms have been evaluated on the thin film-coated and porous-coated datasets amassed from different studies. The CatBoost model demonstrated the best prediction accuracy after cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. For the optimized CatBoost model, SHAP analysis has been carried out to identify the prominent influencing parameters and interpret the impact of parameter variation on the target variable. This model interpretation clearly justifies the decisions behind the model predictions, making it a robust model for the prediction of nucleate boiling Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) on coated surfaces. Finally, the existing empirical correlations have been assessed, and new correlations have been proposed to predict the HTC on these surfaces with the inclusion of influential parameters identified through SHAP interpretation.

      <title>Unconventional two-dimensional quantum oscillations in three-dimensional thick SrRuO$_3$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SrRuO$_3$ is a prototypical transition metal oxide which hosts rich physical properties including itinerant ferromagnetism, high conductivity, and intrinsic Hall effect originating in the Weyl points. Recently, high-quality SrRuO$_3$ films with residual resistivity ratios of more than 50 have been reported to exhibit quantum oscillations at low temperatures in spite of its strong electron correlation. While the origin of the oscillations has been discussed in relation to Weyl orbits based on the Weyl semimetal band structure, so far experimentally reported results are neither consistent with each other nor with theoretically expected behavior, leaving the origin of the oscillations in SrRuO$_3$ films still elusive. In this report, we have carefully evaluated the quantum oscillations observed in three-dimensional thick SrRuO$_3$ films with a high residual resistivity ratio of RRR = 82. We reveal the coexistence of two oscillation components both derived from two-dimensional electronic states and with slightly different masses, suggesting the involvement of the surface Fermi arc states formed between different Weyl point pairs.</description>

      <title>Wavevector-resolved polarization entanglement from radiative cascades</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of entangled photons from radiative cascades has enabled milestone experiments in quantum information science with several applications in photonic quantum technologies. Significant efforts are being devoted to pushing the performances of near-deterministic entangled-photon sources based on single quantum emitters often embedded in photonic cavities, so to boost the flux of photon pairs. The general postulate is that the emitter generates photons in a nearly maximally entangled state of polarization, ready for application purposes. Here, we demonstrate that this assumption is unjustified. We show that in radiative cascades there exists an interplay between photon polarization and emission wavevector, strongly affecting quantum correlations when emitters are embedded in micro-cavities. We discuss how the polarization entanglement of photon pairs from a biexciton-exciton cascade in quantum dots strongly depends on their propagation wavevector, and it can even vanish for large emission angles. Our experimental results, backed by theoretical modelling, yield a brand-new understanding of cascaded emission for various quantum emitters. In addition, our model provides quantitative guidelines for designing optical microcavities that retain both a high degree of entanglement and collection efficiency, moving the community one step further towards an ideal source of entangled photons for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of the third-order anomalous Hall effect: from clean to disorder regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third-order anomalous Hall effect (TOAHE) driven by Berry connection polarizability in Dirac materials offers a promising avenue for exploring quantum geometric phenomena. We investigate the role of impurity scattering on TOAHE using the semiclassical Boltzmann framework, via a comparison of the intrinsic contributions (stemming from the Berry connection polarizability effect) with the extrinsic contributions caused by the disorder. To validate our theoretical findings, we employ a generalized two-dimensional low-energy Dirac model to analytically assess the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the TOAHE. Our analysis reveals distinct disorder-mediated effects, including skew scattering and side jump contributions. We also elucidate their intriguing dependencies on Fermi surface anisotropy and discuss opportunities for experimental exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase diagram and sound velocities of the Fe-Si binary alloy, crucial for understanding the Earth's core, are determined at inner core boundary pressure with \textit{ab-initio} accuracy through deep-learning-aided hybrid Monte Carlo simulations. A complex phase diagram emerges close to the melting temperature, where a re-entrance of the body-centered cubic (bcc) phase is observed. The bcc structure is stabilized by a pronounced short-range ordering of the Si atoms. The miscibility gap between the short-range ordered bcc structure and the long-range ordered cubic B2 structure shrinks with increasing temperature and the transition becomes continuous above 6000 K. We find that a bcc Fe-Si solid solution reproduces crucial geophysical data such as the low shear sound velocity and the seismic anisotropy of the inner core much better than other structures.</description>

      <title>AI-accelerated discovery of high critical temperature superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing this AI search engine, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ and B$_5$CN$_2$ whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>Gate-defined flat-band charge carrier confinement in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) near the magic angle is an interesting platform to study correlated electronic phases. These phases are gate-tunable and are closely related to the presence of flat electronic bands, isolated by single-particle band gaps. This allows electrostatically controlled confinement of charge carriers in the flat bands to explore the interplay between confinement, band renormalisation, electron-electron interactions and the moir\'e superlattice, potentially revealing key mechanisms underlying these electronic phases. Here, we show gate-controlled flat-band charge carrier confinement in near-magic-angle tBLG, resulting in well-tunable Coulomb blockade resonances arising from the charging of electrostatically defined islands in tBLG. Coulomb resonance measurements allow to study magnetic field-induced quantum oscillations in the density of states of the source-drain reservoirs, providing insight into the gate-tunable Fermi surfaces of tBLG. Comparison with tight-binding calculations emphasises the importance of displacement-field-induced band renormalisation, which is crucial for future advanced gate-tunable quantum devices and circuits in tBLG.</description>

      <title>Unifying the description of hydrocarbons and hydrogenated carbon materials with a chemically reactive machine learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general-purpose machine learning (ML) interatomic potential for carbon and hydrogen which is capable of simulating various materials and molecules composed of these elements. This ML interatomic potential is trained using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework and an extensive dataset of C-H configurations obtained from density functional theory. The dataset is constructed through iterative training and structure-search techniques that generate a broad range of configurations to comprehensively sample the potential energy surface. Furthermore, the dataset is supplemented with relevant bulk, molecular, and high-pressure structures. Finally, long-range van der Waals interactions are added as a locally parametrized model. The accuracy and generality of the potential are validated through the analysis of different simulations under a wide range of conditions, including weak interactions, high temperature, and high pressure. We show that our CH GAP model describes different problems such as the formation of simple and complex alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H), and CH systems at extreme conditions, while retaining good accuracy for pure carbon materials. We use this model to generate hydrocarbons of different sizes and complexity without prior knowledge of organic chemistry rules, and to highlight intrinsic limitations to the simultaneous description on intra and intermolecular interactions within a single computational framework. Our general-purpose ML interatomic potential has the capability to significantly advance research in the field of H-containing carbon materials and compounds, particularly in the areas where longer dynamics, reactivity and large-scale effects may be important.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries, stemming from the projective algebra of synthetic gauge fields, can modify the manifold of the Brillouin zone and lead to a variety of topological phenomena. We present an acoustic realization of higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) protected by a pair of anticommutative momentum-space glide reflections. We confirm the presence of momentum-space glide reflection from the measured momentum half translation of edge bands and their momentum-resolved probability distribution using a cylinder geometry made of acoustic resonator arrays. In particular, we observe both intrinsic and extrinsic HOTI features in such a cylinder: hopping strength variation along the open boundary leads to a bulk gap closure, while that along the closed boundary results in an edge gap closure. In addition, we confirm the presence of quadrupole corner modes with transmission and field distribution measurements. Our observation enriches the study of topological physics of momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries.</description>

      <title>Porous CrO$_2$: a ferromagnetic half-metallic member in sparse hollandite oxide family</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stable polymorph of CrO$_2$ is predicted using PBE+U method. The porous material is isostructural with $\alpha-$MnO$_2$ making it the second transition metal oxide in sparse hollandite group of materials. However, unlike the anti-ferromagnetic semiconducting character of the $\alpha-$MnO$_2$, it is found to be a ferromagnetic half-metal. At Fermi level, the hole pocket has ample contribution from O$-2p$ orbital, though, the electron pocket is mostly contributed by Cr$-3d_{xy}$ and Cr$-3d_{x^2-y^2}$. A combination of negative charge transfer through orbital mixing and extended anti-bonding state near Fermi level is responsible for the half-metallic ferromagnetic character of the structure. A comparative study of rutile and hollandite CrO$_2$ and hollandite MnO$_2$ structures delineate the interplay between structural, electronic and magnetic properties. The material shows a robust magnetic character under hydrothermal pressure, as well as, the band topology is conserved under uniaxial strain. Moderate magneto-crystalline anisotropy is observed and it shows a correspondence with the anisotropy of elastic constants. Occurrence of type$-$II Weyl nodes and their evolution under pressure is explored.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of antiferromagnetic coupling at YIG/permalloy interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14553v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic origin of antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling in the Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and permalloy (Py) bilayer system at the atomic level. Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) reveal unique hybrid modes in samples prepared with surface ion milling, indicative of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling at the YIG/Py interface. Using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we found that AFM coupling appears at the YIG/Py interface of the tetrahedral YIG surface formed with ion milling. The STEM measurements suggest that the interfacial AFM coupling is predominantly driven by an oxygen-mediated super-exchange coupling mechanism, which is confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to be energetically favorable. Thus, the combined experimental and theoretical results reveal the critical role of interfacial atomic structure in determining the type magnetic coupling in a YIG/ferromagnet heterostructure, and prove that the interfacial structure can be experimentally tuned by surface ion-milling.</description>

      <title>Assessing carrier mobility, dopability, and defect tolerance in the chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS$_3$ has attracted much attention as a promising solar absorber for thin-film photovoltaics. Here, we use first-principles calculations to evaluate its carrier transport and defect properties. We find that BaZrS$_3$ has a phonon-limited electron mobility of 37 cm$^2$/Vs comparable to that in halide perovskites but lower hole mobility of 11 cm$^2$/Vs. The defect computations indicate that BaZrS$_3$ is intrinsically n-type due to shallow sulfur vacancies, but that strong compensation by sulfur vacancies will prevent attempts to make it p-type. We also establish that BaZrS$_3$ shows some degree of defect tolerance, presenting only few low formation energy, deep intrinsic defects. Among the deep defects, sulfur interstitials are the dominant nonradiative recombination centers but exhibit a moderate capture coefficient. Our work highlights the material's intrinsic limitations in carrier mobility and p-type doping and suggests focusing on suppressing the formation of sulfur interstitials to reach longer carrier lifetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimized effective potential (OEP) approach has so far mainly been used in benchmark studies and for the evaluation of band gaps. In this work, we extend the application of the OEP by determining the analytical ionic forces within the plane-wave and pseudopotential framework. It is first shown that, due to the constrained optimization inherent to the OEP approach, an extra term needs to be added to the standard Hellmann-Feynman expression for the forces, whenever nonlocal pseudopotentials are employed. Computing this term for functionals based on Hartree-Fock and the hybrid PBE0 functional yields forces with excellent numerical accuracy. Furthermore, results for equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies on a set of molecules and solids confirm that the local exchange OEP is able to reproduce results obtained with the nonlocal exchange potential. Our work opens up the possibility to study lattice dynamics using advanced orbital functionals for describing exchange and correlation effects.</description>

Abstract: Controlled synthesis of metastable materials away from equilibrium is of interest in materials chemistry. Thin film deposition methods with rapid condensation of vapor precursors can readily synthesize metastable phases, but often struggle to yield the thermodynamic ground state. Growing thermodynamically-stable structures using kinetically-limited synthesis methods in important for practical applications in electronics and energy conversion. Here, we reveal a synthesis pathway to thermodynamically-stable ordered layered ternary nitride materials, and discuss why disordered metastable intermediate phases tend to form. We show that starting from elemental vapor precursors leads to a 3D long-range disordered MgMoN2 thin film metastable intermediate structure, with a layered short-range order that has a low-energy transformation barrier to the layered 2D-like stable structure. This synthesis approach is extended to ScTaN2, MgWN2 and MgTa2N3, and may lead to the synthesis of other layered nitride thin films with unique semiconducting and quantum properties.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00755v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning have led to the development of foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across diverse compounds at reduced computational cost. Hitherto, these models have been benchmarked relying on descriptors based on atoms' interaction energies or harmonic vibrations; their accuracy and efficiency in predicting observable and technologically relevant heat-conduction properties remains unknown. Here, we introduce a framework that leverages foundation models and the Wigner formulation of heat transport to overcome the major bottlenecks of current methods for designing heat-management materials: high cost, limited transferability, or lack of physics awareness. We present the standards needed to achieve first-principles accuracy in conductivity predictions through model's fine-tuning, discussing benchmark metrics and precision/cost trade-offs. We apply our framework to a database of solids with diverse compositions and structures, demonstrating its potential to discover materials for next-gen technologies ranging from thermal insulation to neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Type-I and Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric (TE) properties of nodal line semimetals (NLSs) using a combination of semi-analytical calculations within Boltzmann's linear transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, along with first-principles calculations for the so-called type-I and type-II NLSs. We consider the conduction and valence bands that cross near the Fermi level of these materials through first-principles calculations of typical type-I (TiS) and type-II (Mg$_3$Bi$_2$) NLSs and use the two-band model fit to find the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ and effective mass $m$ that will be employed as the initial energy dispersion parameters. The optimum curvature value for each energy band is searched by tuning the energy dispersion parameters to improve the TE properties of the NLss. We can obtain the best $\sim$$3.5\%$ increase in the Seebeck coefficient peak value compared to those using the initial parameter value in the type-I NLS, with the Seebeck coefficient ranging from $0.509S_{0}$ to $0.527S_{0}$ where $S_0 \approx 86.17~\mu$V/K. Meanwhile, the best increase in power factor, as large as $\sim$$83\%$ the initial value, can be obtained in the type-II NLS when $v_{F}$ is lowered. By systematically comparing all of our calculation results, we observed that tuning $v_{F}$ significantly improves TE properties in both types of NLS compared to tuning $m$. Our work is expected to trigger further calculations to scan other potential TE materials, particularly in the class of semimetals, by manipulating their band structure through the variation of the curvatures of their energy bands.</description>

      <title>Tuning collective actuation of active solids by optimizing activity localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active solids, more specifically elastic lattices embedded with polar active units, exhibit collective actuation when the elasto-active feedback, generically present in such systems, exceeds some critical value. The dynamics then condensates on a small fraction of the vibrational modes, the selection of which obeys non trivial rules rooted in the nonlinear part of the dynamics. So far the complexity of the selection mechanism has limited the design of specific actuation. Here we investigate numerically how, localizing the activity on a fraction of modes, one can select non-trivial collective actuation. We perform numerical simulations of an agent based model on triangular and disordered lattices and vary the concentration and the localization of the active agents on the lattices nodes. Both contribute to the distribution of the elastic energy across the modes. We then introduce an algorithm, which, for a given fraction of active nodes, evolves the localization of the activity in such a way that the energy distribution on a few targeted modes is maximized -- or minimized. We illustrate on a specific targeted actuation, how the algorithm performs as compared to manually chosen localization of the activity. While, in the case of the ordered lattice, a well educated guess performs better than the algorithm, the latter outperform the manual trials in the case of the disordered lattice. Finally, the analysis of the results in the case of the ordered lattice leads us to introduce a design principle based on a measure of the susceptibility of the modes to be activated along certain activation paths.</description>

      <title>Classifying topological floppy modes in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In floppy mechanical lattices, robust edge states and bulk Weyl modes are manifestations of underlying topological invariants. To explore the universality of these phenomena independent of microscopic detail, we formulate topological mechanics in the continuum. By augmenting standard linear elasticity with additional fields of soft modes, we define a continuum version of Maxwell counting, which balances degrees of freedom and mechanical constraints. With one additional field, these augmented elasticity theories can break spatial inversion symmetry and harbor topological edge states. We also show that two additional fields are necessary to harbor Weyl points in two dimensions, and define continuum invariants to classify these states. In addition to constructing the general form of topological elasticity based on symmetries, we derive the coefficients based on the systematic homogenization of microscopic lattices. By solving the resulting partial differential equations, we efficiently predict coarse-grained deformations due to topological floppy modes without the need for a detailed lattice-based simulation. Our discovery formulates novel design principles and efficient computational tools for topological states of matter, and points to their experimental implementation in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Group-IV Pentaoctite: A New 2D Material Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of novel two-dimensional (2D) pentaoctite (PO) monolayers composed of group-IV elements (PO-C, PO-Si, PO-Ge, and PO-Sn) using first-principles calculations. Stability is explored through phonon spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, confirming that all proposed structures are dynamically and thermally stable. Mechanical analysis shows that PO-C monolayers exhibit exceptional rigidity, while the others demonstrate greater flexibility, making them suitable for applications in foldable materials. The electronic properties show semimetallic behavior for PO-C and metallic behavior for PO-Si, while PO-Ge and PO-Sn possess narrow band gaps, positioning them as promising candidates for semiconductor applications. Additionally, PO-C exhibits potential as an efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with strain engineering further enhancing its catalytic performance. These findings suggest a wide range of technological applications, from nanoelectronics and nanomechanics to metal-free catalysis in sustainable energy production.</description>

      <title>Nernst Plateau in the Quantum Limit of Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nernst effect, a transverse electric current induced by a temperature gradient, is a promising tool for revealing emergent phases of condensed matter. We find a Nernst coefficient plateau in low carrier density topological insulators, as a signature of 1D Weyl points in the quantum limit of the weak topological insulator. The plateau height is inversely proportional to the impurity density, suggesting a way to engineer infinitely large Nernst effects. The Nernst plateau also exists in strong topological insulators, at the bottom of the lowest Landau band. We show that these plateaus have been overlooked in the previous experiments and we highlight the experimental conditions to observe them. Our results may inspire more investigations of employing anomalous Nernst effect to identify emergent phases of condensed matter.</description>
