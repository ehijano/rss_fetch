      <title>Maximal eventually different families for uniformly weak Ramsey ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\mathcal I$-maximal eventually different families of functions from the set of natural numbers into itself where $\mathcal I$ is an arbitrary ideal on the set of natural numbers that includes the ideal of all finite sets $\mathrm{fin}$. We introduce the class of uniformly weak Ramsey ideals and prove that there exists a closed $\mathcal I$-maximal eventually different family if $\mathcal I$ belongs to this class; this is the case for arbitrary $F_\sigma$ ideals and Fubini products $\mathrm{fin}^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$.</description>

      <title>The singleton degrees of the $\Sigma^0_2$ sets are not dense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering an open question raised by Cooper, we show that there exist $\Delta^0_2$ sets $D$ and $E$ such that the singleton degree of $E$ is a minimal cover of the singleton degree of $D$. This shows that the $\Sigma^{0}_{2}$ singleton degrees, and the $\Delta^{0}_{2}$ singleton degrees, are not dense (and consequently the $\Pi^0_2$ $Q$-degrees, and the $\Delta^{0}_{2}$ $Q$-degrees, are not dense). Moreover $D$ and $E$ can be built to lie in the same enumeration degree.</description>

      <title>Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, Maximum Deconstructibility, and set-generation of torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconstructibility is an often-used sufficient condition on a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules that allows one to carry out homological algebra \emph{relative to $\mathcal{C}$}. The principle \textbf{Maximum Deconstructibility (MD)} asserts that a certain necessary condition for a class to be deconstructible, is also sufficient. MD implies, for example, that the classes of Gorenstein Projective modules, Ding Projective modules, their relativized variants, and all torsion classes are deconstructible over any ring. MD was known to follow from Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and imply the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. We prove that MD is equivalent to Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, and to the assertion that all torsion classes of abelian groups are generated by a set (yielding the converse of a theorem of G\"obel and Shelah).</description>

      <title>Game-theoretic variants of splitting number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider combining the definition of a cardinal invariant and the notion of an infinite game. We focus on the splitting number $\mathfrak{s}$ since the corresponding cardinal invariants behave in an interesting way. We introduce three kinds of games as reasonable realizations of the combination of the notions of splitting and infinite games. Then, we consider two cardinal invariants for each game, so we define six numbers. We prove that three of them are equal to the size of the continuum $\mathfrak{c}$ and one of them is equal to the $\sigma$-splitting number $\mathfrak{s}_\sigma$, which is defined as the minimum size of a $\sigma$-splitting family. On the other hand, we show that the remaining two numbers are consistently different from $\mathfrak{c}$, $\mathfrak{s}$ and $\mathfrak{s}_\sigma$. Moreover, though the two numbers share almost the same rule of the game, we prove that they can take distinct values from each other, and hence the slight difference of the rule is actually crucial in this sense.</description>

      <title>Pretabular Tense Logics over S4t</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A logic $L$ is called tabular if it is the logic of some finite frame and $L$ is pretabular if it is not tabular while all of its proper consistent extensions are tabular. Pretabular modal logics are by now well investigated. In this work, we study pretabular tense logics in the lattice $\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{S4}_t)$ of all extensions of $\mathsf{S4}_t$, tense $\mathsf{S4}$. For all $n,m,k,l\in\mathbb{Z}^+\cup\{\omega\}$, we define the tense logic $\mathsf{S4BP}_{n,m}^{k,l}$ with respectively bounded width, depth and z-degree. We give characterizations of pretabular logics in some lattices of the form $\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{S4BP}_{n,m}^{k,l})$. We show that the set $\mathsf{Pre}(\mathsf{S4.3}_t)$ of all pretabular logics extending $\mathsf{S4.3}_t$ contains exactly 5 logics. Moreover, we prove that $|\mathsf{Pre}(\mathsf{S4BP}^{2,\omega}_{2,2})|=\aleph_0$ and $|\mathsf{Pre}(\mathsf{S4BP}^{2,\omega}_{2,3})|=2^{\aleph_0}$. Finally, we show that for all cardinal $\kappa$ such that $\kappa\leq{\aleph_0}$ or $\kappa=2^{\aleph_0}$, $|\mathsf{Pre}(L)|=\kappa$ for some $L\in\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{S4}_t)$. It follows that $|\mathsf{Pre}(\mathsf{S4}_t)|=2^{\aleph_0}$, which answers the open problem about the cardinality of $\mathsf{Pre}(\mathsf{S4}_t)$ raised in \cite{Rautenberg1979}.</description>

      <title>Terms that define nuclei on residuated lattices: a case study of BL-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nucleus $\gamma$ on a (bounded commutative integral) residuated lattice $\mathbf{A}$ is a closure operator that satisfies the inequality $\gamma(a) \cdot \gamma(b) \leq \gamma(a \cdot b)$ for all $a,b \in A$. In this article, among several results, a description of an arbitrary nucleus on a residuated lattice is given. Special attention is given to terms that define a nucleus on every structure of a variety, as a means of generalizing the double negation operation. Some general results about these terms are presented, together with examples. The main result of this article consists of the description of all terms of this kind for every given subvariety of BL-algebras. We exhibit interesting nontrivial examples.</description>

      <title>Divisibility classes of ultrafilters and their patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A divisibility relation on ultrafilters is defined as follows: ${\cal F}\hspace{1mm}\widetilde{\mid}\hspace{1mm}{\cal G}$ if and only if every set in $\cal F$ upward closed for divisibility also belongs to $\cal G$. Previously we isolated basic classes: powers of prime ultrafilters, and described the pattern of an ultrafilter, measuring the quantity of each basic class in a given ultrafilter. In this paper we define a topology on the set of basic classes which will allow us to calculate the pattern of the limit of a $\widetilde{\mid}$-increasing chain of ultrafilters. Using this we characterize which patterns can actually appear as patterns of an ultrafilter. $\widetilde{\mid}$ is not antisymmetric; in the respective quotient order we identify singleton classes and consider their patterns.</description>

      <title>On Universally Free First-Order Extensions of Belnap-Dunn's Four-Valued Logic and Nelson's Paraconsistent Logic N4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce the logics FFDE and FN4, which are universally free versions of Belnap-Dunn's four-valued logic, also known as the logic of first-degree entailment (FDE), and Nelson's paraconsistent logic QN4 (N-). Both FDE and QN4 are suitable to be interpreted as information-based logics, that is, logics that are capable of representing the deductive behavior of possibly inconsistent and incomplete information in a database. Like QN4 and some non-free first-order extensions of FDE, FFDE and FN4 are endowed with Kripke-style variable domain semantics, which allows representing the dynamic aspect of information processing, that is, how a database receives new information over time, including information about new individuals. We argue, however, that FFDE and FN4 can better represent the development of inconsistent and incomplete information states (i.e., configurations of a database) over time than their non-free versions. First, because they allow for empty domains, which corresponds to the idea that a database may acknowledge no individual at all at an early stage of its development. Second, because they allow for empty names, which get interpreted as information about new individuals is inserted into the database. Also, both systems include an identity predicate that is interpreted along the same lines of the other logical operators, viz., in terms of independent positive and negative rules.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Entropy and Quantum Algorithmic Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A state $\rho=(\rho_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence such that $\rho_n$ is a density matrix on $n$ qubits. It formalizes the notion of an infinite sequence of qubits. The von Neumann entropy $H(d)$ of a density matrix $d$ is the Shannon entropy of its eigenvalue distribution. We show: (1) If $\rho$ is a computable quantum Schnorr random state then $\lim_n [H(\rho_n )/n] = 1$. (2) We define quantum s-tests for $s\in [0,1]$, show that $\liminf_n [H(\rho_n)/n]\geq \{ s: \rho$ is covered by a quantum s-test $\}$ for computable $\rho$ and construct states where this inequality is an equality. (3) If $\exists c \exists^\infty n H(\rho_n)&gt; n-c$ then $\rho$ is strong quantum random. Strong quantum randomness is a randomness notion which implies quantum Schnorr randomness relativized to any oracle. (4) A computable state $(\rho_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is quantum Schnorr random iff the family of distributions of the $\rho_n$'s is uniformly integrable. We show that the implications in (1) and (3) are strict.</description>

      <title>A Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} theory for partial orders of a fixed finite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each $n\geq 2$, we show that the class of all finite $n$-dimensional partial orders, when expanded with $n$ linear orders which realize the partial order, forms a Fra\"iss\'e class and identify its Fra\"iss\'e limit $(D_n,&lt;,&lt;_1,\ldots,&lt;_n)$. We give a finite axiomatization of this limit which specifies it uniquely up to isomorphism among countable structures. We then show that the aforementioned class of finite structures satisfies the Ramsey property and conclude, by the Kechris-Pestov-Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} correspondence, that the automorphism group of its Fra\"iss\'e limit is extremely amenable. Finally, we identify the universal minimal flow of the automorphism group of the reduct $(D_n,&lt;)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the proximal game and semi-proximality in $\Psi$-spaces of almost disjoint families over an infinite countable set and $\Psi$-spaces of ladder systems on $\omega_1$. We show that a semi-proximal almost disjoint families must be nowhere MAD, anti-Luzin and characterize semi-proximality for a class of ${\mathbb R}$-embeddable almost disjoint families. We show that a $\Psi$-spaces defined from a uniformizable ladder system is semi-proximal and a $\Psi$-space defined on a $\clubsuit^*$ sequence is not semi-proximal. Thus the existence of non-semi-proximal $\Psi$-space over a ladder system is independent of ZFC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in our understanding of higher derived limits carry multiple implications in the fields of condensed and pyknotic mathematics, as well as for the study of strong homology. These implications are thematically diverse, pertaining, for example, to the sheaf theory of extremally disconnected spaces, to Banach--Smith duality, to the productivity of compact projective condensed anima, and to the structure of the derived category of condensed abelian groups. Underlying each of these implications are the combinatorics of multidimensionally coherent families of functions of small infinite cardinal height, and it is for this reason that we convene accounts of them together herein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{MV} we defined and proved the consistency of the principle ${\rm GM}^+(\omega_3,\omega_1)$ which implies that many consequences of strong forcing axioms hold simultaneously at $\omega_2$ and $\omega_3$. In this paper we formulate a strengthening of ${\rm GM}^+(\omega_3,\omega_1)$ that we call ${\rm SGM}^+(\omega_3,\omega_1)$. We also prove, modulo the consistency of two supercompact cardinals, that ${\rm SGM}^+(\omega_3,\omega_1)$ is consistent with ZFC. In addition to all the consequences of ${\rm GM}^+(\omega_3,\omega_1)$, the principle ${\rm SGM}^+(\omega_3,\omega_1)$, together with some mild cardinal arithmetic assumptions that hold in our model, implies that any forcing that adds a new subset of $\omega_2$ either adds a real or collapses some cardinal. This gives a partial answer to a question of Abraham \cite{AvrahamPhD} and extends a previous result of Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} \cite{Todorcevic82} in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06522v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the externally definable Ramsey property, a weakening of the Ramsey property for ultrahomogeneous structures, where the only colourings considered are those that are externally definable: that is, definable with parameters in an elementary extension. We show a number of basic results analogous to the classical Ramsey theory, and show that, for an ultrahomogeneous structure M with countable age, the externally definable Ramsey property is equivalent to the dynamical statement that, for each natural number n, every subflow of the space of n-types with parameters in M has a fixed point. We discuss a range of examples, including results regarding the lexicographic product of structures.</description>

      <title>Hindman's finite sums theorem and its application to topologizations of algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.01947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of the paper is a brief overview of Hindman's finite sums theorem, its prehistory and a few of its further generalizations, and a modern technique used in proving these and similar results, which is based on idempotent ultrafilters in ultrafilter extensions of semigroups. The second, main part of the paper is devoted to the topologizability problem of a wide class of algebraic structures called polyrings; this class includes Abelian groups, rings, modules, algebras over a ring, differential rings, and others. We show that the Zariski topology of such an algebra is always non-discrete. Actually, a much stronger fact holds: if $K$ is an infinite polyring, $n$ a natural number, and a map $F$ of $K^n$ into $K$ is defined by a term in $n$ variables, then $F$ is a closed nowhere dense subset of the space $K^{n+1}$ with its Zariski topology. In particular, $K^n$ is a closed nowhere dense subset of $K^{n+1}$. The proof essentially uses a multidimensional version of Hindman's finite sums theorem. The third part of the paper lists several problems concerning topologization of various algebraic structures, their Zariski topologies, and related questions.</description>
