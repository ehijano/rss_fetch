      <title>The double minimum E(3)$^1\Sigma^{+}_{\mathrm{u}}$ state in Cs$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double minimum E$^1\Sigma^{+}_{\mathrm{u}}$ state in caesium dimer was investigated by analysing spectra of the E$^1\Sigma^{+}_{\mathrm{u}}$ $\leftarrow$ X$^1\Sigma^{+}_{\mathrm{g}}$ band system, simplified by polarisation labelling. A total of 6727 rotationally resolved transitions to levels situated in the inner well and above the internal barrier were identified and a potential energy curve allowing to reproduce their energies was constructed using the Fourier grid Hamiltonian and inverted perturbation approach methods. The unambiguousness of the potential curve in view of lack of data related to levels located in the outer well is discussed.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering hypervolume of two-component fermions in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the zero-energy collision of three fermions, two of which are in the spin-down ($\downarrow$) state and one of which is in the spin-up ($\uparrow$) state. Assuming that the two-body and the three-body interactions have a finite range, we find a parameter, $D$, called the three-body scattering hypervolume. We study the three-body wave function asymptotically when three fermions are far apart or one spin-$\uparrow$ (spin-$\downarrow$) fermion and one pair, formed by the other two fermions, are far apart, and derive three asymptotic expansions of the wave function. The three-body scattering hypervolume appears in the coefficients of such expansions at the order of $B^{-5}$, where $B$ is the hyperradius of the triangle formed by the three fermions. When the interactions are weak, we calculate $D$ approximately using the Born expansion. We also analyze the energy shift of three such fermions in a large periodic cube due to $D$ and generalize this result to the many-fermion system. $D$ also determines the three-body recombination rate in two-component Fermi gases, and we calculate the three-body recombination rate in terms of $D$ and the density and temperature of the gas.</description>

      <title>Quantum Twin Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-correlated interferometer is a newly emerging tool in quantum technology that offers classical-limit-breaking phase sensitivity. But to date, there exists a configurational bottleneck for its practicability due to the low phase-sensitive photon numbers limited by the current detection strategies. Here we establish an innovative development termed as ``quantum twin interferometer'' with dual pairs of entangled twin beams arranged in the parallel configuration, allowing fully exploits the quantum resource through the new configuration of entangled detection. We observe the distributed phase sensing with 3 dB quantum noise reduction in phase-sensing power at the level of milliwatts, which advances the record of signal-to-noise ratio so far achieved in photon-correlated interferometers by three orders of magnitude. The developed techniques in this work can be used to revolutionize a diversity of quantum devices requiring phase measurement.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach for Strong Field QED Tests with He-like Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detailed comparisons between theory and experiment for quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in He-like ions have been performed in the literature to search for hints of new physics. Different frequentist statistical analyses of the existing atomic transition energy data have shown contradictory conclusions as to the presence of possible deviations from the theory predictions. We present here an approach using Bayesian statistics which allows to assign quantitative probabilities to the different deviation models from theory for He-like ions for $Z = 5$ to 92. Potential deviations beyond the standard model or higher order QED effects are modeled with $f(Z) \propto Z^k$ functions. Considering the currently available data, no significant difference between theory and experiment is found, and we show that recent experiments have reduced the possible deviations previously observed in the literature. Using past measurements and a weighted average on the different deviation models, we indicate the accuracy required for future measurements to investigated possible divergences.</description>

      <title>Fast single atom imaging for optical lattice arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution fluorescence imaging of ultracold atoms and molecules is paramount to performing quantum simulation and computation in optical lattices and tweezers. Imaging durations in these experiments typically range from a millisecond to a second, significantly limiting the cycle time. In this work, we present fast, 2.4 microseconds single-atom imaging in lattices, with 99.4% fidelity - pushing the readout duration of neutral atom quantum platforms to be close to that of superconducting qubit platforms. Additionally, we thoroughly study the performance of accordion lattices. We also demonstrate number-resolved imaging without parity projection, which will facilitate experiments such as the exploration of high-filling phases in the extended Bose-Hubbard models, multi-band or SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum link models.</description>

      <title>Lyman-$\alpha$ feedback prevails at Cosmic Dawn: Implications for the first galaxies, stars, and star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation pressure from Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) scattering is a potentially dominant form of early stellar feedback, capable of injecting up to $\sim 100 \, \times$ more momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM) than UV continuum radiation pressure and stellar winds. Ly$\alpha$ feedback is particularly strong in dust-poor environments and is thus especially important during the formation of the first stars and galaxies. As upcoming galaxy formation simulations incorporate Ly$\alpha$ feedback, it is crucial to consider processes that can limit it to avoid placing $\Lambda$CDM in apparent tension with recent \textit{JWST} observations indicating efficient star formation at Cosmic Dawn. We study Ly$\alpha$ feedback using a novel analytical Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer solution that includes the effects of continuum absorption, gas velocity gradients, Ly$\alpha$ destruction (e.g. by $2p \rightarrow 2s$ transitions), ISM turbulence, and atomic recoil. We verify our solution for uniform clouds using extensive Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) tests, and resolve a previous discrepancy between analytical and MCRT predictions. We then study the sensitivity of Ly$\alpha$ feedback to the aforementioned effects. While these can dampen Ly$\alpha$ feedback by a factor $\lesssim \textrm{few} \times 10$, we find it remains $\gtrsim 5 - 100 \, \times$ stronger than direct radiation pressure and therefore cannot be neglected. We provide an accurate fit for the Ly$\alpha$ force multiplier $M_{\rm F}$, suitable for implementation in subgrid models for galaxy formation simulations. Our findings highlight the critical role of Ly$\alpha$ feedback in regulating star formation at Cosmic Dawn, and underscore the necessity of incorporating it into simulations to accurately model early galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Atom-by-Atom Assembly of Defect-Free Two-Dimensional Mixed-Species Atomic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defect-free single atom array in optical tweezers is a promising platform for scalable quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. Extending single-species array to mixed-species one promise to offer new possibilities. In our recent proof of principle realization of defect-free two-dimensional assembly of mixed-species $^{85}$Rb ($^{87}$Rb) atom arrays [C. Sheng et al.\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.083202}{{\color{blue} Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 083202(2022)}}], the filling fractions were limited by the imperfect transfer of atoms and the occurrence of logjams during the atom rearrangement. In order to scale up the size of defect-free mixed-species atom array, we scale up the tweezer array and improve the atom transfer, and upgrade the heuristic heteronuclear algorithm so as to facilitate multiple rearrangement cycles. Consequently, we successfully create defect-free atom arrays with 120 mixed-species single atoms. The corresponding filling fraction and defect-free probability are improved to be 98.6(1)\% and 14(2)\%, respectively. It is anticipated that the enhanced algorithm can be extended to other combinations of atomic species, and this mixed-species atom array is readily for studies of many-body physics, quantum error correction, and quantum metrology.</description>
