      <title>Optical Torque and Plane Waves: An Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light, composed of massless photons, in addition to energy, carries linear and angular momentum, enabling it to exert forces and torques on matter. Recent advances in light-matter interactions particularly on optical torques and angular momentum transport, indicate considerable current interest. In this paper we consider optical torques exerted by elliptically polarized plane waves and related spin angular momentum transport. Using a classical approach using only Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force, we derive expressions for radiation pressure and areal torque density on dielectric slabs and waveplates. Our results provide a clear identity linking incident, reflected, and transmitted light fields to spin angular momentum density and its conservation. Our results should help resolve ambiguities in the literature, affirming the presence of spin angular momentum in elliptically polarized plane waves and highlighting the utility of classical electromagnetic theory in exploring optomechanical phenomena.</description>

      <title>All-optical computing with beyond 100-GHz clock rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computer's clock rate ultimately determines the minimum time between sequential operations or instructions. Despite exponential advances in electronic computer performance owing to Moore's Law and increasingly parallel system architectures, computer clock rates have remained stagnant at $\sim5~\mathrm{GHz}$ for almost two decades. This poses an intractable problem for applications requiring real-time processing or control of ultrafast information systems. Here we break this barrier by proposing and experimentally demonstrating computing based on an end-to-end and all-optical recurrent neural network harnessing the ultrafast nature of linear and nonlinear optical operations while avoiding electronic operations. The all-optical computer realizes linear operations, nonlinear functions, and memory entirely in the optical domain with $&gt;100~\mathrm{GHz}$ clock rates. We experimentally demonstrate a prototypical task of noisy waveform classification as well as perform ultrafast in-situ analysis of the soliton states from integrated optical microresonators. We further illustrate the application of the architecture for generative artificial intelligence based on quantum fluctuations to generate images even in the absence of input optical signals. Our results highlight the potential of all-optical computing beyond what can be achieved with digital electronics by utilizing ultrafast linear, nonlinear, and memory functions and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Flexible Full-Stokes Polarization Engineering by Disorder-Scrambled Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract: The ability to arbitrarily and flexibly control the polarization of light, including both the state of polarization (SoP) and the degree of polarization (DoP), is highly important for quantum optics, polarization imaging, and coherent optical communications. Although metasurfaces have shown promise in polarization control, the few studies focusing on the DoP often lack flexibility in manipulation. Here, we propose a novel approach using a disordered metasurface to flexibly convert natural light into partially polarized light, enabling independent and flexible control over all Stokes parameters. The metasurface is composed of two types of meta-atoms, uniformly distributed with specific quantity ratios, decoupling the design parameters in the process of polarization control, and allowing a one-to-one correspondence between metasurface and polarization spaces. The azimuthal and elevation angles of the SoP on the Poincar\'e sphere are independently controlled by the meta-atom rotation and size, while the DoP is governed by the quantity ratio. A developed algorithm determines the disordered metasurface arrangement, with theoretical calculations showing an average error of less than 3{\deg} for both the azimuthal and elevation angles and a control accuracy of \pm 0.05 for the DoP.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Serpentine-like Organic Crystal Optical Waveguides for Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical components and circuits that deal with multiple signal generation and processing are quintessential for artificial neural networks. Herein, we present a proof-of-concept four-layered organic optical artificial neural network (ANN)-like architecture, constructed from flexible organic crystals of (E)-1-(((5-methylpyridin-2-yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene-2-ol (MPyIN), employing an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip-based mechanical micromanipulation technique. Initially, the strategic selection of four MPyIN crystal active waveguides of varying lengths, mechanically bending them into serpentine-like forms, followed by their hierarchical integration, creates neuron-like, four-layered interconnected optical waveguides with six optical synapses. The synapses in the ANN-like architecture enable parallel transmissions of passive optical signals via evanescent coupling across multiple paths through various layers of the serpentine-shaped optical waveguides. Notably, the feedforward mechanism allows the synapses to multiply and split the optical signal generated at any input into four diverging signals with varying magnitudes. Here, certain outputs deliver a mixed signal (passive and active) due to diverging and converging optical transmission paths. This hierarchical, ANN-like tiny architecture paves the way for the development of smart optical neural networks utilizing multiple emissive and phase-changing organic crystals.</description>

      <title>Metasurface Polarimeter for Structural Imaging and Tissue Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histopathology, the study and diagnosis of disease through analysis of tissue samples, is an indispensable part of modern medicine. However, the practice is time consuming and labor intensive, compelling efforts to improve the process and develop new approaches. One perspective technique involves mapping changes in the polarization state of light scattered by the tissue, but the conventional implementation requires bulky polarization optics and is slow. We report the design, fabrication and characterization of a compact metasurface polarimeter operating at 640 nm enabling simultaneous determination of Stokes parameters and degree of polarization with $\pm$2% accuracy. To validate its use for histopathology we map polarization state changes in a tissue phantom mimicking a biopsy with a cancerous inclusion, comparing it to a commercial polarimeter. The results indicate a great potential and suggest several improvements with which we believe metasurface polarimeter based devices will be ready for practical histopathology application in clinical environment.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of 3D Nanophotonic Devices with Structural Integrity Using Auxiliary Thermal Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of nanophotonic structures with subwavelength features that control light across macroscopic scales. Gradient-based optimization offers an efficient approach to design these complex and non-intuitive structures. However, expanding this methodology from 2D to 3D introduces complexities, such as the need for structural integrity and connectivity. This work introduces a multi-objective optimization method to address these challenges in 3D nanophotonic designs. Our method combines electromagnetic simulations with an auxiliary heat-diffusion solver to ensure continuous material and void connectivity. By modeling material regions as heat sources and boundaries as heat sinks, we optimize the structure to minimize the total temperature, thereby penalizing disconnected regions that cannot dissipate thermal loads. Alongside the optical response, this heat metric becomes part of our objective function. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm by designing two 3D nanophotonic devices. The first is a focusing element. The second is a waveguide junction, which connects two incoming waveguides for two different wavelengths into two outgoing waveguides, which are rotated by 90{\deg} to the incoming waveguides. Our approach offers a design pipeline that generates digital blueprints for fabricable nanophotonic materials, paving the way for practical 3D nanoprinting applications.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the surface paradox: Buried perovskite quantum dots in wide-bandgap perovskite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are an exciting platform for on-demand quantum, and classical optoelectronic and photonic devices. However, their potential success is limited by the extreme sensitivity and low stability arising from their weak intrinsic lattice bond energy and complex surface chemistry. Here we report a novel platform of buried perovskite quantum dots (b-PQDs) in a three-dimensional perovskite thin-film, fabricated using one-step, flash annealing, which overcomes surface related instabilities in colloidal perovskite dots. The b-PQDs demonstrate ultrabright and stable single-dot emission, with resolution-limited linewidths below 130 {\mu}eV, photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.1), no blinking, suppressed spectral diffusion, and high photon count rates of 10^4/s, consistent with unity quantum yield. The ultrasharp linewidth resolves exciton fine-structures (dark and triplet excitons) and their dynamics under a magnetic field. Additionally, b-PQDs can be electrically driven to emit single photons with 1 meV linewidth and photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.4). These results pave the way for on-chip, low-cost single-photon sources for next generation quantum optical communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature, continuous-wave Terahertz generation in free-space with an intersubband mid-infrared photomixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a Terahertz photomixer pumped by mid-infrared photons at 10$\mu$m wavelength. The device is based on a dual-antenna architecture, in which a two-dimensional array of mid-infrared patch-antenna resonators is connected to the electrodes of a log-spiral Terahertz antenna. By exploiting intersubband absorption inside an AlGaAs-GaAs multi-quantum-well heterostructure, a photocurrent is coherently generated at the difference frequency between two quantum cascade lasers. The photocurrent drives the antenna electrodes allowing tunable, continuous-wave generation in free-space up to 1 Terahertz at room temperature. By experimentally studying the photomixer frequency response and dark impedance, we demonstrate that the observed power roll-off at high-frequency is limited by the combined effect of the photoexcited carrier's intrinsic lifetime and of the device $RC$ time constant. In the spectral range investigated we obtain, in continuous-wave, mid-infrared $\rightarrow$ Terahertz conversion efficiencies exceeding by orders of magnitude those of unipolar devices exploiting $\chi^{(2)}$ processes.</description>

      <title>Gigahertz directional light modulation with electro-optic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces promise spatiotemporal control over optical wavefronts, but achieving high-speed modulation with pixel-level control has remained an unmet challenge. While local phase control can be achieved with nanoscale optical confinement, such as in plasmonic nanoparticles, the resulting electrode spacings lead to large capacitance, limiting speed. Here, we demonstrate the operation of a gigahertz-tunable metasurface for beam steering through local control of metasurface elements in a plasmonic-organic hybrid architecture. Our device comprises a corrugated metallic slot array engineered to support plasmonic quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). These plasmonic quasi-BICs provide ideal optical confinement and electrical characteristics for integrating organic electro-optic (OEO) materials like JRD1 and have not been previously utilized in optical metasurfaces. We obtain a quasi-static resonance tunability of 0.4 nm/V, which we leverage to steer light between three diffraction orders and achieve an electro-optic bandwidth of ~4 GHz, with the potential for further speed improvements through scaling rules. This work showcases on-chip spatiotemporal control of light at the sub-micrometer and gigahertz level, opening new possibilities for applications in 3D sensing and high-speed spatial light modulation.</description>

      <title>A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to engineer pairs of entangled photons is essential to quantum information science, and generating these states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nano- and micrometer-scale materials offers numerous advantages. To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing nano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical description remains a challenge. Here, we propose a simplified model to describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of photon pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate processes, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our simplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple example of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and find agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to generate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant structures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across the field of quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>Optical frequency comb integration in radio telescopes: advancing signal generation and phase calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) enables high-angular-resolution observations in astronomy and geodesy by synthesizing a virtual telescope with baselines spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres. Achieving high instrumental phase stability in VLBI relies on the generation of high-quality, atomic-referenced RF local oscillator (LO) and RF-comb signals for the effective downconversion of celestial RF signals and precise phase calibration, respectively. As observing frequencies move into higher ranges with wider bandwidth, conventional electronic methods face significant challenges in maintaining the quality of these signals. Here, we demonstrate that an optical frequency comb (OFC) can be used as a versatile tool to generate and distribute low-noise and atomic-referenced RF-comb and RF-LO signals in the VLBI telescope. Hydrogen maser-stabilized optical pulses are transmitted over a timing-stabilized fibre link from the observatory building to the VLBI receiver system at the telescope, where photodetection converts them into the required RF-comb and RF-LO signals. In VLBI test observation, we successfully detected VLBI fringes and extracted the RF-combs characteristics in a format suitable for VLBI instrumental phase calibration. These results highlight the high potential of OFC-based technology for enhancing next-generation broadband VLBI measurements, advancing astrophysical research and facilitating intercontinental clock comparison.</description>

      <title>Tailored Thin Films: Modulating Soft Photonics with Dynamically Tunable Large Area Microstructures via Controlled Thermal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-assembled nano and micro-structures, particularly those capable of responsive erasure and regeneration, have garnered significant interest for their applications in smart photonics and electronics. However, current techniques for modulating these architectures largely depend on network rearrangement, posing challenges for in situ regeneration. Furthermore, their common fabrication techniques are complex and uncontrolled with the structures formed not being amenable for large area applications, thus compromising their economic viability. Herein, we present a controlled thermal process strategy for fabricating large-area, dynamically tunable, 1D,2D and 3D micro and nanostructures on a wide range of compatible materials including metals, semiconductors and polymers. By tuning the temperature changes in the system, thermal expansion coefficients of thin films and substrates, surface energy, Youngs modulus and thickness of the thin films we achieve robust, uniform, periodic structures over extensive areas on soft and stretchable substrates. The process is further supported by a theoretical model that we developed and validated by experiments and simulations. To showcase the robustness of our approach, we present prototypes of dynamically tunable diffraction gratings, optical diffusers, large-area reflective displays, camouflage devices, out-coupling efficiency enhancers, wearable devices and mechanochromic sensors.</description>

      <title>Supercharging Single-Atom Traps by Collisional Blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of trapped single atoms are an excellent platform for the simulation of many-body physics and the realisation of high-fidelity quantum gates. The confinement of atoms is often achieved with focussed laser beams acting as optical dipole-force traps that allow for both static and dynamic positioning of atoms. In these traps, light-assisted collisions -- enhancing the two-atom loss rate -- ensure that single atom occupation of traps can be realised. However, the time-averaged probability of trapping a single atom is limited to $0.5$ when loading directly from a surrounding cloud of laser-cooled atoms, preventing deterministic filling of large arrays. In this work, we demonstrate that increasing the depth of a static, optical dipole trap enables the transition from fast loading on a timescale of $2.1\,$s to an extended trap lifetime of $7.9\,$s. This method demonstrates an achievable filling ratio of $(79\pm2)\,\%$ without the need of rearranging atoms to fill vacant traps.</description>

      <title>Giant and Flexible Toroidal Circular Dichroism from Planar Chiral Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chirality, a fundamental concept describing an object cannot superpose with its mirror image, is crucial in optics and photonics and leads to various exotic phenomena, such as circular dichroism, and optical activity. Recent findings reveal that, besides electric and magnetic dipoles, toroidal dipoles, an elusive part of dynamic multipoles, can also contribute significantly to chirality. However, as toroidal dipoles are typically represented by solenoidal currents circulating on a three-dimensional (3D) torus, toroidal circular dichroism is usually observed in 3D intricate microstructures. Facing corresponding challenges in fabrication, integration and application, it is generally difficult to employ toroidal circular dichroism in compact metasurfaces for flexible modulation of chiral interactions between electromagnetic waves and matter. To overcome these stringent challenges, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the giant toroidal circular dichroism in a bilayer metasurface that is comprised of only planar layers, effectively bypassing various restrictions imposed by 3D microstructures. With the introduction of a displacement, or bilayer offset, between the opposite layers, we experimentally achieve giant chiral responses with the intrinsic circular dichroism (CD) reaching 0.69 in measurements, and the CD can be quantitatively manipulated in a simple manner. The giant intrinsic chirality primarily originates from distinct excitations of in-plane toroidal dipole moments under circular polarized incidences, and the toroidal chiral response is quantitatively controlled by the bilayer offset. Therefore, our work provides a straightforward and versatile approach for development of giant and flexible intrinsic chirality through toroidal dipoles with inherently planar layers, important for applications in communications, sensing, and chiroptical devices.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned design principles for enhanced red emission from nitride quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant effort has been devoted toward mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as they are viewed as detrimental to light emission, albeit with limited success for red emission. Here, we show that such fields can unusually enhance the optical oscillator strength of red-emitting nitride quantum wells. This insight is enabled by machine-learned models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, allowing for a global exploration of the quantum-well design space at greatly reduced computational cost. Larger polarization fields correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission, a consequence of the quantum-confined Stark effect enabling thinner quantum wells. This finding has implications for designing efficient red nitride LEDs, which are crucial for miniaturizing polychromatic LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. More broadly, this work highlights the power of machine learning in accelerating the discovery of unconventional paradigms for semiconductor design.</description>

      <title>Wettability and Color Change of Copper by Controlling Area Fraction of Laser Ablated Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, wettability control by area fraction of laser ablated surface of copper is presented. The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface. The control of the wetting angle from almost 0 degrees to 132 degrees was achieved for both ps and ns pulses by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. Cassie, Cassie-Baxter, and Wenzel models were adopted to explain the experimental results. For the first time, the wettability and color of copper were controlled by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. It is expected that the current results make an impact on the heat exchanger technology of water heat sinks, cooling units, atmospheric water generators, and fog harvesting and impact numerous applications from power plants to solar thermal water systems devices where highly-hydrophilic to super hydrophobic copper can be applied.</description>

      <title>Deterministic printing and heterointegration of single colloidal quantum dot photon sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single nanoparticles are essential building blocks for next-generation quantum photonic technologies, however, scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies have remained largely out of reach. Here, we present a new electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model that exploits nanoscale dielectrophoretics to precisely print single colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with accuracies allowing for fully-additive nanoscale photonics integration. Using colossal-shelled QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this method overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic limitations, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and the first single-photon emission from printed QDs. This additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process offers a scalable, sustainable pathway for heterointegrating nanomaterials down to the single particle level.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian states in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landau states of electrons with orbital angular momentum in magnetic fields are important in the quantum theories of metals and of synchrotron radiation at storage rings, in relativistic astrophysics of neutron stars, and in many other areas. In realistic scenarios, electrons are often born inside the field or injected from a field-free region, requiring nonstationary quantum states to account for boundary or initial conditions. This study presents nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) states in a longitudinal magnetic field, characterizing vortex electrons after their transfer from vacuum to the field. Comparisons with Landau states and calculations of observables such as mean energy and r.m.s. radius show that the r.m.s. radius of the electron packet in the NSLG state oscillates in time around a significantly larger value than that of the Landau state. This quantum effect of oscillations is due to boundary conditions and can potentially be observed in various problems, particularly when using magnetic lenses of electron microscopes and linear accelerators. Analogies are drawn between a quantum wave packet and a classical beam of many particles in phase space, including the calculation of mean emittance of the NSLG state as a measure of their quantum nature.</description>

      <title>Sub-2 Kelvin characterization of nitrogen-vacancy centers in silicon carbide nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient quantum communication technologies depends on the innovation in multiple layers of its implementation, a challenge we address from the fundamental properties of the physical system at the nano-scale to the instrumentation level at the macro-scale. We select a promising near infrared quantum emitter, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in 4H-SiC, and integrate it, at an ensemble level, with nanopillar structures that enhance photon collection efficiency into an objective lens. Moreover, changes in collection efficiency in pillars compared to bulk can serve as indicators of color center orientation in the lattice. To characterize NV center properties at the unprecedented sub-2 Kelvin temperatures, we incorporate compatible superconducting nanowire single photon detectors inside the chamber of an optical cryostat and create the ICECAP, the Integrated Cryogenic system for Emission, Collection And Photon-detection. ICECAP measurements show no significant linewidth broadening of NV ensemble emission and up to 14-fold enhancement in collected emission. With additional filtering, we measure emitter lifetimes of NV centers in a basal ($hk$) and an axial ($kk$) orientation unveiling their cryogenic values of 2.2 ns and 2.8 ns.</description>

      <title>Oblique photons, plasmons, and current-plasmons in relativistic plasmas and their topological implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photons in vacuum are transverse in any inertial frame; longitudinal photons only exist virtually. By developing a manifestly covariant theory for electromagnetic excitations in relativistic plasmas and applying Wigner's little group method for elementary particle classifications, we show that photons in plasmas are neither transverse nor longitudinal; they are oblique. Plasmons are electromagnetic and oblique as well. The Lorentz invariant characteristics that distinguishes photons and plasmons is covariant compressibility. The manifestly covariant theory predicts the existence of the current-plasmon, a third oblique, electromagnetic eigenmode, and it also enables the study of photon topology in plasmas. Plasmas remove the photon's Dirac point in vacuum by giving it an effective mass, but create a tilted Dirac-Weyl point by reviving the virtual longitudinal photon. The manifest covariance of the theory demonstrates that relativistic transparency, despite being widely studied, does not exist in plasmas.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Wave Localisation in Systems of Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of metamaterials composed of high-contrast subwavelength resonators and show the existence of localised modes in such a setting. A crucial assumption in this paper is time-modulated material parameters. We prove a so-called capacitance matrix approximation of the wave equation in the form of an ordinary differential equation. These formulas set the ground for the derivation of a first-principles characterisation of localised modes in terms of the generalised capacitance matrix. Furthermore, we provide numerical results supporting our analytical results showing for the first time the phenomenon of space-time localised waves in a perturbed time-modulated metamaterial. Such spatio-temporal localisation is only possible in the presence of subwavelength resonances in the unperturbed structure. We introduce the time-dependent degree of localisation to quantitatively determine the localised modes and provide a variety of numerical experiments to illustrate our formulations and results.</description>
