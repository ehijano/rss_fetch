      <title>Constructive Proofs of the Erdos-Straus Conjecture for Prime Numbers with P congruent to 1 modulo 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Erdos-Straus conjecture (ESC) concerns the representation of the fraction 4/P, where P is a prime number, as a sum of three positive unit fractions. The focus here is on the case when P is congruent to 1 modulo 4. Two constructive approaches are proposed. Method ED1 is based on a factorization identity and leads to a nonlinear parameterization in P, which requires divisor enumeration and local filtering. Method ED2 yields a linear system in P for the parameters (delta, b, c), describing the solution set as an affine lattice of finite index in Z^3. The central result states that for every prime P congruent to 1 modulo 4 there exists a representation: 4/P = 1/A + 1/(bP) + 1/(cP), where the triple (delta, b, c) in N^3 is constructed explicitly by method ED2. In addition, algorithms for transforming solutions (convolution and anti-convolution) are introduced, and large-scale computational verification confirms the correctness and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Bilinear forms with Kloosterman sums and moments of twisted L-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish power-saving estimates for general bilinear forms with Kloosterman sums modulo arbitrary q, including when both variables are shorter than the Polya-Vinogradov range. As an application, we obtain power-saving asymptotics for the second moment of (holomorphic or Maass) modular L-functions twisted with Dirichlet characters to an arbitrary large admissible modulus q. The bounds obtained are independent of the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture and remove all factorability conditions on q in the work of Blomer, Fouvry, Kowalski, Michel, Milicevic, and Sawin.</description>

      <title>Rank of Jacobian Varieties of Curves $y^s=x(ax^r+b)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a number field. We investigate the Mordell-Weil ranks of Jacobian varieties $J_C$ associated with algebraic curves $C$ of genus $g \geq 1$ defined by affine equations of the form $y^s=x(ax^r+b)$, where $a, b \in k$ ($ab \neq 0$), and $r \geq 1, s \geq 2$ are fixed integers. Assuming the strong version of Lang's conjecture concerning rational points on varieties of general type, we establish that the ranks $r(J_C(k))$ are uniformly bounded as $C$ varies within this family.
  Our methodology builds upon the geometric approach employed by H. Yamagishi and subsequently adapted by the author for the family $y^s=ax^r+b$. We construct a parameter space $\mathcal{W}_n$ for curves possessing $n+1$ specified rational points and analyze its birational model $\mathcal{X}_n$, a complete intersection variety. The geometric properties of the fibers of $\Xc_n \to \text{Sym}^{n+1}(\mathbb{P}^1)$, specifically their genus and gonality, are studied. Combining these geometric insights with Faltings' theorem, uniformity conjectures stemming from Lang's work, and recent results connecting rank with the number of rational points, we deduce the main boundedness result. In the case of genus one curves $C$, it states that the rank of elliptic curves $y^2=x (x^2+B)$ is uniformly bounded subject to the strong version of Lang's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Superspecial primes for QM abelian surfaces over real number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baba and Granath generalize Elkies' theorem on infinitude of supersingular primes for elliptic curves to abelian surfaces with quaternionic multiplication of discriminant $6$, whose field of moduli is $\mathbb{Q}$ and which is a Jacobian in characteristic $2$ and $3$. We extend the field of moduli to any number field with a real embedding, and weaken the local conditions at $2$ and $3$. The proof relies on the intersection theory of Heegner divisors on Shimura curves.</description>

      <title>Hermite's approach to Abelian integrals revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a new linear independence criterion for the values of certain {\it Lauricella hypergeometric series} $F_D$ with rational parameters, in both the complex and $p$-adic settings, over an algebraic number field. This result generalizes a theorem of C.~Hermite \cite{Hermite} on the linear independence of certain Abelian integrals. Our proof relies on explicit Pad\'{e} type approximations to solutions of a reducible Jordan-Pochhammer differential equation, which extends the Pad\'{e} approximations for certain Abelian integrals in \cite{Hermite}. The main novelty of our approach lies in the proof of the non-vanishing of the determinants associated with these Pad\'{e} type approximants.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Septic Number Fields with Large P\'olya Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a new family of cyclic septic fields $\{K_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}$ arising from the Hashimoto--Hoshi construction and characterize their P\'olya property under the condition that the polynomial $E(t) = t^{6} + 2t^{5} + 11t^{4} + t^{3} + 16t^{2} + 4t + 8$ takes fifth-power free values. We show that this family contains infinitely many non-P\'olya fields for which the cardinality of the P\'olya group is unbounded. We also establish that, assuming Bunyakovsky's conjecture for $E(t)$, this family contains infinitely many P\'olya fields. We further show that, for any fixed positive integer $m$, there exist infinitely many blocks of $m$ consecutive fields in this family whose cardinality of the P\'olya groups can be made arbitrarily large. Finally, we demonstrate that infinitely many fields in this family are non-monogenic with field index one.</description>

Abstract: We study the extensibility of $D(4)$-pairs $\{a,b\}$, where $b = ka$ and $k \in \{7,8,10,11,12,13\}$. Firstly, we show that it can be extended to a $D(4)$-triple with an element c, which is a member of a family of positive integers depending on a. Then, we prove that such a triple has a unique extension to a $D(4)$-quadruple.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of polynomials that map a local field (i.e., the completion of a number field at a non-Archimedean place) into the subset of its $p$-th powers, where $p$ is the residue characteristic of the field in question. We present a characterization of such polynomials and show that this class is always much broader than the class of $p$-th powers of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian amplification and bilinear forms with Kloosterman sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to bound bilinear (Type II) sums of Kloosterman sums with composite moduli $c$, using Fourier analysis on $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/c\mathbb{Z})$ and an amplification argument with non-abelian characters. For sums of length $\sqrt{c}$, our method produces a non-trivial bound for all moduli except near-primes, saving $c^{-1/12}$ for products of two primes of the same size. Combining this with previous results for prime moduli, we achieve savings beyond the P\'olya-Vinogradov range for all moduli. We give applications to moments of twisted cuspidal $L$-functions, and to large sieve inequalities for exceptional cusp forms with composite levels.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic maps sharing preimages over finitely generated fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ R$ be a compact Riemann surface, and let $ P: R \to \mathbb P^1(\mathbb C) $ and $ Q: R \to \mathbb P^1(\mathbb C) $ be holomorphic maps. In this paper, we investigate the following problem: under what conditions do the preimages $ P^{-1}(K) $ and $ Q^{-1}(K) $ coincide for some infinite set $K$ contained in $\mathbb P^1(k)$, where $k$ is a finitely generated subfield of $\mathbb C$ (e.g., a number field)? Equivalently, we study holomorphic correspondences that admit an infinite completely invariant set contained in $\mathbb P^1(k)$. We show that if such a set exists, then there is a holomorphic Galois covering $\Theta: R_0 \to \mathbb P^1(\mathbb C)$, where $R_0$ has genus zero or one, such that $ P $ and $ Q $ are ``compositional left factors" of $ \Theta.$ We also consider a more general equation $ P^{-1}(K_1) = Q^{-1}(K_2),$ where $K_1$ and $K_2$ are infinite subsets of $\mathbb P^1(k)$.</description>

      <title>Integrable Contour Kernels in Discrete $\beta=1,4$ Ensembles, Universality and Kuznetsov Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain explicit double-contour representations for the correlation kernels of the discrete orthogonal ($\beta=1$) and symplectic ($\beta=4$) random matrix ensembles with Meixner, Charlier, and Krawtchouk weights. A single Cauchy--difference--quotient composition identity expresses all $\beta=1,4$ blocks in terms of the projection kernel and bounded rational multipliers. From these formulas we give short steepest-descent proofs of bulk and edge universality (sine/Airy/Bessel) with uniform error control, an explicit Meixner$\to$Laguerre hard-edge crossover, and a first $A^{-1}$ correction that follows directly from the integrable structure. Finally, we show that Archimedean Kuznetsov tests splice into the Pfaffian kernels by a bounded holomorphic symbol acting in the contour variable; the symbol enters only through the same Cauchy difference--quotient, so the leading sine/Airy/Bessel limits persist and the $A^{-1}$ term again comes from linearizing at the saddle(s).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematicians have long been fascinated by the resolution of algebraic and Diophantine equations in search of integer or rational solutions. This article presents a list of thirty-three open problems in number theory, posed in the 13th century by Ibn al-Khaww\=am al-Baghd\=ad\=i (Abdall\=ah ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Khaww\=am), extracted from his arithmetic treatise al-Faw\=aid al-Bah\=aiyya f\=i qaw\=aid al-his\=abiyya. We provide a historical and arithmetic analysis of these problems and their solutions, and, whenever possible, offer original solutions and bibliographic notes. This work situates these problems within the broader development of number theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a profinite group $G$ and a rigid analytic space $X$, we study when an $\mathcal O_X(X)$-linear representation $V$ of $G$ admits a lattice, i.e. an $\mathcal O_{\mathcal X(\mathcal X)}$-linear model for a suitable formal model $\mathcal X$ of $X$ in the sense of Berthelot. We give a positive answer, under mild assumptions, when $X$ is strictly quasi-Stein. As a consequence, we are able to describe explicit open rational subdomains of $X$ over which $V$ is constant after reduction modulo a power of $p$. We give applications in two different directions. First, we prove explicit results on the reduction modulo powers of $p$ of sheaves of crystalline and semistable representations of fixed weight. Second, we deduce a result on the pseudorepresentation carried by the Coleman--Mazur eigencurve, which can be made explicit whenever equations for a rational subdomain of the eigencurve are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04226v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any constant $C_0&gt;0$, we construct a set $A \subset {\mathbb N}$ such that one has $$ \sum_{n \in A: n \leq x} \frac{1}{n} = \exp\left(\left(\frac{C_0}{2}+o(1)\right) (\log\log x)^{1/2} \log\log\log x \right)$$ and $$ \sum_{n,m \in A: n, m \leq x} \frac{1}{\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)} \ll_{C_0} \left(\sum_{n \in A: n \leq x} \frac{1}{n}\right)^2$$ as $x \to \infty$, with the growth rate given here optimal up to the dependence on $C_0$. This answers in the negative a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, and also clarifies the nature of certain ``mostly coprime'' sets studied by Bergelson and Richter.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the work of Roquette and Zassenhaus on the invariant part of the class groups to the relative class groups. Thereby, we can show some statistical results as follows. For abelian extensions over a fixed number field K, we show infinite Cp-moments for the Sylow p-subgroup of the relative class group when p divides the degree of the extension. For sextic number fields with A4-closure, we can show infinite C2-moments for the Sylow 2-subgroup of the relative class group when the extensions run over a fixed Galois cubic field.</description>

      <title>On generalizing the Van der Waerden theorem to some symmetric functions</title>

Abstract: Let $n,m$ be positive integers and $c \in \mathbb{Z}_n$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the ring of integers modulo $n$. We almost complete providing the answer to the following problem, partially solved by N. Alon. Does any infinite sequence over $\mathbb{Z}_n$ contain $m$ same-length consecutive blocks $B_1, \ldots, B_m$ s.t. $\sum B_j + c \prod B_j = 0$ for every $j=1,\ldots,m$ (where $\sum B$ and $\prod B$ denote, respectively, the sum and the product of the elements in block $B$)? In the case of $c=0$, this problem is equivalent to the Van der Waerden theorem. After investigating $B \mapsto \sum B + c\prod B$, we provide other examples of generalizing the Van der Waerden theorem.</description>

      <title>Prime numbers and dynamics of the polynomial $x^2-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. By $P(n)$ we denote the set of all prime divisors of the integers in the sequence $n, n^2-1, (n^2-1)^2-1, \dots$. We ask whether the set $P(n)$ determines $n$ uniquely under the assumption that $n \neq m^2-1$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 2}$. This problem originates in the structure theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. We show that the sets $P(n)$ generate infinitely many equivalence classes of positive integers under the equivalence relation $n_1 \sim n_2 \iff P(n_1) = P(n_2)$. We also prove that the sets $P(n)$ separate all positive integers up to $2^{29}$, and we provide some heuristics on why the answer to our question should be positive.</description>

      <title>Zeta Regularized Trigonometric Products Over Zeros Of The Riemann Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a novel zeta regularized product formula concerning regularization of trigonometric products over non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Furthermore, we calculate the discrepancies of such regularized products. In special cases, our formula reduces to the Kimoto-Wakayama formula. A conjectural relationship between such products and a weak Riemann hypothesis is speculated.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bounds in a popular polynomial Szemer\'{e}di theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain polylogarithmic bounds in the polynomial Szemer\'{e}di theorem when the polynomials have distinct degrees and zero constant terms. Specifically, let $P_1, \dots, P_m \in \mathbb Z[y]$ be polynomials with distinct degrees, each having zero constant term. Then there exists a constant $c = c(P_1,\dots,P_m) &gt; 0$ such that any subset $A \subset \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ of density at least $(\log N)^{-c}$ contains a nontrivial polynomial progression of the form $x, x+P_1(y), \dots, x+P_m(y)$. In addition, we prove an effective ``popular'' version, showing that every dense subset $A$ has some non-zero $y$ such that the number of polynomial progressions in $A$ with this difference $y$ is asymptotically at least as large as in a random set of the same density as $A$.</description>

      <title>No Nowhere Constant Continuous Function Maps All Non-Normal Numbers to Normal Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the set of non-normal numbers $\mathcal{N}^c$ and ask if there is a non-empty open interval $I$ and a nowhere constant continuous function $\varphi : I \to \mathbb{R}$ which maps all non-normal numbers to normal numbers, i.e., $\varphi(I \cap \mathcal{N}^c) \subset \mathcal{N}.$ We answer this question negatively. We call a set with this property \textit{super-dense}. The super-density of $\mathcal{N}^c$ illustrates further its topological size or geometric richness. Surprisingly, the measure-theoretically ``larger" set of normal numbers $\mathcal{N}$ does not share this property and we give an explicit Cantor-type construction of a nowhere constant continuous function $\hat{C}$, which maps all normal numbers to non-normal numbers. Our final result discusses the relation between super-density and the Baire categories employing various set-theoretic strategies.</description>

Abstract: We consider the integral points on the quadratic twists $E_D : y^2 = x^3+D^2Ax+D^3B$ of the elliptic curve $E : y^2 = x^3+Ax+B$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. For sufficiently large values of $D$, we prove that the number of integral points on $E_D$ admits the upper bound $\ll 4^r$, where $r$ denotes the Mordell-Weil rank of $E_D$.</description>

Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve. We consider a finite sequence of rational points $\{P_1,\ldots,P_N\}$ whose $x$-coordinates form an arithmetic progression in $\mathbb{Q}$. Under the assumption of Lang's conjecture on lower bounds for canonical height functions, we prove that the length $N$ of such sequences satisfies the upper bound $\ll A^r$, where $A$ is an absolute constant and $r$ is the Mordell-Weil rank of $E/\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.08800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of [13]. We study the linear disjointness between higher-order oscillating sequences and nonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, we prove that any oscillating sequence of order $m=d+k-1$ and any simple polynomial skew product of degree $k$ on the $d$-Euclidean space are linearly disjoint. Additionally, we demonstrate that any oscillating sequence of order $d$ and any minimal mean attractable and minimal quasi-discrete spectrum dynamical system of order $d$ are linearly disjoint. Finally, we introduce multi-linearly disjoint sequences and construct examples of such sequences.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>

Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several important general structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds we have seen hints of concrete $\widetilde {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ representations underlying the different $\hat Z$-invariants of the given manifolds. At the same time, these invariants appear to only span a subspace of the representation, and the role of the latter remains mysterious. We elucidate the meaning of the modular group representation, realized as vector-valued quantum modular forms, by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form for $\widetilde {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants of a given three-manifold, when the newly defined defects $\hat Z$-invariants are included. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for three three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these mock invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on the postage stamp problem for large numbers of stamps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F_h(n)$ denote the minimum cardinality of an additive {\em $h$-fold basis} of $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$: a set $S$ such that any integer in $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ can be written as a sum of at most $h$ elements from $S$. While the trivial bounds $h!n \; \lesssim \; F_h(n)^h \; \lesssim \; h^h n$ are well-known, comparatively little has been established for $h&gt;2$. In this paper, we make significant improvements to both of the best-known bounds on $F_h(n)$ for sufficiently large $h$. For the lower bound, we use a probabilistic approach along with the Berry-Esseen Theorem to improve upon the best-known asymptotic result due to Yu. We also establish the first nontrivial asymptotic upper bound on $F_h(n)$ by leveraging a construction for additive bases of finite cyclic groups due to Jia and Shen. In particular, we show that given any $\epsilon&gt;0$, for sufficiently large $h$, we have \[ \left(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon\right)h!\sqrt{2\pi e} n\; \leq \; F_h(n)^h \; \leq \; \left(\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\epsilon\right)h\right)^h n. \]</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod n homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}$. As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod n homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected, area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated, and products of area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically area-minimizing. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>

      <title>On Modified Diagonal Cycles and the Beauville Decomposition of the Ceresa Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a curve of genus $g \geq 2$, and let $J$ be its Jacobian. The choice of a degree 1 divisor $e$ on $C$ gives an embedding of $C$ into $J$; we denote by $[C]_{}^{e}\in \mathrm{CH}\left( J;\mathbb{Q} \right) $ the class in the Chow group of $J$ defined by its image. It is known that the vanishing of the Ceresa cycle $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e):=[C]^{e} - [-1]_* [C]^e$ is equivalent to both the vanishing of the 1st Beauville component $[C]_{(1)}^e$ and the vanishing of the 3rd Gross--Kudla--Schoen modified diagonal cycle $\Gamma^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Q})$. We extend this result to show that the vanishing of the $s$-th Beauville component $[C]^e_{(s)}$ for $s \geq 1$ is equivalent to the vanishing of the $(s+2)$-nd modified diagonal cycle $\Gamma^{s + 2}(C, e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^{s+2};\mathbb{Q})$. Moreover, we establish "successive vanishing" results for these cycles. We apply our results to study the rational (non)-triviality of $[C]^{e}_{(s)}$ in the special case $s = 2$. Finally in the $s=1$ case, we show an integral refinement to the original statement, relating the order of torsion of $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(J;\mathbb{Z})$ to that of $\Gamma^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Z})$.</description>
