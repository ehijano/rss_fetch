      <title>Phonon-mediated spin-polarized superconductivity in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the possibility of phonon-mediated unconventional superconductivity in a recently discovered new class of antiferromagnets, dubbed altermagnets. Within a weak-coupling approach, and using a minimal Lieb lattice model for altermagnets, we find a dominant superconducting instability odd in momentum and even in spin with spin-polarized Cooper pairs. We discuss the origin of this unusual result in terms of the spin-structure of the altermagnetic Fermi surface, in combination with the momentum-space structure of the effective phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions on the Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Dual view of the Z$_2$-Gauged XY Model in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $Z_2$ gauged neutral XY model is of long-standing interest both in the context of nematic order, and the study of fractionalization and superconductivity. This paper presents heuristic arguments that no deconfinement of the XY field occurs in this model and presents results of a large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on a cubic lattice which are consistent with this conclusion. The correlation radius determining the confinement is found to be growing rapidly as a function of the parameters in the phase featuring the nematic order. Thus, mesoscopic properties of the system can mimic deconfinement with high accuracy in some part of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Metal-to-superconductor Transition Induced by Lithium Adsorption on Monolayer 1$T$-Nb$_2$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two-dimensional Nb$_2$C has garnered increasing attention due to its functional-group-dependent superconductivity, both experimentally and theoretically. In contrast to the halogen and chalcogen additives that have been the main focus of previous studies, we study the effect of lithium adsorption, which can also be incorporated during the synthesis of Nb$_2$C. Our computational analysis reveals a metal-to-superconductor transition in monolayer Nb$_2$C with a critical temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) of 22.1 K and a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution following the adsorption of lithium atoms. This emergent superconductivity is attributed to the increased electronic states at the Fermi energy, resulting from the contribution of Nb-$d$ orbitals and electron gas states induced by the low electronegativity of lithium. Furthermore, the application of tensile strain raises the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ to 24 K, which is higher than that of most functional-group-modified Nb$_2$C systems. Our work deepens the understanding of electron-phonon coupling in layered Nb$_2$C, and provides new insights into achieving high critical temperature superconductivity with a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution in this system.</description>

      <title>Apparent nonreciprocal transport in FeSe bulk crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed low-frequency ac first- and second-harmonic resistance measurements and dc $I-V$ measurements on bulk FeSe crystals in a temperature range between 1.8 and 150 K and in magnetic field up to 14 T. We observed considerable second-harmonic resistance, indicative of nonreciprocal charge transport, in some samples. By examining correlation between contact resistances and second-harmonic signals, we concluded that the second-harmonic resistance was not due to the genuine nonreciprocal transport effect but was caused by joule heating at a current contact through the thermoelectric effect. Our conclusion is consistent with a recent preprint (Nagata \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2409.01715), in which the authors reported a zero-field superconducting diode effect in devices fabricated with FeSe flakes and attributed it to the thermoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective correlation effects and superconducting pairing symmetry in a multiorbital $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ raises key questions about its mechanism and the nature of pairing symmetry. This system is believed to be described by a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. The considerations of orbital-selective Mott correlations motivate a bilayer two-orbital $t$-$J$ model and, accordingly, we study the superconducting pairing in this model. We obtain an overall phase diagram of superconductivity, where the leading channel has either extended $s$-wave or $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. Our analysis highlights how the orbital-selective correlations affect the superconducting pairing via the interlayer exchange couplings and low-energy electronic structure. In particular, we find that the dominant orbital for the pairing may change between $z^2$ and $x^2-y^2$ when the position of the bonding $z^2$ band is varied by tuning either the $c$-axis lattice constant or electron concentration strength. We discuss the implications of these results for the superconductivity in both bulk La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and its thin film counterpart.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent dissipation effects in topological insulator-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipation fundamentally alters quantum transport in Josephson junctions. Here, we demonstrate unique transport signatures in dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junctions, which provide a powerful platform for exploring the competition between dissipation and topological protection. We incorporate dissipation effects by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead at the junction to an electron reservoir, and describe its effects using an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian within the Lindblad formalism. Non-Hermiticity introduces finite lifetimes to the helical Andreev bound states in the junction, with imaginary energy components that depend on the quasiparticle incidence angle, while Klein tunneling remains robust for normal incidence. Unlike `ordinary' non-Hermitian Josephson junctions, this system exhibits no Josephson gaps or forbidden regions, preserving topological protection. In the fully non-Hermitian regime, a tunable line of zero-energy states emerges, bounded by exceptional-like points with divergent supercurrents. Our results reveal how dissipation reshapes superconducting transport in topological insulator-based Josephson junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered hybrid quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode efficiency from singlet-triplet mixing in disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) -- the nonreciprocity of the critical current in a bulk superconductor -- has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in superconducting electronics. However, the role of disorder scattering in SDE has rarely been considered, despite its potential qualitative impact, as we demonstrate in this work. We investigate SDE in a disordered Rashba superconductor under an in-plane magnetic field, employing a self-consistent Born approximation to derive the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis reveals two surprising effects. First, in the weak Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) regime, disorder can reverse the direction of the diode effect, indicated by a sign change in the superconducting diode efficiency coefficient. Second, in the strong Rashba SOC regime, disorder becomes the driving mechanism of SDE, which vanishes in its absence. In this case, we show that disorder-induced mixing of singlet and triplet superconducting orders underlies the effect.</description>

      <title>Extended strange metal regime from superconducting puddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a model of mesoscale superconducting puddles in a metal, represented as dynamical impurities interacting with a finite number of electronic channels via Andreev and normal scattering. We identify conditions under which the collection of puddles make a $T$-linear contribution to the resistivity and a $T\ln(1/T)$ to the specific heat and thermopower. This behavior emerges in an intermediate temperature range that extends from an upper energy scale set by the renormalized charging energy of the puddles, and down to an exponentially small scale associated with a charge-Kondo crossover, provided that the number of electronic channels interacting with the puddle is large. The phenomenology of our model resembles the apparent extended strange metal regime observed in overdoped cuprates which exhibits $T$-linear resistivity at low $T$ over a finite range of doping. We also propose to engineer a strange metal from suitably designed superconducting grains in a metallic matrix.</description>

      <title>Signatures of two gaps in the spin susceptibility of a cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major obstacle to understanding high-Tc cuprates is that superconductivity precludes observing normal-state properties at low temperatures. One prime example is the normal-state spin susceptibility \c{hi}spin: although its decrease upon cooling far above Tc typifies pseudogap behavior, its behavior at low temperatures is generally unknown. Here, our measurements in high magnetic fields expose \c{hi}spin of YBa2Cu3Oy down to low temperatures. Even though superconductivity is suppressed by the field, we uncover two thermally-activated contributions alongside a residual \c{hi}spin(T=0) due to gapless excitations. We relate these two distinct gaps to short-range charge-density waves and to the formation of singlets as in certain quantum spin systems. Both phenomena thus contribute to the pseudogap at low temperature, supplementing short-lived antiferromagnetism that initiates pseudogap behavior at high temperatures. We therefore propose that the pseudogap ought to be regarded as a composite property and that, when not undergoing spin-stripe ordering, underdoped cuprates tend to form short-ranged spin singlets.</description>

      <title>Observation of thermal microwave photons with a Josephson junction detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.</description>
