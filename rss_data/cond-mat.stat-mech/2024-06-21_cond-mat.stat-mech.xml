      <title>Unconventional early-time relaxation in the Rydberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that unconventional relaxation dynamics of special initial states in one-dimensional arrays of Rydberg atoms produce non-generic decay of the initial-state survival probability at early times. Using the PXP hamiltonian as a minimal model of the Rydberg blockade, we prove that the early-time survival probability for states exhibiting quantum many-body scarring decays at a characteristic rate, whose finite-size scaling is determined solely by scars. We numerically investigate the effects of both revival-enhancing and ergodicity-restoring perturbations and find results consistent with the limiting cases of integrable and ergodic dynamics, respectively. Since the survival probability is easily accessible experimentally at early times, our findings enable us to probe the presence of scars at time scales much shorter than that of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Structural analysis of Gibbs states and metastates in short-range classical spin glasses: indecomposable metastates, dynamically-frozen states, and metasymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider short-range classical spin glasses, or other disordered systems, consisting of Ising spins. For a low-temperature Gibbs state in infinite size in such a system, for given random bonds, it is controversial whether its decomposition into pure states will be trivial or non-trivial. We undertake a general study of the overall structure of this problem, based on metastates, which are essential to prove the existence of a thermodynamic limit. A metastate is a probability distribution on Gibbs states, for given disorder, that satisfies certain covariance properties. First, we prove that any metastate can be decomposed as a mixture of indecomposable metastates, and that all Gibbs states drawn from an indecomposable metastate are alike macroscopically. Next, we consider stochastic stability of a metastate under random perturbations of the disorder, and prove that any metastate is stochastically stable. Dynamically-frozen states play a role in the analysis of Gibbs states drawn from a metastate, either as states or as parts of states. Using a mapping into real Hilbert space, we prove results about Gibbs states, and classify them into six types. Any indecomposable metastate has a compact symmetry group, though it may be trivial; we call this a metasymmetry. Metastate-average states are studied, and can be related to states arising dynamically at long times after a quench from high temperature, under some conditions. Many features that are permitted by general results are already present in replica symmetry breaking (RSB). Our results are for cases both with and without spin-flip symmetry of the Hamiltonian and, technically, we use mixed $p$-spin--interaction models.</description>

      <title>Self-organized transport in noisy dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of multi-commodity transport in a noisy, nonlinear network. The nonlinearity determines the dynamics of the edge capacities, which can be amplified or suppressed depending on the local current flowing across an edge. We consider network self-organization for three different nonlinear functions: For all three we identify parameter regimes where noise leads to self-organization into more robust topologies, that are not found by the sole noiseless dynamics. Moreover, the interplay between noise and specific functional behavior of the nonlinearity gives rise to different features, such as (i) continuous or discontinuous responses to the demand strength and (ii) either single or multi-stable solutions. Our study shows the crucial role of the activation function on noise-assisted phenomena.</description>

      <title>The inviscid fixed point of the multi-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new scaling regime characterized by a $z=1$ dynamical critical exponent has been reported in several numerical simulations of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and noisy Burgers equations. This scaling was found to emerge in the tensionless limit for the interface and in the inviscid limit for the fluid. Based on functional renormalization group, the origin of this scaling has been elucidated. It was shown to be controlled by a yet unpredicted fixed point of the one-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation, termed inviscid Burgers fixed point. The associated universal properties, including the scaling function, were calculated. Here, we generalize this analysis to the multi-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation. We show that the inviscid-Burgers fixed point exists in all dimensions $d$, and that it controls the large momentum behavior of the correlation functions in the inviscid limit. It turns out that it yields in all $d$ the same super-universal value $z=1$ for the dynamical exponent.</description>

      <title>Cellular Automata model for period-$n$ synchronization: A new universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are few known universality classes of absorbing phase transitions in one dimension and most models fall in the well-known directed percolation (DP) class. Synchronization is a transition to an absorbing state and this transition is often DP class. With local coupling, the transition is often to a fixed point state. Transitions to a periodic synchronized state are seldom observed. Recently a transition to a synchronized period-3 state that is not in DP class is observed. We model it using a cellular automata model with states 1 to $n$. The rules are a) Each site in state $i$ changes to state $i+1$ for $i&lt;n$ and 1 if $i=n$. b) After this update, it takes value of either neighbor unless it is in state 1. With these rules, we observe a transition to synchronization with critical exponents different from those of DP for $n&gt;2$. For $n=2$, a different exponent is observed.</description>

      <title>Starving Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we review recent results on the starving random walk (RW) problem, a minimal model for resource-limited exploration. Initially, each lattice site contains a single food unit, which is consumed upon visitation by the RW. The RW starves whenever it has not found any food unit within the previous $\mathcal{S}$ steps. To address this problem, the key observable corresponds to the inter-visit time $\tau_k$ defined as the time elapsed between the finding of the $k^\text{th}$ and the $(k+1)^\text{th}$ food unit. By characterizing the maximum $M_n$ of the inter-visit times $\tau_0,\dots,\tau_{n-1}$, we will see how to obtain the number $N_\mathcal{S}$ of food units collected at starvation, as well as the lifetime $T_\mathcal{S}$ of the starving RW.</description>

      <title>Application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity into the original theory of Haldane. It is shown that indistinguishability can be introduced as a form of external statistical correlation into distinguishable systems. It is proved that this modified statistical correlation theory can be used to derive classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES) using maximum entropy methods for a self-correlating system. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.</description>

      <title>Gaseous Diffusion as a Correlated Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13571v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean square displacement per collision of a molecule immersed in a gas at equilibrium is given by its mean square displacement between two consecutive collisions (mean square free path) corrected by a prefactor in the form of a series. The $n$-th term of the series is proportional to the mean value of the scalar product $\rb_1 \cdot \rb_{n}$, where $\rb_i$ is the displacement of the molecule between the $(i-1)$-th and $i$-th collisions. Simple arguments are used to obtain approximate expressions for each term. The key finding is that the ratio of consecutive terms in the series closely approximates the so-called mean persistence ratio. Exact expressions for the terms in the series are considered and their ratios for several consecutive terms are calculated for the case of hard spheres, showing an excellent agreement with the mean persistence ratio. These theoretical results are confirmed by solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. By summing the series, the mean square displacement and the diffusion coefficient can be determined using only two quantities: the mean square free path and the mean persistence ratio. A simple and an improved expression for the diffusion coefficient $D$ are considered and compared with the so-called first and second Sonine approximations to $D$ as well as with computer simulations of the Boltzmann equation. It is found that the improved diffusion coefficient shows very good agreement with simulation results over all intruder and molecule mass ranges. When the intruder mass is smaller than that of the gas molecules, the improved formula even outperforms the first Sonine approximation.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We further confirm this scenario of the hidden energy scale by numerical simulations of spins on the kagome lattice. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>A fractal geometry immersed in a hierarchical magnetic flux distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractal geometry presents us with a self-similarity in their pattern at various length scales that is prevalent in our natural world. We present theoretical model of a Sierpinski gasket (SPG) fractal geometry with a deterministic perturbation in the form of a hierarchical distribution of magnetic flux. Such flux configuration induces a deterministic disorder in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases picked up by the electron wavefunction. Using the tight-binding formalism, we show that by tunning the strength of the hierarchy parameter of those AB phases, one can systematically engineer quantum states in a SPG fractal lattice. In addition to this, we have also observed that by controlling the strength of this hierarchy parameter in the magnetic flux, one can effectively regulate the persistent current in the SPG fractal structure. This characteristic is found to be true for various filling factors. Our results could be useful for designing nanoelectronic devices using molecular fractal structures fabricated by chemical synthesis technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a numerical bootstrap study of scalar operators in the critical 3d Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models, a family of conformal field theories containing N Majorana fermions in the fundamental representation of an O(N) global symmetry. We compute rigorous bounds on the scaling dimensions of the next-to-lowest parity-even and parity-odd singlet scalars at N = 2, 4, and 8. All of these dimensions have lower bounds greater than 3, implying that there are only two relevant singlet scalars and placing constraints on the RG flow structure of these theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework to determine the upper bound to the complexity of a computing a given observable with respect to a Hamiltonian. By considering the Heisenberg evolution of the observable, we show that each Hamiltonian defines an equivalence relation, causing the operator space to be partitioned into equivalence classes. Any operator within a specific class never leaves its equivalence class during the evolution. We provide a method to determine the dimension of the equivalence classes and evaluate it for various models, such as the $ XY $ chain and Kitaev model on trees. Our findings reveal that the complexity of operator evolution in the $XY$ model grows from the edge to the bulk, which is physically manifested as suppressed relaxation of qubits near the boundary. Our methods are used to reveal several new cases of simulable quantum dynamics, including a $XY$-$ZZ$ model which cannot be reduced to free fermions.</description>

Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. We prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models with different parameters in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results are a broad generalization of the results of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model) with different parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical XY model has been consistently studied since it was introduced more than six decades ago. Of particular interest has been the two-dimensional spin model's exhibition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This topological phenomenon describes the transition from bound vortex-antivortex pairs at low temperatures to unpaired or isolated vortices and anti-vortices above some critical temperature. In this work we propose a novel machine learning based method to determine the emergence of this phase transition. An autoencoder was used to map states of the XY model into a lower dimensional latent space. Samples were taken from this latent space to determine the thermal average of the vortex density which was then used to determine the critical temperature of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Shape and Size Tunability of Sheets of Interlocked Ring Copolymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanically bonded membranes of interlocked ring polymers are a significant generalization of conventional elastic sheets, where connectivity is provided by covalent bonding, and represent a promising class of topological meta-materials. In this context, two open questions regard the large-scale reverberations of the heterogeneous composition of the rings and the inequivalent modes of interlocking neighboring rings. We address these questions with Langevin dynamics simulations of chainmails with honeycomb-lattice connectivity, where the rings are block copolymers with two segments of different rigidity. We considered various combinations of the relative lengths of the two segments and the patterns of the over- and under-passes linking neighboring rings. We find that varying ring composition and linking patterns have independent and complementary effects. While the former sets the overall size of the chainmail, the latter defines the shape, enabling the selection of starkly different conformation types. Notably, one of the considered linking patterns favors saddle-shaped membranes, providing a first example of spontaneous negative Gaussian curvature in mechanically bonded sheets. The results help establish the extent to which mechanically bonded membranes can differ from conventional elastic membranes, particularly for the achievable shape and size tunability.</description>

      <title>Chirality Effects in Molecular Chainmail</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of positive Gaussian curvature in kinetoplast DNA networks, we consider the effect of linking chirality in square lattice molecular chainmail networks using Langevin dynamics simulations and constrained gradient optimization. Linking chirality here refers to ordering of over-under versus under-over linkages between a loop and its neighbors. We consider fully alternating linking, maximally non-alternating, and partially non-alternating linking chiralities. We find that in simulations of polymer chainmail networks, the linking chirality dictates the sign of the Gaussian curvature of the final state of the chainmail membranes. Alternating networks have positive Gaussian curvature, similar to what is observed in kinetoplast DNA networks. Maximally non-alternating networks form isotropic membranes with negative Gaussian curvature. Partially non-alternating networks form flat diamond-shaped sheets which undergo a thermal folding transition when sufficiently large, similar to the crumpling transition in tethered membranes. We further investigate this topology-curvature relationship on geometric grounds by considering the tightest possible configurations and the constraints that must be satisfied to achieve them.</description>

      <title>Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise</title>

Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a novel non-equilibrium phase transition characterized by entanglement entropy. The scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements. However, common decoherence noises, such as dephasing, are detrimental to the volume law phase, posing a significant challenge for observing MIPT in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise. The conditional entanglement entropy is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as two competing external random fields. Then we show that an average apparatus-environment exchange symmetry ensures the conditional entanglement entropy is a valid probe of entanglement. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence on a (2+1)-d quantum circuit under dephasing noise, demonstrating that MIPT can indeed be observed with the aid of quantum-enhanced operations. This result not only serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise but also holds experimental relevance, as the protocol is straightforward to implement in practice.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation of dynamic cavity equations for linearly-coupled stochastic dynamics</title>

Abstract: Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.</description>

Abstract: Biomolecular condensates play a central role in the spatial organization of living matter. Their formation is now well understood as a form of liquid-liquid phase separation that occurs very far from equilibrium. For instance, they can be modeled as active droplets, where the combination of molecular interactions and chemical reactions result in microphase separation. However, so far, models of chemically active droplets are spatially continuous and deterministic. Therefore, the relationship between the microscopic parameters of the models and some crucial properties of active droplets (such as their polydispersity, their shape anisotropy, or their typical lifetime) is yet to be established. In this work, we address this question computationally, using Brownian dynamics simulations of chemically active droplets: the building blocks are represented explicitly as particles that interact with attractive or repulsive interactions, depending on whether they are in a droplet-forming state or not. Thanks to this microscopic and stochastic view of the problem, we reveal how driving the system away from equilibrium in a controlled way determines the fluctuations and dynamics of active emulsions.</description>

      <title>Cluster Formation induced by local dielectric saturation in Restricted Primitive Model Electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments using the Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) have found anomalously long ranged charge-charge underscreening in concentrated salt solutions. Meanwhile, theory and simulations have suggested ion clustering to be the possible origin of this behaviour. The popular Restricted Primitive Model of electrolyte solutions, in which the solvent is represented by a uniform relative dielectric constant, $\varepsilon_r$, is unable to resolve the anomalous underscreening seen in experiments. In this work, we modify the Restricted Primitive Model to account for local dielectric saturation within the ion hydration shell. The dielectric constant in our model locally decreases from the bulk value to a lower saturated value at the ionic surface. The parameters for the model are deduced so that typical salt solubilities are obtained. Our simulations for both bulk and slit geometries show that our model displays strong cluster formation and these give rise to long-ranged interactions between charged surfaces at distances similar to what has been observed in SFA measurements. An electrolyte model wherein the dielectric constant remains uniform does not display similar clusters, even with $\varepsilon_r$ equal to the saturated value at ion contact. Hence, the observed behaviours are not simply due to an enhanced Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>The superconducting clock-circuit: Improving the coherence of Josephson radiation beyond the thermodynamic uncertainty relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of superconducting electronics, the on-chip generation of AC radiation is essential for further advancements. Although a Josephson junction can emit AC radiation from a purely DC voltage bias, the coherence of this radiation is significantly limited by Johnson-Nyquist noise. We relate this limitation to the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. Recent findings indicate that the thermodynamic uncertainty relation can be broken by a classical pendulum clock. We demonstrate how the violation of the TUR can be used as a design principle for radiation sources by showing that a superconducting clock circuit emits coherent AC radiation from a DC bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the thermal one point function of higher spin currents in the critical model of $U(N)$ complex scalars interacting with a quartic potential and the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model of Dirac fermions at large $N$ and strong coupling using the Euclidean inversion formula. These models are considered in odd space time dimensions $d$ and held at finite temperature and finite real chemical potential $\mu$ measured in units of the temperature. We show that these one point functions simplify both at large spin and large $d$. At large spin, the one point functions behave as though the theory is free, the chemical potential appears through a simple pre-factor which is either $\cosh\mu$ or $\sinh\mu$ depending on whether the spin is even or odd. At large $d$, but at finite spin and chemical potential, the 1-point functions are suppressed exponentially in $d$ compared to the free theory. We study a fixed point of the critical Gross-Neveu model in $d=3$ with 1-point functions exhibiting a branch cut in the chemical potential plane. The critical exponent for the free energy or the pressure at the branch point is $3/2$ which coincides with the mean field exponent of the Lee-Yang edge singularity for repulsive core interactions.</description>

Abstract: Superstatistics generalizes Boltzmann statistics by assuming spatio-temporal fluctuations of the intensive variables. It has many applications in the analysis of experimental and simulated data. The fluctuation of the intensity variable is the key to the validity of superstatistical theory, but the law of its distribution is still unclear. In the framework of large deviation theory, we show that the fluctuation of the intensive variable of superstatistics emerges naturally from measurements in the large data limit. Combining Bayes' theorem, we demonstrate the conditional probability distribution of the intensity variable also follows the Boltzmann statistics and the conjugate variable of the intensive variable is the extensive variable, indicating a thermodynamic duality symmetry between conjugate variables in the superstatistical systems. A new thermodynamic relation between the entropy functions of conjugate variables is obtained. We utilized a simple Ising model with fluctuating temperature to verify the dual relationship between temperature and energy. Our work may contribute to the understanding of statistical physics in complex systems and Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Relation between Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Bose-Einstein distribution: Quantum principle for bosons, predicting a bosonic vacuum state of positive energy, a candidate for dark energy and dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain two fundamental conditions that characterize a thermal equilibrium between two energy levels: (i) the total energy must be equal in both levels and (ii) the temperature must be equal for all particles. Exploiting these two conditions, we derive a differential equation of thermal equilibrium that holds for all types of particles. Integration delivers the Boltzmann distribution, suggesting that it is the general distribution of thermal equilibrium. With the fermionic excited-state population number n2 and ground-state population number n1, Pauli's exclusion principle is formalized as n1 + n2 = 1. Exploiting Einstein's rate-equation approach to Planck's law of blackbody radiation and introducing a bosonic excited-state population number n2 and ground-state population number n1, we derive the quantum principle for bosons, n1 - n2 = 1. Utilizing either quantum principle in the integration of the differential equation of thermal equilibrium or entering either quantum principle into the Boltzmann distribution delivers the Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein distribution. The ratio of fermionic or bosonic population numbers, n2 / n1, follows the Boltzmann distribution. These results suggest that the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions are special cases of the Boltzmann distribution, ruled by Pauli's exclusion principle or the quantum principle for bosons. In the quantum principle for bosons, the right-hand side represents a vacuum state. Consequently, a populated vacuum state should exist for all bosons. In the same manner as the vacuum photon is undetectable, the vacuum states of all bosons should be undetectable; therefore, these states are dark states. The vacuum states of all bosons contribute to dark energy, while only the vacuum states of matter bosons contribute to dark matter, supporting the fact that the amount of dark energy exceeds that of dark matter in the universe.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the theoretical framework of stochastic thermodynamics has been revealed to be useful for macroscopic systems. However, despite its conceptual and practical importance, the connection to hydrodynamics has yet to be explored. In this Letter, we reformulate the thermodynamics of compressible and incompressible Newtonian fluids so that it becomes comparable to stochastic thermodynamics and unveil their connections; we obtain the housekeeping--excess decomposition of entropy production rate (EPR) for hydrodynamic systems and find a lower bound on EPR given by relative fluctuation similar to the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. These results not only prove the universality of stochastic thermodynamics but also suggest the potential extensibility of the thermodynamic theory of hydrodynamic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very recently, a fundamental observable has been introduced and analyzed to quantify the exploration of random walks: the time $\tau_k$ required for a random walk to find a site that it never visited previously, when the walk has already visited $k$ distinct sites. Here, we tackle the natural issue of the statistics of $M_n$, the longest duration out of $\tau_0,\dots,\tau_{n-1}$. This problem belongs to the active field of extreme value statistics, with the difficulty that the random variables $\tau_k$ are both correlated and non-identically distributed. Beyond this fundamental aspect, we show that the asymptotic determination of the statistics of $M_n$ finds explicit applications in foraging theory and allows us to solve the open $d$-dimensional starving random walk problem, in which each site of a lattice initially contains one food unit, consumed upon visit by the random walker, which can travel $\mathcal{S}$ steps without food before starving. Processes of diverse nature, including regular diffusion, anomalous diffusion, and diffusion in disordered media and fractals, share common properties within the same universality classes.</description>

Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing full record statistics, covering record counts $M(t_1), M(t_2), \ldots$, and their corresponding attainment times $T_{M(t_1)}, T_{M(t_2)}, \ldots$, as well as the intervals until the next record. From this multiple-time distribution, we derive general expressions for various observables related to record dynamics, including the conditional number of records given the number observed at a previous time and the conditional time required to reach the current record, given the occurrence time of the previous one. Our formalism is exemplified by a variety of stochastic processes, including biased nearest-neighbor random walks, asymmetric run-and-tumble dynamics, and random walks with stochastic resetting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider universal aspects of two problems: (i) the slow purification of a large number of qubits by repeated quantum measurements, and (ii) the singular value structure of a product ${m_t m_{t-1}\ldots m_1}$ of many large random matrices. Each kind of process is associated with the decay of natural measures of entropy as a function of time or of the number of matrices in the product. We argue that, for a broad class of models, each process is described by universal scaling forms for purification, and that (i) and (ii) represent distinct ``universality classes'' with distinct scaling functions. Using the replica trick, these universality classes correspond to one-dimensional effective statistical mechanics models for a gas of ``kinks'', representing domain walls between elements of the permutation group. (This is an instructive low-dimensional limit of the effective statistical mechanics models for random circuits and tensor networks.) These results apply to long-time purification in spatially local monitored circuit models on the entangled side of the measurement phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Partial resetting, whereby a state variable $x(t)$ is reset at random times to a value $a x (t)$, $0\leq a \leq 1$, generalizes conventional resetting by introducing the resetting strength $a$ as a parameter. Partial resetting generates a broad family of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) that interpolates between the conventional NESS at strong resetting ($a=0$) and a Gaussian distribution at weak resetting ($a \to 1$). Here, such resetting processes are studied from a thermodynamic perspective, and the mean cost associated with maintaining such NESS are derived. The resetting phase of the dynamics is implemented by a resetting potential $\Phi(x)$ that mediates the resets in finite time. By working in an ensemble of trajectories with a fixed number of resets, we study both the steady-state properties of the propagator and its moments. The thermodynamic work needed to sustain the resulting NESS is then investigated. We find that different resetting traps can give rise to rates of work with widely different dependencies on the resetting strength $a$. Surprisingly, in the case of resets mediated by a harmonic trap with otherwise free diffusive motion, the asymptotic rate of work is insensitive to the value of $a$. For general anharmonic traps, the asymptotic rate of work can be either increasing or decreasing as a function of the strength $a$, depending on the degree of anharmonicity. Counter to intuition, the rate of work can therefore in some cases increase as the resetting becomes weaker $(a\to 1)$ although the work vanishes at $a=1$. Work in the presence of a background potential is also considered. Numerical simulations confirm our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider overdamped Brownian particles with two degrees of freedom (DoF) that are confined in a time-varying quadratic potential and are in simultaneous contact with heat baths of different temperatures along the respective DoF. The anisotropy in thermal fluctuations can be used to extract work by suitably manipulating the confining potential. The question of what the maximal amount of work that can be extracted is has been raised in recent work, and has been computed under the simplifying assumption that the entropy of the distribution of particles (thermodynamic states) remains constant throughout a thermodynamic cycle. Indeed, it was shown that the maximal amount of work that can be extracted amounts to solving an isoperimetric problem, where the 2-Wasserstein length traversed by thermodynamic states quantifies dissipation that can be traded off against an area integral that quantifies work drawn out of the thermal anisotropy. Here, we remove the simplifying assumption on constancy of entropy. We show that the work drawn can be computed similarly to the case where the entropy is kept constant while the dissipation can be reduced by suitably tilting the thermodynamic cycle in a thermodynamic space with one additional dimension. Optimal cycles can be locally approximated by solutions to an isoperimetric problem in a tilted lower-dimensional subspace.</description>

Abstract: The Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) cycle is a paradigmatic model of endoreversible heat engines, which yields the so-called CA efficiency as the efficiency at maximum power. Due to the arbitrariness of the relationship between the steady temperature and the time taken for the isothermal process of the CA cycle, the constructions of the CA cycle on the thermodynamic plane are not unique. Here, we give some of the detailed constructions of the CA cycle on the thermodynamic plane, using an ideal gas as a working substance. It is shown that these constructions are equal to each other in the maximum power regime in the sense that they achieve the best trade-off between the work and the inverse cycle-time, known as the Pareto front in multi-objective optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium tricritical behaviour in anisotropic XY ferromagnet driven by elliptically polarised propagating magnetic field wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10975v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three dimensional anisotropic XY ferromagnet driven by elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave has been extensively investigated by Monte Carlo simulation with Metropolis single spin flip algorithm. Both the effects of the bilinear exchange type and the single site anisotropies are thoroughly investigated. The time average magnetisation (over the complete cycle of the elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave) components play the role of dynamic order parameter. For fixed set of values of the strength of anisotropy and the field amplitudes, the system has been found to get dynamically ordered at a pseudocritical temperature. The pseudocritical temperature of such dynamic nonequilibrium phase transition has been found to depend on both the strength of anisotropy and the amplitudes of the elliptically polarized propagating magnetic field wave. A comprehensive phase diagram is represented here in the form of image plot of the pseudocritical temperature in the plane formed by the strength of anisotropy and field amplitudes. Interestingly, this nonequilibrium phase transition has been found discontinuous (first order) for higher values of the field amplitude and lower values of the anisotropy. On the other hand, the continuous (second order) transition has been noticed for lower values of the field amplitude and higher values of the anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling critical behavior in three-dimensional lattice Abelian gauge models with charged $N$-component scalar fields and $SO(N)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional lattice Abelian Higgs gauge model for a charged $N$-component scalar field ${\phi}$, which is invariant under $SO(N)$ global transformations for generic values of the parameters. We focus on the strong-coupling regime, in which the kinetic Hamiltonian term for the gauge field is a small perturbation, which is irrelevant for the critical behavior. The Hamiltonian depends on a parameter $v$ which determines the global symmetry of the model and the symmetry of the low-temperature phases. We present renormalization-group predictions, based on a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson effective description that relies on the identification of the appropriate order parameter and on the symmetry-breaking patterns that occur at the strong-coupling phase transitions. For $v=0$, the global symmetry group of the model is $SU(N)$; the corresponding model may undergo continuous transitions only for $N=2$. For $v\not=0$, i.e., in the $SO(N)$ symmetric case, continuous transitions (in the Heisenberg universality class) are possible also for $N=3$ and 4. We perform Monte Carlo simulations for $N=2,3,4,6$, to verify the renormalization-group predictions. Finite-size scaling analyses of the numerical data are in full agreement.</description>

      <title>Unconventional U(1) to $\mathbf{Z_q}$ cross-over in quantum and classical ${\bf q}$-state clock models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03249v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional $q$-state quantum clock models with quantum fluctuations connecting states with clock transitions with different choices for matrix elements. We study the quantum phase transitions in these models using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, with the aim of characterizing the cross-over from emergent U(1) symmetry at the transition (for $q \ge 4$) to $Z_q$ symmetry of the ordered state. We also study classical three-dimensional clock models with spatial anisotropy corresponding to the space-time anisotropy of the quantum systems. The U(1) to ${Z_q}$ symmetry cross-over in all these systems is governed by a dangerously irrelevant operator. We specifically study $q=5$ and $q=6$ models with different forms of the quantum fluctuations and different anisotropies in the classical models. We find the expected classical XY critical exponents and scaling dimensions $y_q$ of the clock fields. However, the initial weak violation of the U(1) symmetry in the ordered phase, characterized by a $Z_q$ symmetric order parameter $\phi_q$, scales in an unexpected way. As a function of the system size $L$, close to the critical temperature $\phi_q \propto L^p$, where the known value of the exponent is $p=2$ in the classical isotropic clock model. In contrast, for strongly anisotropic classical models and the quantum models we find $p=3$. For weakly anisotropic classical models we observe a cross-over from $p=2$ to $p=3$ scaling. The exponent $p$ directly impacts the exponent $\nu'$ governing the divergence of the U(1) to $Z_q$ cross-over length scale $\xi'$ in the thermodynamic limit, according to the relationship $\nu'=\nu(1+|y_q|/p)$, where $\nu$ is the conventional correlation length exponent. We present a phenomenological argument based on an anomalous renormalization of the clock field in the presence of anisotropy, possibly as a consequence of topological (vortex) line defects.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Preserving Quadratic Lindbladian and Dissipation Driven Topological Transitions in Gaussian States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of an open quantum system can be governed by the Lindblad equation of the density matrix. In this paper, we propose to characterize the density matrix topology by the topological invariant of its modular Hamiltonian. Since the topological classification of such Hamiltonians depends on their symmetry classes, a primary issue we address is determining the requirement for the Lindbladian operators, under which the modular Hamiltonian can preserve its symmetry class during the dynamical evolution. We solve this problem for the fermionic Gaussian state and for the modular Hamiltonian being a quadratic operator of a set of fermionic operators. When these conditions are satisfied, along with a nontrivial topological classification of the symmetry class of the modular Hamiltonian, a topological transition can occur as time evolves. We present two examples of dissipation-driven topological transitions where the modular Hamiltonian lies in the AIII class with U(1) symmetry and the DIII class without U(1) symmetry. By a finite size scaling, we show that this density matrix topology transition occurs at a finite time. We also present the physical signature of this transition.</description>

      <title>Error Mitigation Thresholds in Noisy Random Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting useful information from noisy near-term quantum simulations requires error mitigation strategies. A broad class of these strategies rely on precise characterization of the noise source. \new{We study the robustness of probabilistic error cancellation and tensor network error mitigation when the noise is imperfectly characterized}. We adapt an Imry-Ma argument to predict the existence of a threshold in the robustness of these error mitigation methods for random spatially local circuits in spatial dimensions $D \geq 2$: noise characterization disorder below the threshold rate allows for error mitigation up to times that scale with the number of qubits. For one-dimensional circuits, by contrast, mitigation fails at an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time for any imperfection in the characterization of disorder. As a result, error mitigation is only a practical method for sufficiently well-characterized noise. We discuss further implications for tests of quantum computational advantage, fault-tolerant probes of measurement-induced phase transitions, and quantum algorithms in near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Linearizing Binary Optimization Problems Using Variable Posets for Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ising machines are next-generation computers expected to efficiently sample near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Combinatorial optimization problems are modeled as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems to apply an Ising machine. However, current state-of-the-art Ising machines still often fail to output near-optimal solutions due to the complicated energy landscape of QUBO problems. Furthermore, the physical implementation of Ising machines severely restricts the size of QUBO problems to be input as a result of limited hardware graph structures. In this study, we take a new approach to these challenges by injecting auxiliary penalties preserving the optimum, which reduces quadratic terms in QUBO objective functions. The process simultaneously simplifies the energy landscape of QUBO problems, allowing the search for near-optimal solutions, and makes QUBO problems sparser, facilitating encoding into Ising machines with restriction on the hardware graph structure. We propose linearization of QUBO problems using variable posets as an outcome of the approach. By applying the proposed method to synthetic QUBO instances and to multi-dimensional knapsack problems, we empirically validate the effects on enhancing minor-embedding of QUBO problems and the performance of Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Trotterization for time-dependent Hamiltonian quantum dynamics using piecewise conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation relies on Trotterization to discretize time evolution into elementary quantum gates. On current quantum processors with notable gate imperfections, there is a critical tradeoff between improved accuracy for finer timesteps, and increased error rate on account of the larger circuit depth. We present an adaptive Trotterization algorithm to cope with time-dependent Hamiltonians, where we propose a concept of piecewise "conserved" quantities to estimate errors in the time evolution between two (nearby) points in time; these allow us to bound the errors accumulated over the full simulation period. They reduce to standard conservation laws in the case of time-independent Hamiltonians, for which we first developed an adaptive Trotterization scheme [PRX Quantum 4, 030319]. We validate the algorithm for a time-dependent quantum spin chain, demonstrating that it can outperform the conventional Trotter algorithm with a fixed step size at a controlled error.</description>

Abstract: We propose a minimal setup for a quantum heat pump, consisting of two tunnel-coupled quantum dots, each hosting a single level and each being coupled to a different fermionic reservoir. The working principle relies on both non-Markovian system-bath coupling and driving induced resonant coupling. We describe the system using a reaction-coordinate mapping in combination with Floquet-Born-Markov theory and characterize its performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomly moving active particles can be herded into directed motion by asymmetric geometric structures. Although such a rectification process has been extensively studied due to its fundamental, biological, and technological relevance, a comprehensive understanding of active matter rectification based on single particle dynamics remains elusive. Here, by combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we study the directed transport and energetics of swimming bacteria navigating through funnel-shaped obstacles -- a paradigmatic model of rectification of living active matter. We develop a microscopic parameter-free model for bacterial rectification, which quantitatively explains experimental and numerical observations and predicts the optimal geometry for the maximum rectification efficiency. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of time irreversibility and measure the extractable work associated with bacterial rectification. Our study provides quantitative solutions to long-standing questions on bacterial rectification and establishes a generic relationship between time irreversibility, particle fluxes, and extractable work, shedding light on the energetics of non-equilibrium rectification processes in living systems.</description>

      <title>Poles, Shocks and Tygers: The Time-reversible Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a formally time-reversible, one-dimensional forced Burgers equation by imposing a global constraint of energy conservation, wherein the constant viscosity is modified to a fluctuating state-dependent dissipation coefficient. The system exhibits dynamical properties which bear strong similarities with those observed for the Burgers equation and can be understood using the dynamics of the poles, shocks, and truncation effects, such as tygers. A complex interplay of these give rise to interesting statistical regimes ranging from hydrodynamic behavior to a completely thermalized warm phase. The end of the hydrodynamic regime is associated with the appearance of a shock in the solution and a continuous transition leading to a truncation-dependent state. Beyond this, the truncation effects such as tygers and the appearance of secondary discontinuity at the resonance point in the solution strongly influence the statistical properties. These disappear at the second transition, at which the global quantities exhibit a jump and attain values that are consistent with the establishment of a quasiequilibrium state characterized by energy equipartition among the Fourier modes. Our comparative analysis shows that the macroscopic statistical properties of the formally time-reversible system and the Burgers equation are equivalent in all the regimes, irrespective of the truncation effects, and this equivalence is not just limited to the hydrodynamic regime, thereby further strengthening the Gallavotti's equivalence conjecture. The properties of the system are further examined by inspecting the complex space singularities in the velocity field of the Burgers equation. Furthermore, an effective theory is proposed to describe the discontinuous transition.</description>

      <title>Exact transport coefficients from the inelastic rough Maxwell model of a granular gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Granular gases demand models capable of capturing their distinct characteristics. The widely employed inelastic hard-sphere model (IHSM) introduces complexities that are compounded when incorporating realistic features like surface roughness and rotational degrees of freedom, resulting in the more intricate inelastic rough hard-sphere model (IRHSM). This paper focuses on the inelastic rough Maxwell model (IRMM), presenting a more tractable alternative to the IRHSM and enabling exact solutions. Building on the foundation of the inelastic Maxwell model (IMM) applied to granular gases, the IRMM extends the mathematical representation to encompass surface roughness and rotational degrees of freedom. The primary objective is to provide exact expressions for the Navier--Stokes--Fourier transport coefficients within the IRMM, including the shear and bulk viscosities, the thermal and diffusive heat conductivities, and the cooling-rate transport coefficient. In contrast to earlier approximations in the IRHSM, our study unveils inherent couplings, such as shear viscosity to spin viscosity and heat conductivities to counterparts associated with a torque-vorticity vector. These exact findings provide valuable insights into refining the Sonine approximation applied to the IRHSM, contributing to a deeper understanding of the transport properties in granular gases with realistic features.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Thermodynamic Dissipation of Linear Langevin Systems via Oscillatory Modes and Its Application to Neural Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics have elucidated various relations between the entropy production rate (thermodynamic dissipation) and the physical limits of information processing in nonequilibrium dynamical systems. These findings have opened new perspectives in analyzing real biological systems. In neuroscience, the importance of quantifying entropy production has attracted attention for understanding information processing in the brain. However, the relationship between the entropy production rate and oscillations, which are common in many biological systems, remains unclear. For instance, neural oscillations like delta, theta, and alpha waves play crucial roles in brain information processing. Here, we derive a novel decomposition of the entropy production rate of linear Langevin systems. We show that one component of the entropy production rate, called the housekeeping entropy production rate, can be decomposed into independent positive contributions from oscillatory modes. Our decomposition enables us to calculate the contribution of oscillatory modes to the housekeeping entropy production rate. In addition, when the noise matrix is diagonal, the contribution of each oscillatory mode can be further decomposed into the contribution of each system element. To demonstrate the utility of our decomposition, we applied it to an electrocorticography (ECoG) dataset recorded during awake and anesthetized conditions in monkeys, where the oscillatory properties change drastically. We showed consistent trends across different monkeys: the contribution of delta band was larger in the anesthetized condition than in the awake condition, while those from higher frequency bands, such as the theta band, were smaller. These results allow us to interpret the changes in neural oscillation in terms of stochastic thermodynamics and the physical limits of information processing.</description>

      <title>Delayed interactions in the noisy voter model through the periodic polling mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of delayed interactions on the stationary distribution of the noisy voter model. We assume that the delayed interactions occur through the periodic polling mechanism and replace the original instantaneous two-agent interactions. In our analysis, we require that the polling period aligns with the delay in announcing poll outcomes. As expected, when the polling period is relatively short, the model with delayed interactions is almost equivalent to the original model. As the polling period increases, oscillatory behavior emerges, but the model with delayed interactions still converges to stationary distribution. The stationary distribution resembles a Beta-binomial distribution, with its shape parameters scaling with the polling period. The observed scaling behavior is non-monotonic. Namely, the shape parameters peak at some intermediate polling period.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of the Mayer Series Coefficients for a Dimer Gas on a Rectangular Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05388v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper continues and complements the research in the earlier version of this paper (essentially Part 3 and Part 4 herein.) We now assume as suggested at the end of Part 4 that $b(n)$ is asymptotically of the form in eq.(A1).
  \begin{equation}\label{A1} \tag{A1}
  b(n) \sim \exp{( k_{-1} n + k_{0} ln(n) + \frac{k_{1}}{n} + \frac{k_{2}}{n^{2}}...)} \end{equation} Using the details of the six approximations used in Part 3, corresponding to the six values of $r$, $ 1 \leq r \leq 6$, in dimensions $d$ equal $2$. $3$, $5$, $11$ and $20$ we find in Part 1 an approximate value for the right side of eq.(A1) keeping the three terms in the exponent in $k_{-1}$, $k_{0}$, and $k_{1}$. In the range $5 \leq n \leq 20$ the two sides of eq.(A1) may be said to agree roughly to 5 parts per 100. ( With an appropriate choice of a constant of proportionality. )
  In Part 2 an approximation is found keeping the term in $k_{2}$ also that may be said to agree to 5 parts in 1000 in the range $8 \leq n \leq 20$. Not only is it amazing that the relation in eq.(A1) seems to hold, it is equally amazing that it is so accurate for such small values of $n$.</description>

      <title>Replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses in the replica-free Keldysh formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At asymptotically late times ultrametricity can emerge from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. We show that this suffices to recover the breaking of replica symmetry in mean-field spin glasses from the late time limit of the time evolution using the Keldysh path integral. This provides an alternative approach to replica symmetry breaking by connecting it rigorously to the dynamic formulation. Stationary spin glasses are thereby understood to spontaneously break thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We demonstrate our general statements for the spherical quantum $p$-spin model and the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the presence of transverse and longitudinal fields. In doing so, we also derive their dynamical Ginzburg-Landau effective Keldysh actions starting from microscopic quantum models.</description>

Abstract: The critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation gives a lower bound of the true critical inverse temperature in a broad class of ferromagnetic spin models, which is called the mean-field bound for the critical temperature. In this study, we explore the possibility of a corresponding mean-field bound for the critical temperature in Ising spin-glass models with Gaussian randomness on the Nishimori line. On the Nishimori line, the critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation is given by $\beta_{MF}^{NL}=\sqrt{1/z}$, where $z$ denotes the coordination number. Using the Griffiths inequalities on the Nishimori line, we prove that there is zero spontaneous magnetization in the high-temperature region $\beta &lt; \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. In other words, the true critical inverse temperature $\beta_c^{NL}$ of the Nishimori line is always bounded by $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in obtaining the corresponding mean-field bound $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line.</description>
