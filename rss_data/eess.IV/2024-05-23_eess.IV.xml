      <title>A Novel Feature Map Enhancement Technique Integrating Residual CNN and Transformer for Alzheimer Diseases Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer diseases (ADs) involves cognitive decline and abnormal brain protein accumulation, necessitating timely diagnosis for effective treatment. Therefore, CAD systems leveraging deep learning advancements have demonstrated success in AD detection but pose computational intricacies and the dataset minor contrast, structural, and texture variations. In this regard, a novel hybrid FME-Residual-HSCMT technique is introduced, comprised of residual CNN and Transformer concepts to capture global and local fine-grained AD analysis in MRI. This approach integrates three distinct elements: a novel CNN Meet Transformer (HSCMT), customized residual learning CNN, and a new Feature Map Enhancement (FME) strategy to learn diverse morphological, contrast, and texture variations of ADs. The proposed HSCMT at the initial stage utilizes stem convolution blocks that are integrated with CMT blocks followed by systematic homogenous and structural (HS) operations. The customized CMT block encapsulates each element with global contextual interactions through multi-head attention and facilitates computational efficiency through lightweight. Moreover, inverse residual and stem CNN in customized CMT enables effective extraction of local texture information and handling vanishing gradients. Furthermore, in the FME strategy, residual CNN blocks utilize TL-based generated auxiliary and are combined with the proposed HSCMT channels at the target level to achieve diverse enriched feature space. Finally, diverse enhanced channels are fed into a novel spatial attention mechanism for optimal pixel selection to reduce redundancy and discriminate minor contrast and texture inter-class variation. The proposed achieves an F1-score (98.55%), an accuracy of 98.42% and a sensitivity of 98.50%, a precision of 98.60% on the standard Kaggle dataset, and demonstrates outperformance existing ViTs and CNNs methods.</description>

      <title>Dose-aware Diffusion Model for 3D Low-dose PET: Multi-institutional Validation with Reader Study and Real Low-dose Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As PET imaging is accompanied by radiation exposure and potentially increased cancer risk, reducing radiation dose in PET scans without compromising the image quality is an important topic. Deep learning (DL) techniques have been investigated for low-dose PET imaging. However, existing models have often resulted in compromised image quality when achieving low-dose PET and have limited generalizability to different image noise-levels, acquisition protocols, patient populations, and hospitals. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the new state-of-the-art generative model to generate high-quality samples and have demonstrated strong potential for medical imaging tasks. However, for low-dose PET imaging, existing diffusion models failed to generate consistent 3D reconstructions, unable to generalize across varying noise-levels, often produced visually-appealing but distorted image details, and produced images with biased tracer uptake. Here, we develop DDPET-3D, a dose-aware diffusion model for 3D low-dose PET imaging to address these challenges. Collected from 4 medical centers globally with different scanners and clinical protocols, we extensively evaluated the proposed model using a total of 9,783 18F-FDG studies (1,596 patients) with low-dose/low-count levels ranging from 1% to 50%. With a cross-center, cross-scanner validation, the proposed DDPET-3D demonstrated its potential to generalize to different low-dose levels, different scanners, and different clinical protocols. As confirmed with reader studies performed by nuclear medicine physicians, the proposed method produced superior denoised results that are comparable to or even better than the 100% full-count images as well as previous DL baselines. The presented results show the potential of achieving low-dose PET while maintaining image quality. Lastly, a group of real low-dose scans was also included for evaluation.</description>

      <title>TauAD: MRI-free Tau Anomaly Detection in PET Imaging via Conditioned Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of tau PET imaging over the last decade has enabled Alzheimer's disease (AD) researchers to examine tau pathology in vivo and more effectively characterize the disease trajectories of AD. Current tau PET analysis methods, however, typically perform inferences on large cortical ROIs and are limited in the detection of localized tau pathology that varies across subjects. Furthermore, a high-resolution MRI is required to carry out conventional tau PET analysis, which is not commonly acquired in clinical practices and may not be acquired for many elderly patients with dementia due to strong motion artifacts, claustrophobia, or certain metal implants. In this work, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model to perform MRI-free anomaly detection from tau PET imaging data. By including individualized conditions and two complementary loss maps from pseudo-healthy and pseudo-unhealthy reconstructions, our model computes an anomaly map across the entire brain area that allows simply training a support vector machine (SVM) for classifying disease severity. We train our model on ADNI subjects (n=534) and evaluate its performance on a separate dataset from the preclinical subjects of the A4 clinical trial (n=447). We demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline generative models and the conventional Z-score-based method in anomaly localization without mis-detecting off-target bindings in sub-cortical and out-of-brain areas. By classifying the A4 subjects according to their anomaly map using the SVM trained on ADNI data, we show that our method can successfully group preclinical subjects with significantly different cognitive functions, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in capturing biologically relevant anomaly in tau PET imaging.</description>

      <title>Geometric Transformation Uncertainty for Improving 3D Fetal Brain Pose Prediction from Freehand 2D Ultrasound Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately localizing two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound (US) fetal brain images in the 3D brain, using minimal computational resources, is an important task for automated US analysis of fetal growth and development. We propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning model for automated 3D plane localization in 2D fetal brain images. Specifically, a multi-head network is trained to jointly regress 3D plane pose from 2D images in terms of different geometric transformations. The model explicitly learns to predict uncertainty to allocate higher weight to inputs with low variances across different transformations to improve performance. Our proposed method, QAERTS, demonstrates superior pose estimation accuracy than the state-of-the-art and most of the uncertainty-based approaches, leading to 9% improvement on plane angle (PA) for localization accuracy, and 8% on normalized cross-correlation (NCC) for sampled image quality. QAERTS also demonstrates efficiency, containing 5$\times$ fewer parameters than ensemble-based approach, making it advantageous in resource-constrained settings. In addition, QAERTS proves to be more robust to noise effects observed in freehand US scanning by leveraging rotational discontinuities and explicit output uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Spatial Matching of 2D Mammography Images and Specimen Radiographs: Towards Improved Characterization of Suspicious Microcalcifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of suspicious microcalcifications is critical to determine whether these calcifications are associated with invasive disease. Our overarching objective is to enable the joint characterization of microcalcifications and surrounding breast tissue using mammography images and digital histopathology images. Towards this goal, we investigate a template matching-based approach that utilizes microcalcifications as landmarks to match radiographs taken of biopsy core specimens to groups of calcifications that are visible on mammography. Our approach achieved a high negative predictive value (0.98) but modest precision (0.66) and recall (0.58) in identifying the mammographic region where microcalcifications were taken during a core needle biopsy.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Multihead Attentive Unet-3D for Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is a critical task in medical image analysis, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment planning of brain tumor patients. The importance of automated and accurate brain tumor segmentation cannot be overstated. It enables medical professionals to precisely delineate tumor regions, assess tumor growth or regression, and plan targeted treatments. Various deep learning-based techniques proposed in the literature have made significant progress in this field, however, they still face limitations in terms of accuracy due to the complex and variable nature of brain tumor morphology. In this research paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Multihead Attentive U-Net architecture, to address the challenges in accurate brain tumor segmentation, and to capture complex spatial relationships and subtle tumor boundaries. The U-Net architecture has proven effective in capturing contextual information and feature representations, while attention mechanisms enhance the model's ability to focus on informative regions and refine the segmentation boundaries. By integrating these two components, our proposed architecture improves accuracy in brain tumor segmentation. We test our proposed model on the BraTS 2020 benchmark dataset and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art well-known SegNet, FCN-8s, and Dense121 U-Net architectures. The results show that our proposed model outperforms the others in terms of the evaluated performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction Using Deep Learning for Agricultural and Biological Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has become a key technology for non-invasive quality evaluation in various fields, offering detailed insights through spatial and spectral data. Despite its efficacy, the complexity and high cost of HSI systems have hindered their widespread adoption. This study addressed these challenges by exploring deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction from RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images, particularly for agricultural products. Specifically, different hyperspectral reconstruction algorithms, such as Hyperspectral Convolutional Neural Network - Dense (HSCNN-D), High-Resolution Network (HRNET), and Multi-Scale Transformer Plus Plus (MST++), were compared to assess the dry matter content of sweet potatoes. Among the tested reconstruction methods, HRNET demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest mean relative absolute error (MRAE) of 0.07, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03, and the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 32.28 decibels (dB). Some key features were selected using the genetic algorithm (GA), and their importance was interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were developed using the RGB, reconstructed, and ground truth (GT) data. The visual and spectra quality of these reconstructed methods was compared with GT data, and predicted maps were generated. The results revealed the prospect of deep learning-based hyperspectral image reconstruction as a cost-effective and efficient quality assessment tool for agricultural and biological applications.</description>

      <title>Low-Resolution Chest X-ray Classification via Knowledge Distillation and Multi-task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research addresses the challenges of diagnosing chest X-rays (CXRs) at low resolutions, a common limitation in resource-constrained healthcare settings. High-resolution CXR imaging is crucial for identifying small but critical anomalies, such as nodules or opacities. However, when images are downsized for processing in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, vital spatial details and receptive fields are lost, hampering diagnosis accuracy. To address this, this paper presents the Multilevel Collaborative Attention Knowledge (MLCAK) method. This approach leverages the self-attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViT) to transfer critical diagnostic knowledge from high-resolution images to enhance the diagnostic efficacy of low-resolution CXRs. MLCAK incorporates local pathological findings to boost model explainability, enabling more accurate global predictions in a multi-task framework tailored for low-resolution CXR analysis. Our research, utilizing the Vindr CXR dataset, shows a considerable enhancement in the ability to diagnose diseases from low-resolution images (e.g. 28 x 28), suggesting a critical transition from the traditional reliance on high-resolution imaging (e.g. 224 x 224).</description>

      <title>Adaptive Wireless Image Semantic Transmission and Over-The-Air Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has undergone considerable evolution due to the recent rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), significantly enhancing both communication robustness and efficiency. Despite these advancements, most current semantic communication methods for image transmission pay little attention to the differing importance of objects and backgrounds in images. To address this issue, we propose a novel scheme named ASCViT-JSCC, which utilizes vision transformers (ViTs) integrated with an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. This scheme adaptively allocates bandwidth for objects and backgrounds in images according to the importance order of different parts determined by object detection of you only look once version 5 (YOLOv5) and feature points detection of scale invariant feature transform (SIFT). Furthermore, the proposed scheme adheres to digital modulation standards by incorporating quantization modules. We validate this approach through an over-the-air (OTA) testbed named intelligent communication prototype validation platform (ICP) based on a software-defined radio (SDR) and NVIDIA embedded kits. Our findings from both simulations and practical measurements show that ASCViT-JSCC significantly preserves objects in images and enhances reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach to Multi-Fiber Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification in Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is the primary imaging modality used to study brain microstructure in vivo. Reliable and computationally efficient parameter inference for common dMRI biophysical models is a challenging inverse problem, due to factors such as variable dimensionalities (reflecting the unknown number of distinct white matter fiber populations in a voxel), low signal-to-noise ratios, and non-linear forward models. These challenges have led many existing methods to use biologically implausible simplified models to stabilize estimation, for instance, assuming shared microstructure across all fiber populations within a voxel. In this work, we introduce a novel sequential method for multi-fiber parameter inference that decomposes the task into a series of manageable subproblems. These subproblems are solved using deep neural networks tailored to problem-specific structure and symmetry, and trained via simulation. The resulting inference procedure is largely amortized, enabling scalable parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification across all model parameters. Simulation studies and real imaging data analysis using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) demonstrate the advantages of our method over standard alternatives. In the case of the standard model of diffusion, our results show that under HCP-like acquisition schemes, estimates for extra-cellular parallel diffusivity are highly uncertain, while those for the intra-cellular volume fraction can be estimated with relatively high precision.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Lymphocyte Detection in Breast Cancer Whole Slide Imaging through Data-Centric Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and precise quantification of lymphocytes in histopathology slides is imperative for the characterization of the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy response insights. We developed a data-centric optimization pipeline that attain great lymphocyte detection performance using an off-the-shelf YOLOv5 model, without any architectural modifications. Our contribution that rely on strategic dataset augmentation strategies, includes novel biological upsampling and custom visual cohesion transformations tailored to the unique properties of tissue imagery, and enables to dramatically improve model performances. Our optimization reveals a pivotal realization: given intensive customization, standard computational pathology models can achieve high-capability biomarker development, without increasing the architectural complexity. We showcase the interest of this approach in the context of breast cancer where our strategies lead to good lymphocyte detection performances, echoing a broadly impactful paradigm shift. Furthermore, our data curation techniques enable crucial histological analysis benchmarks, highlighting improved generalizable potential.</description>

      <title>A label-free and data-free training strategy for vasculature segmentation in serial sectioning OCT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serial sectioning Optical Coherence Tomography (sOCT) is a high-throughput, label free microscopic imaging technique that is becoming increasingly popular to study post-mortem neurovasculature. Quantitative analysis of the vasculature requires highly accurate segmentation; however, sOCT has low signal-to-noise-ratio and displays a wide range of contrasts and artifacts that depend on acquisition parameters. Furthermore, labeled data is scarce and extremely time consuming to generate. Here, we leverage synthetic datasets of vessels to train a deep learning segmentation model. We construct the vessels with semi-realistic splines that simulate the vascular geometry and compare our model with realistic vascular labels generated by constrained constructive optimization. Both approaches yield similar Dice scores, although with very different false positive and false negative rates. This method addresses the complexity inherent in OCT images and paves the way for more accurate and efficient analysis of neurovascular structures.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dataset Multi-Task Learning for COVID-19 Prognosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging artificial intelligence to predict disease outcomes from chest radiographic images represents a significant scientific aim. The challenge, however, lies in the scarcity of large, labeled datasets with compatible tasks for training deep learning models without leading to overfitting. Addressing this issue, we introduce a novel multi-dataset multi-task training framework that predicts COVID-19 prognostic outcomes from chest X-rays (CXR) by integrating correlated datasets from disparate sources, distant from conventional multi-task learning approaches, which rely on datasets with multiple and correlated labeling schemes. Our framework hypothesizes that assessing severity scores enhances the model's ability to classify prognostic severity groups, thereby improving its robustness and predictive power. The proposed architecture comprises a deep convolutional network that receives inputs from two publicly available CXR datasets, AIforCOVID for severity prognostic prediction and BRIXIA for severity score assessment, and branches into task-specific fully connected output networks. Moreover, we propose a multi-task loss function, incorporating an indicator function, to exploit multi-dataset integration. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through significant performance improvements in prognosis classification tasks across 18 different convolutional neural network backbones in different evaluation strategies. This improvement is evident over single-task baselines and standard transfer learning strategies, supported by extensive statistical analysis, showing great application potential.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image super-resolution algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction for Predicting Chick Embryo Mortality Towards Advancing Egg and Hatchery Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for food surges and the agricultural sector undergoes a transformative shift towards sustainability and efficiency, the need for precise and proactive measures to ensure the health and welfare of livestock becomes paramount. In the context of the broader agricultural landscape outlined, the application of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) takes on profound significance. HSI has emerged as a cutting-edge, non-destructive technique for fast and accurate egg quality analysis, including the detection of chick embryo mortality. However, the high cost and operational complexity compared to conventional RGB imaging are significant bottlenecks in the widespread adoption of HSI technology. To overcome these hurdles and unlock the full potential of HSI, a promising solution is hyperspectral image reconstruction from standard RGB images. This study aims to reconstruct hyperspectral images from RGB images for non-destructive early prediction of chick embryo mortality. Firstly, the performance of different image reconstruction algorithms, such as HRNET, MST++, Restormer, and EDSR were compared to reconstruct the hyperspectral images of the eggs in the early incubation period. Later, the reconstructed spectra were used to differentiate live from dead chick-producing eggs using the XGBoost and Random Forest classification methods. Among the reconstruction methods, HRNET showed impressive reconstruction performance with MRAE of 0.0955, RMSE of 0.0159, and PSNR of 36.79 dB. This study motivated that harnessing imaging technology integrated with smart sensors and data analytics has the potential to improve automation, enhance biosecurity, and optimize resource management towards sustainable agriculture 4.0.</description>

      <title>I2I-Mamba: Multi-modal medical image synthesis via selective state space modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models comprising transformer components have pushed the performance envelope in medical image synthesis tasks. Contrary to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that use static, local filters, transformers use self-attention mechanisms to permit adaptive, non-local filtering to sensitively capture long-range context. However, this sensitivity comes at the expense of substantial model complexity, which can compromise learning efficacy particularly on relatively modest-sized imaging datasets. Here, we propose a novel adversarial model for multi-modal medical image synthesis, I2I-Mamba, that leverages selective state space modeling (SSM) to efficiently capture long-range context while maintaining local precision. To do this, I2I-Mamba injects channel-mixed Mamba (cmMamba) blocks in the bottleneck of a convolutional backbone. In cmMamba blocks, SSM layers are used to learn context across the spatial dimension and channel-mixing layers are used to learn context across the channel dimension of feature maps. Comprehensive demonstrations are reported for imputing missing images in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols. Our results indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior performance against state-of-the-art CNN- and transformer-based methods in synthesizing target-modality images.</description>

      <title>Multi-modality Regional Alignment Network for Covid X-Ray Survival Prediction and Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, advanced automated technologies have emerged as valuable tools to aid healthcare professionals in managing an increased workload by improving radiology report generation and prognostic analysis. This study proposes Multi-modality Regional Alignment Network (MRANet), an explainable model for radiology report generation and survival prediction that focuses on high-risk regions. By learning spatial correlation in the detector, MRANet visually grounds region-specific descriptions, providing robust anatomical regions with a completion strategy. The visual features of each region are embedded using a novel survival attention mechanism, offering spatially and risk-aware features for sentence encoding while maintaining global coherence across tasks. A cross LLMs alignment is employed to enhance the image-to-text transfer process, resulting in sentences rich with clinical detail and improved explainability for radiologist. Multi-center experiments validate both MRANet's overall performance and each module's composition within the model, encouraging further advancements in radiology report generation research emphasizing clinical interpretation and trustworthiness in AI models applied to medical studies. The code is available at https://github.com/zzs95/MRANet.</description>

      <title>M2ANET: Mobile Malaria Attention Network for efficient classification of plasmodium parasites in blood cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, which poses a significant public health challenge worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Timely and accurate detection of malaria parasites in blood cells is crucial for effective treatment and control of the disease. In recent years, deep learning techniques have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image analysis tasks, offering promising avenues for improving diagnostic accuracy, with limited studies on hybrid mobile models due to the complexity of combining two distinct models and the significant memory demand of self-attention mechanism especially for edge devices. In this study, we explore the potential of designing a hybrid mobile model for efficient classification of plasmodium parasites in blood cell images. Therefore, we present M2ANET (Mobile Malaria Attention Network). The model integrates MBConv3 (MobileNetV3 blocks) for efficient capturing of local feature extractions within blood cell images and a modified global-MHSA (multi-head self-attention) mechanism in the latter stages of the network for capturing global context. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark, we demonstrate that M2ANET outperforms some state-of-the-art lightweight and mobile networks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we discuss the potential implications of M2ANET in advancing malaria diagnosis and treatment, highlighting its suitability for deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings. The development of M2ANET represents a significant advancement in the pursuit of efficient and accurate malaria detection, with broader implications for medical image analysis and global healthcare initiatives.</description>

      <title>Automatic diagnosis of cardiac magnetic resonance images based on semi-supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a pivotal tool for assessing cardiac function. Precise segmentation of cardiac structures is imperative for accurate cardiac functional evaluation. This paper introduces a semi-supervised model for automatic segmentation of cardiac images and auxiliary diagnosis. By harnessing cardiac MRI images and necessitating only a small portion of annotated image data, the model achieves fully automated, high-precision segmentation of cardiac images, extraction of features, calculation of clinical indices, and prediction of diseases. The provided segmentation results, clinical indices, and prediction outcomes can aid physicians in diagnosis, thereby serving as auxiliary diagnostic tools. Experimental results showcase that this semi-supervised model for automatic segmentation of cardiac images and auxiliary diagnosis attains high accuracy in segmentation and correctness in prediction, demonstrating substantial practical guidance and application value.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Image Diffusion: Generating Image Sequence and Application in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive imaging modality. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing image quality with imaging speed. This trade-off is primarily constrained by k-space measurements, which traverse specific trajectories in the spatial Fourier domain (k-space). These measurements are often undersampled to shorten acquisition times, resulting in image artifacts and compromised quality. Generative models learn image distributions and can be used to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled k-space data. In this work, we present the autoregressive image diffusion (AID) model for image sequences and use it to sample the posterior for accelerated MRI reconstruction. The algorithm incorporates both undersampled k-space and pre-existing information. Models trained with fastMRI dataset are evaluated comprehensively. The results show that the AID model can robustly generate sequentially coherent image sequences. In 3D and dynamic MRI, the AID can outperform the standard diffusion model and reduce hallucinations, due to the learned inter-image dependencies.</description>

      <title>I$^2$VC: A Unified Framework for Intra- \&amp; Inter-frame Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video compression aims to reconstruct seamless frames by encoding the motion and residual information from existing frames. Previous neural video compression methods necessitate distinct codecs for three types of frames (I-frame, P-frame and B-frame), which hinders a unified approach and generalization across different video contexts. Intra-codec techniques lack the advanced Motion Estimation and Motion Compensation (MEMC) found in inter-codec, leading to fragmented frameworks lacking uniformity. Our proposed \textbf{Intra- \&amp; Inter-frame Video Compression (I$^2$VC)} framework employs a single spatio-temporal codec that guides feature compression rates according to content importance. This unified codec transforms the dependence across frames into a conditional coding scheme, thus integrating intra- and inter-frame compression into one cohesive strategy. Given the absence of explicit motion data, achieving competent inter-frame compression with only a conditional codec poses a challenge. To resolve this, our approach includes an implicit inter-frame alignment mechanism. With the pre-trained diffusion denoising process, the utilization of a diffusion-inverted reference feature rather than random noise supports the initial compression state. This process allows for selective denoising of motion-rich regions based on decoded features, facilitating accurate alignment without the need for MEMC. Our experimental findings, across various compression configurations (AI, LD and RA) and frame types, prove that I$^2$VC outperforms the state-of-the-art perceptual learned codecs. Impressively, it exhibits a 58.4\% enhancement in perceptual reconstruction performance when benchmarked against the H.266/VVC standard (VTM).

      <title>Domain-specific augmentations with resolution agnostic self-attention mechanism improves choroid segmentation in optical coherence tomography images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choroid is a key vascular layer of the eye, supplying oxygen to the retinal photoreceptors. Non-invasive enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) has recently improved access and visualisation of the choroid, making it an exciting frontier for discovering novel vascular biomarkers in ophthalmology and wider systemic health. However, current methods to measure the choroid often require use of multiple, independent semi-automatic and deep learning-based algorithms which are not made open-source. Previously, Choroidalyzer -- an open-source, fully automatic deep learning method trained on 5,600 OCT B-scans from 385 eyes -- was developed to fully segment and quantify the choroid in EDI-OCT images, thus addressing these issues. Using the same dataset, we propose a Robust, Resolution-agnostic and Efficient Attention-based network for CHoroid segmentation (REACH). REACHNet leverages multi-resolution training with domain-specific data augmentation to promote generalisation, and uses a lightweight architecture with resolution-agnostic self-attention which is not only faster than Choroidalyzer's previous network (4 images/s vs. 2.75 images/s on a standard laptop CPU), but has greater performance for segmenting the choroid region, vessels and fovea (Dice coefficient for region 0.9769 vs. 0.9749, vessels 0.8612 vs. 0.8192 and fovea 0.8243 vs. 0.3783) due to its improved hyperparameter configuration and model training pipeline. REACHNet can be used with Choroidalyzer as a drop-in replacement for the original model and will be made available upon publication.</description>

      <title>HemSeg-200: A Voxel-Annotated Dataset for Intracerebral Hemorrhages Segmentation in Brain CT Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acute intracerebral hemorrhage is a life-threatening condition that demands immediate medical intervention. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) are critical subtypes of this condition. Clinically, when such hemorrhages are suspected, immediate CT scanning is essential to assess the extent of the bleeding and to facilitate the formulation of a targeted treatment plan. While current research in deep learning has largely focused on qualitative analyses, such as identifying subtypes of cerebral hemorrhages, there remains a significant gap in quantitative analysis crucial for enhancing clinical treatments. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces a dataset comprising 222 CT annotations, sourced from the RSNA 2019 Brain CT Hemorrhage Challenge and meticulously annotated at the voxel level for precise IPH and IVH segmentation. This dataset was utilized to train and evaluate seven advanced medical image segmentation algorithms, with the goal of refining the accuracy of segmentation for these hemorrhages. Our findings demonstrate that this dataset not only furthers the development of sophisticated segmentation algorithms but also substantially aids scientific research and clinical practice by improving the diagnosis and management of these severe hemorrhages.

      <title>MAMOC: MRI Motion Correction via Masked Autoencoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans poses a significant challenge, where even minor patient movements can lead to artifacts that may compromise the scan's utility. This paper introduces Masked Motion Correction (MAMOC), a novel method designed to address the issue of Retrospective Artifact Correction (RAC) in motion-affected MRI brain scans. MAMOC uses masked autoencoding self-supervision and test-time prediction to efficiently remove motion artifacts, producing state-of-the-art, native resolution scans. Until recently, realistic data to evaluate retrospective motion correction methods did not exist, motion artifacts had to be simulated. Leveraging the MR-ART dataset, this work is the first to evaluate motion correction in MRI scans using real motion data, showing the superiority of MAMOC to existing motion correction (MC) methods.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Network Model Observers Discount Signal-like Anatomical Structures During Search in Virtual Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model observers are computational tools to evaluate and optimize task-based medical image quality. Linear model observers, such as the Channelized Hotelling Observer (CHO), predict human accuracy in detection tasks with a few possible signal locations in clinical phantoms or real anatomic backgrounds. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed as a new type of model observer. What is not well understood is what CNNs add over the more common linear model observer approaches. We compare the CHO and CNN detection accuracy to the radiologist's accuracy in searching for two types of signals (mass and microcalcification) embedded in 2D/3D breast tomosynthesis phantoms (DBT). We show that the CHO model's accuracy is comparable to the CNN's performance for a location-known-exactly detection task. However, for the search task with 2D/3D DBT phantoms, the CHO's detection accuracy was significantly lower than the CNN accuracy. A comparison to the radiologist's accuracy showed that the CNN but not the CHO could match or exceed the radiologist's accuracy in the 2D microcalcification and 3D mass search conditions. An analysis of the eye position showed that radiologists fixated more often and longer at the locations corresponding to CNN false positives. Most CHO false positives were the phantom's normal anatomy and were not fixated by radiologists. In conclusion, we show that CNNs can be used as an anthropomorphic model observer for the search task for which traditional linear model observers fail due to their inability to discount false positives arising from the anatomical backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Score-based Diffusion Model for Limited-angle Reconstruction of Cardiac Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a major imaging modality for the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular diseases. High temporal resolution is essential to ensure diagnostic accuracy. Limited-angle data acquisition can reduce scan time and improve temporal resolution, but typically leads to severe image degradation and motivates for improved reconstruction techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed score-based diffusion model (PSDM) for limited-angle reconstruction of cardiac CT. At the sampling time, we combine a data prior from a diffusion model and a model prior obtained via an iterative algorithm and Fourier fusion to further enhance the image quality. Specifically, our approach integrates the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm with score-based diffusion models, thereby enabling us to reconstruct high-quality cardiac CT images from limited-angle data. The numerical simulations and real data experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Fast Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Medical Image-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved unprecedented success in computer vision. However, they remain underutilized in medical imaging, a field crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. This is primarily due to the high computational cost associated with (1) the use of large number of time steps (e.g., 1,000) in diffusion processes and (2) the increased dimensionality of medical images, which are often 3D or 4D. Training a diffusion model on medical images typically takes days to weeks, while sampling each image volume takes minutes to hours. To address this challenge, we introduce Fast-DDPM, a simple yet effective approach capable of improving training speed, sampling speed, and generation quality simultaneously. Unlike DDPM, which trains the image denoiser across 1,000 time steps, Fast-DDPM trains and samples using only 10 time steps. The key to our method lies in aligning the training and sampling procedures. We introduced two efficient noise schedulers with 10 time steps: one with uniform time step sampling and another with non-uniform sampling. We evaluated Fast-DDPM across three medical image-to-image generation tasks: multi-image super-resolution, image denoising, and image-to-image translation. Fast-DDPM outperformed DDPM and current state-of-the-art methods based on convolutional networks and generative adversarial networks in all tasks. Additionally, Fast-DDPM reduced training time by a factor of 5 and sampling time by a factor of 100 compared to DDPM. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/Fast-DDPM.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of Charge-Induced Signals in Photon-Counting CZT Detectors for Medical Imaging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-counting detectors based on CZT are essential in nuclear medical imaging, particularly for SPECT applications. Although CZT detectors are known for their precise energy resolution, defects within the CZT crystals significantly impact their performance. These defects result in inhomogeneous material properties throughout the bulk of the detector. The present work introduces an efficient computational model that simulates the operation of semiconductor detectors, accounting for the spatial variability of the crystal properties. Our simulator reproduces the charge-induced pulse signals generated after the X/gamma-rays interact with the detector. The performance evaluation of the model shows an RMSE in the signal below 0.70%. Our simulator can function as a digital twin to accurately replicate the operation of actual detectors. Thus, it can be used to mitigate and compensate for adverse effects arising from crystal impurities.</description>

      <title>Koopcon: A new approach towards smarter and less complex learning</title>

Abstract: In the era of big data, the sheer volume and complexity of datasets pose significant challenges in machine learning, particularly in image processing tasks. This paper introduces an innovative Autoencoder-based Dataset Condensation Model backed by Koopman operator theory that effectively packs large datasets into compact, information-rich representations. Inspired by the predictive coding mechanisms of the human brain, our model leverages a novel approach to encode and reconstruct data, maintaining essential features and label distributions. The condensation process utilizes an autoencoder neural network architecture, coupled with Optimal Transport theory and Wasserstein distance, to minimize the distributional discrepancies between the original and synthesized datasets. We present a two-stage implementation strategy: first, condensing the large dataset into a smaller synthesized subset; second, evaluating the synthesized data by training a classifier and comparing its performance with a classifier trained on an equivalent subset of the original data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the classifiers trained on condensed data exhibit comparable performance to those trained on the original datasets, thus affirming the efficacy of our condensation model. This work not only contributes to the reduction of computational resources but also paves the way for efficient data handling in constrained environments, marking a significant step forward in data-efficient machine learning.</description>

      <title>Eidos: Efficient, Imperceptible Adversarial 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification of 3D point clouds is a challenging machine learning (ML) task with important real-world applications in a spectrum from autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery to earth observation from low orbit. As with other ML tasks, classification models are notoriously brittle in the presence of adversarial attacks. These are rooted in imperceptible changes to inputs with the effect that a seemingly well-trained model ends up misclassifying the input. This paper adds to the understanding of adversarial attacks by presenting Eidos, a framework providing Efficient Imperceptible aDversarial attacks on 3D pOint cloudS. Eidos supports a diverse set of imperceptibility metrics. It employs an iterative, two-step procedure to identify optimal adversarial examples, thereby enabling a runtime-imperceptibility trade-off. We provide empirical evidence relative to several popular 3D point cloud classification models and several established 3D attack methods, showing Eidos' superiority with respect to efficiency as well as imperceptibility.</description>

      <title>RAQ-VAE: Rate-Adaptive Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) is an established technique in machine learning for learning discrete representations across various modalities. However, its scalability and applicability are limited by the need to retrain the model to adjust the codebook for different data or model scales. We introduce the Rate-Adaptive VQ-VAE (RAQ-VAE) framework, which addresses this challenge with two novel codebook representation methods: a model-based approach using a clustering-based technique on an existing well-trained VQ-VAE model, and a data-driven approach utilizing a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for variable-rate codebook generation. Our experiments demonstrate that RAQ-VAE achieves effective reconstruction performance across multiple rates, often outperforming conventional fixed-rate VQ-VAE models. This work enhances the adaptability and performance of VQ-VAEs, with broad applications in data reconstruction, generation, and computer vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for Gaussian distributions: Exact solutions and Wasserstein errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion or score-based models recently showed high performance in image generation. They rely on a forward and a backward stochastic differential equations (SDE). The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by solving numerically the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization and the score approximation. In this paper, we study theoretically the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this restricted framework where the score function is a linear operator, we can derive the analytical solutions of the forward and backward SDEs as well as the associated flow ODE. This provides exact expressions for various Wasserstein errors which enable us to compare the influence of each error type for any sampling scheme, thus allowing to monitor convergence directly in the data space instead of relying on Inception features. Our experiments show that the recommended numerical schemes from the diffusion models literature are also the best sampling schemes for Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <title>Exposure Diffusion: HDR Image Generation by Consistent LDR denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate generating high-dynamic range (HDR) images using the concerted action of multiple black-box, pre-trained low-dynamic range (LDR) image diffusion models. Common diffusion models are not HDR as, first, there is no sufficiently large HDR image dataset available to re-train them, and second, even if it was, re-training such models is impossible for most compute budgets. Instead, we seek inspiration from the HDR image capture literature that traditionally fuses sets of LDR images, called "brackets", to produce a single HDR image. We operate multiple denoising processes to generate multiple LDR brackets that together form a valid HDR result. To this end, we introduce an exposure consistency term into the diffusion process to couple the brackets such that they agree across the exposure range they share. We demonstrate HDR versions of state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional as well as restoration-type (LDR2HDR) generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Qubit-efficient Variational Quantum Algorithms for Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is expected to transform a range of computational tasks beyond the reach of classical algorithms. In this work, we examine the application of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) for unsupervised image segmentation to partition images into separate semantic regions. Specifically, we formulate the task as a graph cut optimization problem and employ two established qubit-efficient VQAs, which we refer to as Parametric Gate Encoding (PGE) and Ancilla Basis Encoding (ABE), to find the optimal segmentation mask. In addition, we propose Adaptive Cost Encoding (ACE), a new approach that leverages the same circuit architecture as ABE but adopts a problem-dependent cost function. We benchmark PGE, ABE and ACE on synthetically generated images, focusing on quality and trainability. ACE shows consistently faster convergence in training the parameterized quantum circuits in comparison to PGE and ABE. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the scalability of these approaches against the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), showing a significant cutback in the quantum resources, especially in the number of qubits that logarithmically depends on the number of pixels. The results validate the strengths of ACE, while concurrently highlighting its inherent limitations and challenges. This paves way for further research in quantum-enhanced computer vision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most learning-based image compression methods lack efficiency for high image quality due to their non-invertible design. The decoding function of the frequently applied compressive autoencoder architecture is only an approximated inverse of the encoding transform. This issue can be resolved by using invertible latent variable models, which allow a perfect reconstruction if no quantization is performed. Furthermore, many traditional image and video coders apply dynamic block partitioning to vary the compression of certain image regions depending on their content. Inspired by this approach, hierarchical latent spaces have been applied to learning-based compression networks. In this paper, we present a novel concept, which adapts the hierarchical latent space for augmented normalizing flows, an invertible latent variable model. Our best performing model achieved average rate savings of more than 7% over comparable single-scale models.</description>

      <title>K-band: Self-supervised MRI Reconstruction via Stochastic Gradient Descent over K-space Subsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although deep learning (DL) methods are powerful for solving inverse problems, their reliance on high-quality training data is a major hurdle. This is significant in high-dimensional (dynamic/volumetric) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where acquisition of high-resolution fully sampled k-space data is impractical. We introduce a novel mathematical framework, dubbed k-band, that enables training DL models using only partial, limited-resolution k-space data. Specifically, we introduce training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over k-space subsets. In each training iteration, rather than using the fully sampled k-space for computing gradients, we use only a small k-space portion. This concept is compatible with different sampling strategies; here we demonstrate the method for k-space "bands", which have limited resolution in one dimension and can hence be acquired rapidly. We prove analytically that our method stochastically approximates the gradients computed in a fully-supervised setup, when two simple conditions are met: (i) the limited-resolution axis is chosen randomly-uniformly for every new scan, hence k-space is fully covered across the entire training set, and (ii) the loss function is weighed with a mask, derived here analytically, which facilitates accurate reconstruction of high-resolution details. Numerical experiments with raw MRI data indicate that k-band outperforms two other methods trained on limited-resolution data and performs comparably to state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on high-resolution data. k-band hence obtains SoTA performance, with the advantage of training using only limited-resolution data. This work hence introduces a practical, easy-to-implement, self-supervised training framework, which involves fast acquisition and self-supervised reconstruction and offers theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Shape of my heart: Cardiac models through learned signed distance functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient construction of anatomical models is one of the major challenges of patient-specific in-silico models of the human heart. Current methods frequently rely on linear statistical models, allowing no advanced topological changes, or requiring medical image segmentation followed by a meshing pipeline, which strongly depends on image resolution, quality, and modality. These approaches are therefore limited in their transferability to other imaging domains. In this work, the cardiac shape is reconstructed by means of three-dimensional deep signed distance functions with Lipschitz regularity. For this purpose, the shapes of cardiac MRI reconstructions are learned to model the spatial relation of multiple chambers. We demonstrate that this approach is also capable of reconstructing anatomical models from partial data, such as point clouds from a single ventricle, or modalities different from the trained MRI, such as the electroanatomical mapping (EAM).</description>

      <title>Equivariant plug-and-play image reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plug-and-play algorithms constitute a popular framework for solving inverse imaging problems that rely on the implicit definition of an image prior via a denoiser. These algorithms can leverage powerful pre-trained denoisers to solve a wide range of imaging tasks, circumventing the necessity to train models on a per-task basis. Unfortunately, plug-and-play methods often show unstable behaviors, hampering their promise of versatility and leading to suboptimal quality of reconstructed images. In this work, we show that enforcing equivariance to certain groups of transformations (rotations, reflections, and/or translations) on the denoiser strongly improves the stability of the algorithm as well as its reconstruction quality. We provide a theoretical analysis that illustrates the role of equivariance on better performance and stability. We present a simple algorithm that enforces equivariance on any existing denoiser by simply applying a random transformation to the input of the denoiser and the inverse transformation to the output at each iteration of the algorithm. Experiments on multiple imaging modalities and denoising networks show that the equivariant plug-and-play algorithm improves both the reconstruction performance and the stability compared to their non-equivariant counterparts.</description>

      <title>An $\ell^1$-Plug-and-Play Approach for MPI Using a Zero Shot Denoiser with Evaluation on the 3D Open MPI Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging medical imaging modality which has gained increasing interest in recent years. Among the benefits of MPI are its high temporal resolution, and that the technique does not expose the specimen to any kind of ionizing radiation. It is based on the non-linear response of magnetic nanoparticles to an applied magnetic field. From the electric signal measured in receive coils, the particle concentration has to be reconstructed. Due to the ill-posedness of the reconstruction problem, various regularization methods have been proposed for reconstruction ranging from early stopping methods, via classical Tikhonov regularization and iterative methods to modern machine learning approaches. In this work, we contribute to the latter class: we propose a plug-and-play approach based on a generic zero-shot denoiser with an $\ell^1$-prior.
  Approach: We validate the reconstruction parameters of the method on a hybrid dataset and compare it with the baseline Tikhonov, DIP and the previous PP-MPI, which is a plug-and-play method with denoiser trained on MPI-friendly data.
  Main results: We offer a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the zero-shot plug-and-play approach on the 3D Open MPI dataset. Moreover, we show the quality of the approach with different levels of preprocessing of the data.
  Significance: The proposed method employs a zero-shot denoiser which has not been trained for the MPI task and therefore saves the cost for training. Moreover, it offers a method that can be potentially applied in future MPI contexts.</description>

      <title>Low-Dose CT Reconstruction Using Dataset-free Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Dose computer tomography (LDCT) is an ideal alternative to reduce radiation risk in clinical applications. Although supervised-deep-learning-based reconstruction methods have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional model-driven reconstruction algorithms, they require collecting massive pairs of low-dose and norm-dose CT images for neural network training, which limits their practical application in LDCT imaging. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised and training data-free learning reconstruction method for LDCT imaging that avoids the requirement for training data. The proposed method is a post-processing technique that aims to enhance the initial low-quality reconstruction results, and it reconstructs the high-quality images by neural work training that minimizes the $\ell_1$-norm distance between the CT measurements and their corresponding simulated sinogram data, as well as the total variation (TV) value of the reconstructed image. Moreover, the proposed method does not require to set the weights for both the data fidelity term and the plenty term. Experimental results on the AAPM challenge data and LoDoPab-CT data demonstrate that the proposed method is able to effectively suppress the noise and preserve the tiny structures. Also, these results demonstrate the rapid convergence and low computational cost of the proposed method. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/linfengyu77/IRLDCT}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has great potential to improve health outcomes by training systems on vast digitized clinical datasets. Computational Pathology, with its massive amounts of microscopy image data and impact on diagnostics and biomarkers, is at the forefront of this development. Gigapixel pathology slides pose a unique challenge due to their enormous size and are usually divided into tens of thousands of smaller tiles for analysis. This results in a discontinuity in the machine learning process by separating the training of tile-level encoders from slide-level aggregators and the need to adopt weakly supervised learning strategies. Training models from entire pathology slides end-to-end has been largely unexplored due to its computational challenges. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach to jointly train both a tile encoder and a slide-aggregator fully in memory and end-to-end at high-resolution, bridging the gap between input and slide-level supervision. While more computationally expensive, detailed quantitative validation shows promise for large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning of pathology foundation models.</description>

      <title>Equipping Computational Pathology Systems with Artifact Processing Pipelines: A Showcase for Computation and Performance Trade-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Histopathology is a gold standard for cancer diagnosis under a microscopic examination. However, histological tissue processing procedures result in artifacts, which are ultimately transferred to the digitized version of glass slides, known as whole slide images (WSIs). Artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant areas and may result in wrong deep learning (DL) algorithms predictions. Therefore, detecting and excluding artifacts in the computational pathology (CPATH) system is essential for reliable automated diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE) scheme for detecting five notable artifacts, including damaged tissue, blur, folded tissue, air bubbles, and histologically irrelevant blood from WSIs. First, we train independent binary DL models as experts to capture particular artifact morphology. Then, we ensemble their predictions using a fusion mechanism. We apply probabilistic thresholding over the final probability distribution to improve the sensitivity of the MoE. We developed DL pipelines using two MoEs and two multiclass models of state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). DCNNs-based MoE and ViTs-based MoE schemes outperformed simpler multiclass models and were tested on datasets from different hospitals and cancer types, where MoE using DCNNs yielded the best results. The proposed MoE yields 86.15% F1 and 97.93% sensitivity scores on unseen data, retaining less computational cost for inference than MoE using ViTs. This best performance of MoEs comes with relatively higher computational trade-offs than multiclass models. The proposed artifact detection pipeline will not only ensure reliable CPATH predictions but may also provide quality control.</description>

Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) has achieved dramatic progress regarding objective and subjective metrics. MSE-based models aim to improve objective metrics while generative models are leveraged to improve visual quality measured by subjective metrics. However, they all suffer from blurring or deformation at low bit rates, especially at below $0.2bpp$. Besides, deformation on human faces and text is unacceptable for visual quality assessment, and the problem becomes more prominent on small faces and text. To solve this problem, we combine the advantage of MSE-based models and generative models by utilizing region of interest (ROI). We propose Hierarchical-ROI (H-ROI), to split images into several foreground regions and one background region to improve the reconstruction of regions containing faces, text, and complex textures. Further, we propose adaptive quantization by non-linear mapping within the channel dimension to constrain the bit rate while maintaining the visual quality. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve better visual quality on small faces and text with lower bit rates, e.g., $0.7X$ bits of HiFiC and $0.5X$ bits of BPG.</description>

      <title>SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising</title>

Abstract: Denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure for hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these kinds of domain knowledge separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more in-depth long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. The SSUMamba can exploit complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Zigzag Scan (SSAZS) strategy for HSIs, which helps exploit the continuous information flow in multiple directions of 3-D characteristics within HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparison methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</description>

      <title>PRISM: A Multi-Modal Generative Foundation Model for Slide-Level Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models in computational pathology promise to unlock the development of new clinical decision support systems and models for precision medicine. However, there is a mismatch between most clinical analysis, which is defined at the level of one or more whole slide images, and foundation models to date, which process the thousands of image tiles contained in a whole slide image separately. The requirement to train a network to aggregate information across a large number of tiles in multiple whole slide images limits these models' impact. In this work, we present a slide-level foundation model for H&amp;E-stained histopathology, PRISM, that builds on Virchow tile embeddings and leverages clinical report text for pre-training. Using the tile embeddings, PRISM produces slide-level embeddings with the ability to generate clinical reports, resulting in several modes of use. Using text prompts, PRISM achieves zero-shot cancer detection and sub-typing performance approaching and surpassing that of a supervised aggregator model. Using the slide embeddings with linear classifiers, PRISM surpasses supervised aggregator models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning of the PRISM slide encoder yields label-efficient training for biomarker prediction, a task that typically suffers from low availability of training data; an aggregator initialized with PRISM and trained on as little as 10% of the training data can outperform a supervised baseline that uses all of the data.</description>

      <title>Mammo-CLIP: A Vision Language Foundation Model to Enhance Data Efficiency and Robustness in Mammography</title>

Abstract: The lack of large and diverse training data on Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) in breast cancer detection has been one of the concerns that impedes the adoption of the system. Recently, pre-training with large-scale image text datasets via Vision-Language models (VLM) (\eg CLIP) partially addresses the issue of robustness and data efficiency in computer vision (CV). This paper proposes Mammo-CLIP, the first VLM pre-trained on a substantial amount of screening mammogram-report pairs, addressing the challenges of dataset diversity and size. Our experiments on two public datasets demonstrate strong performance in classifying and localizing various mammographic attributes crucial for breast cancer detection, showcasing data efficiency and robustness similar to CLIP in CV. We also propose Mammo-FActOR, a novel feature attribution method, to provide spatial interpretation of representation with sentence-level granularity within mammography reports. Code is available publicly: \url{https://github.com/batmanlab/Mammo-CLIP}.</description>

      <title>Detecting Out-of-Distribution Through the Lens of Neural Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and versatile Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the safe deployment of AI yet remains challenging for existing algorithms. Inspired by Neural Collapse, we discover that features of in-distribution (ID) samples cluster closer to the weight vectors compared to features of OOD samples. In addition, we reveal that ID features tend to expand in space to structure a simplex Equiangular Tight Framework, which nicely explains the prevalent observation that ID features reside further from the origin than OOD features. Taking both insights from Neural Collapse into consideration, we propose to leverage feature proximity to weight vectors for OOD detection and further complement this perspective by using feature norms to filter OOD samples. Extensive experiments on off-the-shelf models demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method across diverse classification tasks and model architectures, enhancing the generalization capability of OOD detection.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Real-time Cine and Flow under In-magnet Staged Exercise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a wellestablished imaging tool for diagnosing and managing cardiac conditions. The integration of exercise stress with CMR (ExCMR) can enhance its diagnostic capacity. Despite recent advances in CMR technology, quantitative ExCMR during exercise remains technically challenging due to motion artifacts and limited spatial and temporal resolution. Methods: This study investigated the feasibility of biventricular functional and hemodynamic assessment using real-time (RT) ExCMR during a staged exercise protocol in 24 healthy volunteers. We applied a coil reweighting technique and employed high acceleration rates to minimize motion blurring and artifacts. We further applied a beat-selection technique that identified beats from the endexpiratory phase to minimize the impact of respiration-induced through-plane motion. Additionally, results from six patients were presented to demonstrate clinical feasibility. Results: Our findings indicated a consistent decrease in end-systolic volume and stable end-diastolic volume across exercise intensities, leading to increased stroke volume and ejection fraction. The selection of end-expiratory beats enhanced the repeatability of cardiac function parameters, as shown by scan-rescan tests in nine volunteers. High scores from a blinded image quality assessment indicated that coil reweighting effectively minimized motion artifacts. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of RT ExCMR with inmagnet exercise in healthy subjects and patients. Our results indicate that high acceleration rates, coil reweighting, and selection of respiratory phase-specific heartbeats enhance image quality and repeatability of quantitative RT ExCMR.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, there has been a growing trend in the fields of high-energy physics (HEP) in its both parts experimental and phenomenological studies, to incorporate machine learning (ML) and its specialized branch, deep learning (DL). This review paper provides a thorough illustration of these applications using different DL approaches. The first part of the paper examines the basics of various particle physics types and sets up guidelines for assessing particle physics alongside the available learning models. Next, a detailed classification is provided for representing the jet images that are reconstructed in high energy collisions mainly with proton-proton collisions at well defined beam energies, covering various datasets, preprocessing techniques, and feature extraction and selection methods. The presented techniques can be applied to future hadron-hadron colliders (HLC) such as high luminosity LHC (HL-HLC) and future circular collider-hadron-hadron (FCC-hh). Next, the authors explore a number of AI models analysis designed specifically for images in HEP. We additionally undertake a closer look at the classification associated with images in hadron collisions, with an emphasis on Jets. In this review, we look into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in ML and DL, examining their implications for HEP demands. More precisely, this discussion tackles various applications in extensive detail, such as Jet tagging, Jet tracking, particle classification, and more. The review concludes with an analysis of the current state of HEP, using DL methodologies. It covers the challenges and potential areas for future research that will be illustrated for each application.</description>

      <title>Insight Into the Collocation of Multi-Source Satellite Imagery for Multi-Scale Vessel Detection</title>

Abstract: Ship detection from satellite imagery using Deep Learning (DL) is an indispensable solution for maritime surveillance. However, applying DL models trained on one dataset to others having differences in spatial resolution and radiometric features requires many adjustments. To overcome this issue, this paper focused on the DL models trained on datasets that consist of different optical images and a combination of radar and optical data. When dealing with a limited number of training images, the performance of DL models via this approach was satisfactory. They could improve 5-20% of average precision, depending on the optical images tested. Likewise, DL models trained on the combined optical and radar dataset could be applied to both optical and radar images. Our experiments showed that the models trained on an optical dataset could be used for radar images, while those trained on a radar dataset offered very poor scores when applied to optical images.</description>

      <title>AddSR: Accelerating Diffusion-based Blind Super-Resolution with Adversarial Diffusion Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind super-resolution methods based on stable diffusion showcase formidable generative capabilities in reconstructing clear high-resolution images with intricate details from low-resolution inputs. However, their practical applicability is often hampered by poor efficiency, stemming from the requirement of thousands or hundreds of sampling steps. Inspired by the efficient adversarial diffusion distillation (ADD), we design~\name~to address this issue by incorporating the ideas of both distillation and ControlNet. Specifically, we first propose a prediction-based self-refinement strategy to provide high-frequency information in the student model output with marginal additional time cost. Furthermore, we refine the training process by employing HR images, rather than LR images, to regulate the teacher model, providing a more robust constraint for distillation. Second, we introduce a timestep-adaptive ADD to address the perception-distortion imbalance problem introduced by original ADD. Extensive experiments demonstrate our~\name~generates better restoration results, while achieving faster speed than previous SD-based state-of-the-art models (e.g., $7$$\times$ faster than SeeSR).</description>

      <title>AD-Aligning: Emulating Human-like Generalization for Cognitive Domain Adaptation in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain adaptation is pivotal for enabling deep learning models to generalize across diverse domains, a task complicated by variations in presentation and cognitive nuances. In this paper, we introduce AD-Aligning, a novel approach that combines adversarial training with source-target domain alignment to enhance generalization capabilities. By pretraining with Coral loss and standard loss, AD-Aligning aligns target domain statistics with those of the pretrained encoder, preserving robustness while accommodating domain shifts. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and domain shift scenarios, including noise-induced shifts and cognitive domain adaptation tasks, we demonstrate AD-Aligning's superior performance compared to existing methods such as Deep Coral and ADDA. Our findings highlight AD-Aligning's ability to emulate the nuanced cognitive processes inherent in human perception, making it a promising solution for real-world applications requiring adaptable and robust domain adaptation strategies.</description>
