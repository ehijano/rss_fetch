      <title>Formal languages, spin systems, and quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a categorical formalism for context-free languages with morphisms given by correspondences obtained from rational transductions. We show that D0L-systems are a special case of the correspondences that define morphisms in this category. We construct a functorial mapping to aperiodic spin chains. We then generalize this construction to a class of mildly context sensitive grammars, the multiple-context-free grammars (MCFG), with a similar functorial mapping to spin systems in higher dimensions, with Boltzmann weights describing interacting spins on vertices of hypercubes. We show that a particular motivating example for this general construction is provided by the Korepin completely integrable model on the icosahedral quasicrystal, which we construct as the spin system associated to a multiple-context-free grammar describing the geometry of the Ammann planes quasilattice. We review the main properties of this spin system, including solvability, bulk free energy, and criticality, based on results of Baxter and the known relation to the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation. We show that the latter has a generalization for the Boltzmannweights on hypercubes of the spin systems associated to more general MCFGs in terms of two dual cubulations of the n-simplex. We formulate analogous questions about bulk free energy and criticality for our construction of spin systems.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian Approach in Sturm-Liouville Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method for finding the eigenvalues of a Sturm-Liouville problem is developed. Following the minimalist approach the problem is transformed to a single first-order differential equation with appropriate boundary conditions. Although the resulting equation is nonlinear, its form allows to find the general solution by adding a second part to a particular solution. This splitting of the general solution in two parts involves the Schwarzian derivative, hence the name of the approach. The eigenvalues that correspond to acceptable solutions asymptotically can be found by requiring the second part to correct the diverging behavior of the particular solution. The method can be applied to many different areas of physics, such as the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics and stability problems in fluid dynamics. Examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical motion of charged particles interacting with scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to investigate the dynamics of semi-relativistic or non-relativistic charged particles in interaction with a scalar meson field. Our main contribution is the derivation of the classical dynamics of a particle-field system as an effective equation of the quantum microscopic Nelson model, in the classical limit where the value of the Planck constant approaches zero ($\hbar\to 0$). Thus, we prove the validity of Bohr's correspondence principle, that is to establish the transition from quantum to classical dynamics. We use a Wigner measure approach to study such transition. Then, as a consequence of this interplay between classical and quantum dynamics, we establish the global well-posedness of the classical particle-field interacting system, despite the low regularity of the related vector field, which prevents the use of a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Sachs equations and plane waves II: Isometries and conformal isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes the symmetries of plane wave spacetimes in dimension four and greater. It begins with a description of the isometric automorphisms, and in particular the homogeneous plane waves. Then the article turns to describing isometries from one plane wave to another. The structure of the isometries is relevant for the problem of classifying vacuum spacetimes by observables, and the article presents an explicit example of a family of vacuum spacetimes encoding the Bernoulli shift, and so not classifiable by observables. Next, the article turns to a description of the conformal isometries. Here it is assumed that the conformal curvature does not vanish identically, the case of Minkowski space being both trivial and very degenerate. The article then classifies all conformal automorphisms and isometries of plane waves of the Rosen and Brinkmann forms.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian multiform for cyclotomic Gaudin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian multiform for the class of cyclotomic (rational) Gaudin models by formulating its hierarchy within the Lie dialgebra framework of Semenov-Tian-Shansky and by using the framework of Lagrangian multiforms on coadjoint orbits. This provides the first example of a Lagrangian multiform for an integrable hierarchy whose classical $r$-matrix is non-skew-symmetric and spectral parameter-dependent. As an important by-product of the construction, we obtain a Lagrangian multiform for the periodic Toda chain by choosing an appropriate realisation of the cyclotomic Gaudin Lax matrix. This fills a gap in the landscape of Toda models as only the open and infinite chains had been previously cast into the Lagrangian multiform framework. A slightly different choice of realisation produces the so-called DST model. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework by coupling the periodic Toda chain with the DST model and by obtaining a Lagrangian multiform for the corresponding integrable hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg dynamics of mixed quantum-classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of interacting quantum and classical systems in the Heisenberg representation. Unlike the usual construction in standard quantum mechanics, mixed quantum-classical systems involve the interplay of unitary operators acting on the quantum observables and the Lagrangian trajectories sweeping the classical degrees of freedom. This interplay reflects an intricate structure which is made particularly challenging by the backreaction excerpted on the classical trajectories by the quantum degrees of freedom. While the backreaction is underestimated in the common Ehrenfest model, more recent methodologies succeed in capturing this important effect by resorting to Koopman wavefunctions in classical mechanics. Luckily, both Ehrenfest and Koopman models enjoy a variational framework which is exploited here to unfold the geometric structure underlying quantum-classical coupling. A special role is played by the action of the diffeomorphic Lagrangian paths on a non-Abelian pure-gauge potential which comprises statistical correlations. After presenting the treatment in the simple case of Ehrenfest dynamics, we move on to the Koopman model and present the role of the backreaction terms therein. Finally, we compare both models in the context of pure-dephasing systems.</description>

      <title>Conformal deformations of initial data sets to the strict dominant energy condition using a spacetime Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an alternate proof of one of the results given in [16] showing that initial data sets with boundary for the Einstein equations $(M, g, k)$ satisfying the dominant energy condition can be conformally deformed to the strict dominant energy condition, while preserving the character of the boundary (minimal, future trapped, or past trapped) while changing the area of the boundary and ADM energy of the initial data set by an arbitrarily small amount. The proof relies on solving an equation that looks like the equation for spacetime harmonic functions studied in [7], but with a Neumann boundary condition and non-zero right hand side, which we refer to as a spacetime Poisson equation. One advantage of this method of proof is that the conformal deformation is explicitly constructed as a solution to a PDE, as opposed to only knowing the solution exists via an application of the implicit function theorem as in [16]. We restrict ourselves to the physically relevant case of a $3$-manifold $M$, though the proof can be generalized to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate localization in a many-body quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of extensive many-body Hamiltonians with few-body interactions and a many-body mobility edge: all eigenstates below a nonzero energy density are localized in an exponentially small fraction of "energetically allowed configurations" within Hilbert space. Our construction is based on quantum perturbations to a classical low-density parity check code. In principle, it is possible to detect this eigenstate localization by measuring few-body correlation functions in efficiently preparable mixed states.</description>

      <title>Hushing black holes: tails in dynamical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary, asymptotically flat, black hole solutions of the vacuum field equations of General Relativity belong to the Kerr family. But how does one approach this state, dynamically? Linearized fluctuations decay at late times, at fixed spatial position, as a Price power law for generic initial conditions. However, little attention was paid to forced and nonlinear spacetimes, where matter and nonlinearities play a role. We uncover a new, source-driven tail governing waves generated by pointlike matter and nonlinearities, which can dominate over Price's decay.</description>

      <title>Trace Moments for Schr\"odinger Operators with Matrix White Noise and the Rigidity of the Multivariate Stochastic Airy Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semigroups of random Schr\"odinger operators of the form $\widehat{H}f=-\frac12f''+(V+\xi)f$, where $f:I\to\mathbb F^r$ ($\mathbb F=\mathbb R,\mathbb C,\mathbb H$) are vector-valued functions on a possibly infinite interval $I\subset\mathbb R$ that satisfy a mix of Robin and Dirichlet boundary conditions, $V$ is a deterministic diagonal potential with power-law growth at infinity, and $\xi$ is a matrix white noise. Our main result consists of Feynman-Kac formulas for trace moments of the form $\mathbf E[\prod_{k=1}^n\mathrm{Tr}[\mathrm e^{-t_k\widehat{H}}]]$ ($n\in\mathbb N$, $t_k&gt;0$).
  One notable example covered by our main result consists of the multivariate stochastic Airy operator (SAO) of Bloemendal and Vir\'ag (Ann. Probab., 44(4):2726-2769, 2016), which characterizes the soft-edge eigenvalue fluctuations of critical rank-$r$ spiked Wishart and GO/U/SE random matrices. As a corollary of our main result, we prove that if $V$'s growth is at least linear (this includes the multivariate SAO), then $\widehat{H}$'s spectrum is number rigid in the sense of Ghosh and Peres (Duke Math. J., 166(10):1789-1858, 2017). Together with the rigidity of the scalar SAO, this completes the characterization of number rigidity in the soft-edge limits of Gaussian $\beta$-ensembles and their finite-rank spiked versions.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed information flow through a wormhole in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Letter aims to advance novel properties of a class of Closed Timelike Curves recently discovered in scalar-tensor gravity [Universe 9, 467 (2023)]. Therein, it was shown that a wormhole acts a gateway between two $\textit{time-mirrored}$ worlds, where the two asymptotically flat sheets in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram are glued antipodally along $\textit{three}$ directions -- time $t$ and the polar and azimuth angles $(\theta,\,\varphi)$ of the 2-sphere -- to form a wormhole throat. This contrasts with the standard embedding diagram which typically glues the sheets only along the $\theta$ and $\varphi$ directions. Crucially, due to the `gluing' along the $t$ direction, the wormhole becomes a portal connecting the two spacetime sheets with $\textit{opposite}$ physical time flows, enabling the emergence of closed timelike loops which straddle the throat. We shall point out that this portal $\textit{mathematically}$ permits the possibility of backward propagation of information $\textit{against}$ time. This feature is ubiquitous for wormholes in scalar-tensor theories. In addition, we formulate the Feynman sum for transition amplitudes of microscopic particles in the proximity of a wormhole throat in which we account for timelike paths that experience time reversal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a functional analytic framework for making computer assisted arguments involving transverse heteroclinic connecting orbits between hyperbolic periodic solutions of ordinary differential equations. We exploit a Fourier-Taylor approximation of the local stable/unstable manifold of the periodic orbit, combined with a numerical method for solving two point boundary value problems via Chebyshev series approximations. The a-posteriori analysis developed provides mathematically rigorous bounds on all approximation errors, providing both abstract existence results and quantitative information about the true heteroclinic solution. Example calculations are given for both the dissipative Lorenz system and the Hamiltonian Hill Restricted Four Body Problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some of the properties of the $G \to 0$ limit of the Kerr-Newman solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations. Noting Carter's observation of the near equality between the $g = 2$ gyromagnetic ratio in the Kerr-Newman solution and that of the electron, we discuss additional such coincidences relating to the Kerr-Newman multipoles and properties of the electron. In contrast to the Coulomb field, this spinning Maxwell field has a finite Lagrangian. Moreover, by evaluating the Lagrangian for the superposition of two such Kerr-Newman electromagnetic fields on a flat background, we are able to find their interaction potential. This yields a correction to the Coulomb interaction due to the spin of the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a bi-flat F-structure $(\nabla,\circ,e,\nabla^*,*,E)$ on a manifold $M$ defines a differential bicomplex $(d_{\nabla},d_{E\circ\nabla^*})$ on forms with value on the tangent sheaf of the manifold. Moreover, the sequence of vector fields defined recursively by $d_{\nabla}X_{(\alpha+1)}=d_{L\nabla^*}X_{(\alpha)}$ coincide with the coefficients of the formal expansion of the flat local sections of a family of flat connections $\nabla^{GM}$ associated with the bi-flat structure. In the case of Dubrovin-Frobenius manifold the connection $\nabla^{GM}$ (for suitable choice of an auxiliary parameter) can be identified with the Levi-Civita connection of the flat pencil of metrics defined by the invariant metric and the intesection form.</description>

      <title>Learning tensor trains from noisy functions with application to quantum simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor cross interpolation (TCI) is a powerful technique for learning a tensor train (TT) by adaptively sampling a target tensor based on an interpolation formula. However, when the tensor evaluations contain random noise, optimizing the TT is more advantageous than interpolating the noise. Here, we propose a new method that starts with an initial guess of TT and optimizes it using non-linear least-squares by fitting it to measured points obtained from TCI. We use quantics TCI (QTCI) in this method and demonstrate its effectiveness on sine and two-time correlation functions, with each evaluated with random noise. The resulting TT exhibits increased robustness against noise compared to the QTCI method. Furthermore, we employ this optimized TT of the correlation function in quantum simulation based on pseudo-imaginary-time evolution, resulting in ground-state energy with higher accuracy than the QTCI or Monte Carlo methods.</description>

Abstract: We consider two compact metric spaces $J$ and $X$ and a uniform contractible iterated function system $\{\phi_j: X \to X \, | \, j \in J \}$. For a Lipschitz continuous function $A$ on $J \times X$ and for each $\beta&gt;0$ we consider the Gibbs probability $\rho_{_{\beta A}}$. Our goal is to study a large deviation principle for such family of probabilities as $\beta \to +\infty$ and its connections with idempotent probabilities. In the non-place dependent case ($A(j,x)=A_j,\,\forall x\in X$) we will prove that $(\rho_{_{\beta A}})$ satisfy a LDP and $-I$ (where $I$ is the deviation function) is the density of the unique invariant idempotent probability for a mpIFS associated to $A$. In the place dependent case, we prove that, if $(\rho_{_{\beta A}})$ satisfy a LDP, then $-I$ is the density of an invariant idempotent probability. Such idempotent probabilities were recently characterized through the Ma\~{n}\'{e} potential and Aubry set, therefore we will obtain an identical characterization for $-I$.</description>

      <title>Explicit gate construction of block-encoding for Hamiltonians needed for simulating partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation is an emerging technology with important potential for solving certain problems pivotal in various scientific and engineering disciplines. This paper introduces an efficient quantum protocol for the explicit construction of the block-encoding for an important class of Hamiltonians. Using the Schrodingerisation technique -- which converts non-conservative PDEs into conservative ones -- this particular class of Hamiltonians is shown to be sufficient for simulating any linear partial differential equations that have coefficients which are polynomial functions. The class of Hamiltonians consist of discretisations of polynomial products and sums of position and momentum operators. This construction is explicit and leverages minimal one- and two-qubit operations. The explicit construction of this block-encoding forms a fundamental building block for constructing the unitary evolution operator for this Hamiltonian. The proposed algorithm exhibits polynomial scaling with respect to the spatial partitioning size, suggesting an exponential speedup over classical finite-difference methods. This work provides an important foundation for building explicit and efficient quantum circuits for solving partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sandwich gravitational waves exhibit the velocity memory effect (VM) which however can become, for specific values of the wave parameters, pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. Fixing such a "miraculous" value, the particle trajectory is an (approximate) standing wave characterized by a unique integer $m$, for which the particle does not absorb any energy from the passing wave. Our statements are illustrated by a simple Gaussian and by the P\"oschl-Teller potential as profiles.</description>

Abstract: We show the non-compactness of moduli space of solutions of the monopole equations for $3/2$-spinors on a closed 3-manifold is equivalent to the existence of `3/2-Fueter sections' that are solutions of an overdetermined non-linear elliptic differential equation. These are sections of a fiber bundle whose fiber is a special 4-dimensional submanifold of the hyperk\"ahler manifold of center-framed charged one $SU(2)$-instantons on $\mathbf{R}^4$. This fiber bundle does not inherit a hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Balian-Brezin decomposition for exponentials with linear fermionic part</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermionic Gaussian states have garnered considerable attention due to their intriguing properties, most notably Wick's theorem. Expanding upon the work of Balian and Brezin, who generalized properties of fermionic Gaussian operators and states, we further extend their findings to incorporate Gaussian operators with a linear component. Leveraging a technique introduced by Colpa, we streamline the analysis and present a comprehensive extension of the Balian-Brezin decomposition (BBD) to encompass exponentials involving linear terms. Furthermore, we introduce Gaussian states featuring a linear part and derive corresponding overlap formulas. Additionally, we generalize Wick's theorem to encompass scenarios involving linear terms, facilitating the expression of generic expectation values in relation to one and two-point correlation functions. We also provide a brief commentary on the applicability of the BB decomposition in addressing the BCH (Zassenhaus) formulas within the $\mathfrak{so}(N)$ Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Discrete orthogonality relations for multi-indexed Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.08950v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete orthogonality relations hold for all the orthogonal polynomials obeying three term recurrence relations. We show that they also hold for multi-indexed Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials, which are new orthogonal polynomials obtained by deforming these classical orthogonal polynomials. The discrete orthogonality relations could be considered as more encompassing characterisation of orthogonal polynomials than the three term recurrence relations. As the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials start at a positive degree $\ell_{\mathcal D}\ge1$, the three term recurrence relations are broken. The extra $\ell_{\mathcal D}$ `lower degree polynomials', which are necessary for the discrete orthogonality relations, are identified. The corresponding Christoffel numbers are determined. The main results are obtained by the blow-up analysis of the second order differential operators governing the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials around the zeros of these polynomials at a degree $\ell_{\mathcal D}+\mathcal{N}$. %changed The discrete orthogonality relations are shown to hold for another group of `new' orthogonal polynomials called Krein-Adler polynomials based on the Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials.</description>

      <title>Operational Interpretation of the Sandwiched R\'enyi Divergence of Order 1/2 to 1 as Strong Converse Exponents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00554v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, as well as its induced quantum information quantities, with an operational interpretation in the characterization of the exact strong converse exponents of quantum tasks. Specifically, we consider (a) smoothing of the max-relative entropy, (b) quantum privacy amplification, and (c) quantum information decoupling. We solve the problem of determining the exact strong converse exponents for these three tasks, with the performance being measured by the fidelity or purified distance. The results are given in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, and its induced quantum R\'enyi conditional entropy and quantum R\'enyi mutual information. This is the first time to find the precise operational meaning for the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence with R\'enyi parameter in the interval $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of return times and related entropy estimators on shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the large deviation principle for several entropy and cross entropy estimators based on return times and waiting times on shift spaces over finite alphabets. We consider shift-invariant probability measures satisfying some decoupling conditions which imply no form of mixing nor ergodicity. We establish precise relations between the rate functions of the different estimators, and between these rate functions and the corresponding pressures, one of which is the R\'enyi entropy function. For the most commonly used definition of return times, the large-deviation rate function is proved to be nonconvex, except in marginal cases. The results apply in particular to irreducible Markov chains, equilibrium measures for Bowen-regular potentials, g-measures, invariant Gibbs states for absolutely summable interactions in statistical mechanics, and also to probability measures which may be far from Gibbsian, including some hidden Markov models and repeated quantum measurement processes.</description>

      <title>Intertwining the Busemann process of the directed polymer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Busemann process of the planar directed polymer model with i.i.d. weights on the vertices of the planar square lattice, both the general case and the solvable inverse-gamma case. We demonstrate that the Busemann process intertwines with an evolution obeying a version of the geometric Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence. In the inverse-gamma case this relationship enables an explicit description of the distribution of the Busemann process: the Busemann function on a nearest-neighbor edge has independent increments in the direction variable, and its distribution comes from an inhomogeneous planar Poisson process. Various corollaries follow, including that each Busemann function has the same countably infinite dense set of discontinuities in the direction variable. This contrasts with the known zero-temperature last-passage percolation cases, where the analogous sets are nowhere dense but have a dense union. The distribution of the asymptotic competition interface direction of the inverse-gamma polymer is discrete and supported on the Busemann discontinuities. Further implications follow for the eternal solutions and the failure of the one force--one solution principle for the discrete stochastic heat equation solved by the polymer partition function.</description>

      <title>The Spin Point Groups and their Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin point groups are finite groups whose elements act on both real space and spin space. Among these groups are the magnetic point groups in the case where the real and spin space operations are locked to one another. The magnetic point groups are central to magnetic crystallography for strong spin-orbit coupled systems and the spin point groups generalize these to the intermediate and weak spin-orbit coupled cases. The spin point groups were introduced in the 1960's and enumerated shortly thereafter. In this paper, we complete the theory of spin point groups by presenting an account of these groups and their representation theory. Our main findings are that the so-called nontrivial spin point groups (numbering 598 groups) have co-irreps corresponding exactly to the (co-)irreps of regular or black and white groups and we tabulate this correspondence for each nontrivial group. However a total spin group, comprising the product of a nontrivial group and a spin-only group, has new co-irreps in cases where there is continuous rotational freedom. We provide explicit co-irrep tables for all these instances. We also discuss new forms of spin-only group extending the Litvin-Opechowski classes. To exhibit the usefulness of these groups to physically relevant problems we discuss a number of examples from electronic band structures of altermagnets to magnons.</description>

      <title>A unified description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity of the metric-affine geometry with the M\"{o}bius representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical fundamentals for a unified description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity 2-forms in the way extending the so-called M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group, which is the method to convert the semi-direct product into the ordinary matrix product, to revive the fertility of gauge theories of gravity. First of all, we illustrate the basic concepts for constructing the metric-affine geometry. Then the curvature and torsion 2-forms are described in a unified manner by using the Cartan connection of the M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group. In this unified-description, the curvature and torsion are derived by Cartan's structure equation with respect to a common connection 1-form. After that, extending the M\"{o}bius representation, the dilation and shear 2-forms, or equivalently, the non-metricity 2-form, are introduced in the same unified manner. Based on the unified-description established in this paper, introducing a new group parametrization and applying the In\"{o}n\"{u}-Wigner group contraction to the full theory, the relationships among symmetries, geometric quantities, and geometries are investigated with respect to the three gauge groups: the metric-affine group and its extension, and an extension of the (anti)-de Sitter group in which the non-metricity exists. Finally, possible applications to theories of gravity are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a concept of the operator (non-commutative) projective line PH defined by a Hilbert space H and a symplectic structure on it. Points of PH are Lagrangian subspaces of H. If a particular Lagrangian subspace is fixed then we can define SL(2,R)-action on PH. This gives a consistent framework for linear fractional transformations of operators. Some connections with spectral theory are outline as well.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501, non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the principles of the ETH - Approach to Quantum Mechanics we study fluorescence and the phenomenon of ``quantum jumps'' in idealized models of atoms coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field. In a limiting regime where the orbital motion of the atoms is neglected and the velocity of light tends to infinity we derive explicit non-linear stochastic differential equations describing the effective time evolution of states of individual atoms. These equations give rise to a measure on state-trajectories with quantum jumps which is a quantum-mechanical analogue of the Wiener measure of Brownian motion. Our results amount to a derivation of the fundamental randomness in the quantum-mechanical description of microscopic systems from basic principles in the context of some simple models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $4$-dimensional semi-holomorphic Chern-Simons theory of Costello and Yamazaki provides a gauge-theoretic origin for the Lax connection of $2$-dimensional integrable field theories. The purpose of this paper is to extend this framework to the setting of $3$-dimensional integrable field theories by considering a $5$-dimensional semi-holomorphic higher Chern-Simons theory for a higher connection $(A,B)$ on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{C}P^1$. The input data for this theory are the choice of a meromorphic $1$-form $\omega$ on $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and a strict Lie $2$-group with cyclic structure on its underlying Lie $2$-algebra. Integrable field theories on $\mathbb{R}^3$ are constructed by imposing suitable boundary conditions on the connection $(A,B)$ at the $3$-dimensional defects located at the poles of $\omega$ and choosing certain admissible meromorphic solutions of the bulk equations of motion. The latter provides a natural notion of higher Lax connection for $3$-dimensional integrable field theories, including a $2$-form component $B$ which can be integrated over Cauchy surfaces to produce conserved charges. As a first application of this approach, we show how to construct a generalization of Ward's $(2+1)$-dimensional integrable chiral model from a suitable choice of data in the $5$-dimensional theory.</description>
