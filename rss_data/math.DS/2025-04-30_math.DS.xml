      <title>Entropy based lower dimension bounds for finite-time prediction of Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithms, we provide lower bounds on the dimension of a finite-dimensional subspace $F \subseteq \mathrm{L}^2(\mathrm{X})$ required for predicting the behavior of dynamical systems over long time horizons. We distinguish between two cases: (i) If $F$ is determined by a finite partition of $X$ we derive a lower bound that depends on the dynamical measure-theoretic entropy of the partition. (ii) We consider general finite-dimensional subspaces $F$ and establish a lower bound for the dimension of $F$ that is contingent on the spectral structure of the Koopman operator of the system, via the approximation entropy of $F$ as studied by Voiculescu. Furthermore, we motivate the use of delay observables to improve the predictive qualities of Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the closure of irregular orbits of the horocyclic flow on infinite finness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological dynamics of the horocyclic flow h_R on the unit tangent bundle of a geometrically finite hyperbolic surface is well known. In particular on such a surface the flow h_R is minimal or the minimal sets are the periodic orbits. When the surface is geometrically infinite, the situation is more complex and the presence of possible irregular orbits makes the description of minimal sets complicated. In this text, we construct a family of infinite hyperbolic surfaces for which the horocyclic flow defined on the unit tangent bundle is not minimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a rigidity property in non-Archimedean dynamics, reminiscent of Zdunik theorem in complex dynamics: every rational map whose equilibrium measure charges an interval in the Berkovich projective line is affine Bernoulli. Our proof is inspired by the construction of the affine model of multimodal maps by Parry and by Milnor and Thurston. This rigidity result allows us to show that the topological entropy of any tame rational map is the logarithm of an integer. To that end we analyze the properties of the multiplicative (sub)coboundary given by the spherical derivative and we establish a link between the sign of the Lyapunov exponent and the locus of wild ramification.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of some subsets of the Lagrange and Markov spectra near $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sets $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{M}\setminus\mathcal{L}$ near $3$, where $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ are the classical Lagrange and Markov spectra. More specifically, we construct a strictly decreasing sequence $\{a_r\}_{r\in \mathbb{N}}$ converging to $3$, such that for any $r$ one can find a subset $\mathcal{B}_r\subset (a_{r+1},a_r)\cap \mathcal{L}^{'}$ with the property that the Hausdorff dimension of $((a_{r+1},a_r)\cap \mathcal{L})\setminus \mathcal{B}_r$ is less than the Hausdorff dimension of $\mathcal{B}_r$ and for $t\in \mathcal{B}_r$ the sets of irrational numbers with Lagrange value bounded by $t$ and exactly $t$ respectively, have the same Hausdorff dimension. We also show that, as $t$ varies in $\mathcal{B}_r$, this Hausdorff dimension is a strictly increasing function. Finally, in relation to $\mathcal{M}\setminus \mathcal{L}$, we find $C&gt;0$ such that we can bound from above the Hausdorff dimension of $(\mathcal{M}\setminus \mathcal{L})\cap (-\infty,3+\rho)$ by $\frac{\log (\abs{\log \rho})-\log (\log(\abs{\log \rho}))+C}{\abs{\log \rho}}$ if $\rho&gt;0$ is small.</description>

      <title>Switching, Multiple Time-Scales and Geometric Blow-Up in a Low-Dimensional Gene Regulatory Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ODE-based models for gene regulatory networks (GRNs) can often be formulated as smooth singular perturbation problems with multiple small parameters, some of which are related to time-scale separation, whereas others are related to 'switching' (proximity to a non-smooth singular limit). This motivates the study of reduced models obtained after (i) quasi-steady state reduction (QSSR), which utilises the time-scale separation, and (ii) piecewise-smooth approximations, which reduce the nonlinearity of the model by viewing highly nonlinear sigmoidal terms as singular perturbations of step functions. We investigate the interplay between the reduction methods (i)-(ii), in the context of a 4-dimensional GRN which has been used as a low-dimensional representative of an important class of (generally high-dimensional) GRN models in the literature. We begin by identifying a region in the small parameter plane for which this problem can be formulated as a smooth singularly perturbed system on a blown-up space, uniformly in the switching parameter. This allows us to apply Fenichel's coordinate-free theorems and obtain a rigorous reduction to a 2-dimensional system, that is a perturbation of the QSSR. Finally, we show that the reduced system features a Hopf bifurcation which does not appear in the QSSR system, due to the influence of higher order terms. Taken together, our findings suggest that the relative size of the small parameters is important for the validity of QSS reductions and the determination of qualitative dynamics in GRN models more generally. Although the focus is on the 4-dimensional GRN, our approach is applicable to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Real-time blow-up and connection graphs of rational vector fields on the Riemann sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by pioneering work of Ky\^uya Masuda in the 1980s, only much more recent PDE studies address global boundedness versus finite-time blow-up. The two phenomena are related by passage from real to purely imaginary time. As a simple ODE example, we study scalar rational vector fields \begin{equation*} \label{*} \dot{w}=P(w)/Q(w), \tag{*} \end{equation*} for complex polynomials $P,Q$. We impose mild generic nondegeneracy conditions, including simplicity of poles and hyperbolicity of zeros. Generically, the real-time dynamics become gradient-like Morse. Poles play the role of hyperbolic saddle points. Towards poles, however, solutions may blow up in finite time.
  On the Riemann sphere $w\in\widehat{\mathbb{C}}$, we classify the resulting global dynamics up to $C^0$ orbit equivalence, in real time. This relies on a global description of the connection graph of blow-up orbits, from sources towards saddles/poles, in forward time. Time reversal identifies the dual graph of blow-down orbits. We show that the blow-up and blow-down graphs of (*) realize all finite multi-graphs on $\mathbb{S}^2$.
  The purely polynomial case $Q=1$ realizes all planar trees, alias diagrams of non-intersecting circle chords. The anti-holomorphic cousin $P=1$ realizes all noncrossing trees with vertices restricted to circles. This classification identifies combinatorial counts for the number of global phase portraits, which only depend on the degrees of $P$ and $Q$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sharpening Vahlen's result in Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: n this paper we refine Vahlen's 1895 result in Diophantine approximation by providing sharper bounds for the approximation coefficients, especially when at least one of the partial quotients $a_n$ or $a_{n+1}$ of the regular continued fraction expansion $[a_0;a_1,a_2,\dots]$ of $x$ is 1. An improvement of Vahlen's result was already given in papers by Jaroslav Han\u{c}l ([9]), Han\u{c}l and Silvie Bahnerova ([10]), and by Dinesh Sharma Bhattarai ([5]), but the approach of the present paper is very different from Han\u{c}l c.s. We believe that the geometrical methods used in this paper not only offer a significant improvement over Vahlen's result, but also yield new insights that can contribute to improving Borel's classical constant.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and local complexity of Delone sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study complexity and periodicity of Delone sets by applying an algebraic approach to multidimensional symbolic dynamics. In this algebraic approach, $\mathbb{Z}^d$-configurations $c: \mathbb{Z}^d \to \mathcal{A}$ for a finite set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ and finite $\mathbb{Z}^d$-patterns are regarded as formal power series and Laurent polynomials, respectively. In this paper we study also functions $c: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathcal{A}$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is as above. These functions are called $\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations. Any Delone set may be regarded as an $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration by simply presenting it as its indicator function. Conversely, any $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration whose support (that is, the set of cells for which the configuration gets non-zero values) is a Delone set can be seen as a colored Delone set. We generalize the concept of annihilators and periodizers of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-configurations for $\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations. We show that if an $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration has a non-trivial annihilator, that is, if a linear combination of some finitely many of its translations is the zero function, then it has an annihilator of a particular form. Moreover, we show that $\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations with integer coefficients that have non-trivial annihilators are sums of finitely many periodic functions $c_1,\ldots,c_m: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{Z}$. Also, $\mathbb{R}^d$-pattern complexity is studied alongside with the classical patch-complexity of Delone sets. We point out the fact that sufficiently low $\mathbb{R}^d$-pattern complexity of an $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration implies the existence of non-trivial annihilators. Moreover, it is shown that if a Meyer set has sufficiently slow patch-complexity growth, then it has a non-trivial annihilator. Finally, a condition for forced periodicity of colored Delone sets of finite local complexity is provided.</description>

      <title>Influence network reconstruction from discrete time-series of count data modelled by multidimensional Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying key influencers from time series data without a known prior network structure is a challenging problem in various applications, from crime analysis to social media. While much work has focused on event-based time series (timestamp) data, fewer methods address count data, where event counts are recorded in fixed intervals. We develop network inference methods for both batched and sequential count data. Here the strong network connection represents the key influences among the nodes. We introduce an ensemble-based algorithm, rooted in the expectation-maximization (EM) framework, and demonstrate its utility to identify node dynamics and connections through a discrete-time Cox or Hawkes process. For the linear multidimensional Hawkes model, we employ a minimization-majorization (MM) approach, allowing for parallelized inference of networks. For sequential inference, we use a second-order approximation of the Bayesian inference problem. Under certain assumptions, a rank-1 update for the covariance matrix reduces computational costs. We validate our methods on synthetic data and real-world datasets, including email communications within European academic communities. Our approach effectively reconstructs underlying networks, accounting for both excitation and diffusion influences. This work advances network reconstruction from count data in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Freezing Phase Transitions for Lattice Systems and Higher-Dimensional Subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X = \mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$, where $d \geq 1$ and $\mathcal{A}$ is a finite set, equipped with the action of the shift map. For a given continuous potential $\phi: \mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}^d} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $\beta&gt;0$ (``inverse temperature''), there exists a (nonempty) set of equilibrium states $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi)$. The potential $\phi$ is said to exhibit a ``freezing phase transition'' if $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi) = \mathrm{ES}(\beta'\phi)$ for all $\beta, \beta' &gt; \beta_c$, while $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi) \neq \mathrm{ES}(\beta'\phi)$ for any $\beta &lt; \beta_c &lt; \beta'$, where $\beta_c\in (0,\infty)$ is a critical inverse temperature depending on $\phi$. In this paper, given any proper subshift $X_0$ of $X$, we explicitly construct a continuous potential $\phi: X \to \mathbb{R}$ for which there exists $\beta_c \in (0,\infty)$ such that $\mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi)$ coincides with the set of measures of maximal entropy on $X_0$ for all $\beta &gt; \beta_c$, whereas for all $\beta &lt; \beta_c$, $\mu(X_0)=0$ for all $\mu\in \mathrm{ES}(\beta\phi)$. This phenomenon was previously studied only for $d = 1$ in the context of dynamical systems and for restricted classes of subshifts, with significant motivation stemming from quasicrystal models. Additionally, we prove that under a natural summability condition -- satisfied, for instance, by finite-range potentials or exponentially decaying potentials -- freezing phase transitions are impossible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized strata of meromorphic differentials are loci within the usual strata of differentials where certain sets of residues sum to zero. They naturally appear in the boundary of the multi-scale compactification of the usual strata. The classification of generalized strata is a key step towards understanding the irreducible components of the boundary strata of the multi-scale compactification. The connected components of generalized strata of residueless differentials were classified in \cite{lee2023connected}. In the present paper, we classify the connected components of generalized strata of meromorphic differentials in full generality.</description>

      <title>Phase-locking in dynamical systems and quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss the Prufer transform that connects the dynamical system on the torus and the Hill equation, which is interpreted as either the equation of motion for the parametric oscillator or the Schrodinger equation with periodic potential. The structure of phase-locking domains in the dynamical system on torus is mapped into the band-gap structure of the Hill equation. For the parametric oscillator, we provide the relation between the non-adiabatic Hannay angle and the Poincare rotation number of the corresponding dynamical system. In terms of quantum mechanics, the integer rotation number is connected to the quantization number via the Milne quantization approach and exact WKB. Using recent results concerning the exact WKB approach in quantum mechanics, we discuss the possible non-perturbative effects in the dynamical systems on the torus and for parametric oscillator. The semiclassical WKB is interpreted in the framework of a slow-fast dynamical system. The link between the classification of the coadjoint Virasoro orbits and the Hill equation yields a classification of the phase-locking domains in the parameter space in terms of the classification of Virasoro orbits. Our picture is supported by numerical simulations for the model of the Josephson junction and Mathieu equation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Hard Thresholding for Sparse Model Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many model selection algorithms rely on sparse dictionary learning to provide interpretable and physics-based governing equations. The optimization algorithms typically use a hard thresholding process to enforce sparse activations in the model coefficients by removing library elements from consideration. By introducing an annealing scheme that reactivates a fraction of the removed terms with a cooling schedule, we are able to improve the performance of these sparse learning algorithms. We concentrate on two approaches to the optimization, SINDy, and an alternative using hard thresholding pursuit. We see in both cases that annealing can improve model accuracy. The effectiveness of annealing is demonstrated through comparisons on several nonlinear systems pulled from convective flows, excitable systems, and population dynamics. Finally we apply these algorithms to experimental data for projectile motion.</description>

Abstract: In dynamical systems characterized by separation of time scales, the approximation of so called ``slow manifolds'', on which the long term dynamics lie, is a useful step for model reduction. Initializing on such slow manifolds is a useful step in modeling, since it circumvents fast transients, and is crucial in multiscale algorithms alternating between fine scale (fast) and coarser scale (slow) simulations. In a similar spirit, when one studies the infinite time dynamics of systems depending on parameters, the system attractors (e.g., its steady states) lie on bifurcation diagrams. Sampling these manifolds gives us representative attractors (here, steady states of ODEs or PDEs) at different parameter values. Algorithms for the systematic construction of these manifolds are required parts of the ``traditional'' numerical nonlinear dynamics toolkit.
  In more recent years, as the field of Machine Learning develops, conditional score-based generative models (cSGMs) have demonstrated capabilities in generating plausible data from target distributions that are conditioned on some given label. It is tempting to exploit such generative models to produce samples of data distributions conditioned on some quantity of interest (QoI). In this work, we present a framework for using cSGMs to quickly (a) initialize on a low-dimensional (reduced-order) slow manifold of a multi-time-scale system consistent with desired value(s) of a QoI (a ``label'') on the manifold, and (b) approximate steady states in a bifurcation diagram consistent with a (new, out-of-sample) parameter value. This conditional sampling can help uncover the geometry of the reduced slow-manifold and/or approximately ``fill in'' missing segments of steady states in a bifurcation diagram.</description>

      <title>Safe and Optimal N-Spacecraft Swarm Reconfiguration in Non-Keplerian Cislunar Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fuel-optimal guidance and control methodology for spacecraft swarm reconfiguration in Restricted Multi-Body Problems (RMBPs) with a guarantee of passive safety, maintaining miss distance even under abrupt loss of control authority. A new set of constraints exploits a quasi-periodic structure of RMBPs to guarantee passive safety. Particularly, this can be expressed as simple geometric constraints by solving optimal control in Local Toroidal Coordinates, which is based on a local eigenspace of a quasi-periodic motion around the corresponding periodic orbit. The proposed formulation enables a significant simplification of problem structure, which is highly applicable to large-scale swarm reconfiguration in cislunar orbits. The method is demonstrated in various models of RMBPs (Elliptical Restricted Three-Body Problem and Bi-Circular Restricted Four-Body Problem) and also validated in the full-ephemeris dynamics. By extending and generalizing well-known concepts from the two- to the three- and four-body problems, this paper lays the foundation for the practical control schemes of relative motion in cislunar space.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Levins metapopulation model to time varying colonization and extinction rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metapopulation theory explores the population persistence in fragmented habitats by considering a balance between the extinction of local populations and recolonization of empty sites. In general, the extinction and colonization rates have been considered as constant parameters and the novelty of this paper is to assume that they are subject to deterministic variations. We noticed that an averaging approach proposed by C. Puccia and R. Levins can be adapted to construct the upper and lower averages of the difference between the extinction and colonization rates, whose sign is useful to determine either the permanence or the extinction of the metapopulation. In fact, we use these averages to revisit the classical model introduced by R. Levins. From a mathematical perspective, these averages can be seen as Bohl exponents whereas the corresponding analysis is carried out by using tools of non autonomous dynamics. Last but not least, compared with the Levins model, the resulting dynamics of the time varying model shares the persistence/extinction scenario when the above stated upper and lower averages have the same sign but also raises open questions about metapopulation persistence in the case of the averages have different sign.</description>

      <title>Warehouse storage and retrieval optimization via clustering, dynamic systems modeling, and GPU-accelerated routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a warehouse optimization procedure aimed at enhancing the efficiency of product storage and retrieval. By representing product locations and order flows within a time-evolving graph structure, we employ unsupervised clustering to define and refine compact order regions, effectively reducing picking distances. We describe the procedure using a dynamic mathematical model formulated using tools from random dynamical systems theory, enabling a principled analysis of the system's behavior over time even under random operational variations. For routing within this framework, we implement a parallelized Bellman-Ford algorithm, utilizing GPU acceleration to evaluate path segments efficiently. To address scalability challenges inherent in large routing graphs, we introduce a segmentation strategy that preserves performance while maintaining tractable memory requirements. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in both operational efficiency and computational feasibility for large-scale warehouse environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The L\'evy-Khintchine theorem is a classical result in Diophantine approximation that describes the asymptotic growth of the denominators of convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. In this work, we make this theorem effective by establishing an explicit rate of convergence. Our result extends to the setting of higher-dimensional simultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version of a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS}, 2024). In addition, we prove a central limit theorem for best approximations. Our approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the structure of the dimension spectrum for continued fraction expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the dimension spectrum of continued fractions expansions with coefficients restricted to infinite subsets of $ \mathbb{N}$. We prove that the set of powers $P_q=\{q^n\colon n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ has full dimension spectrum for each integer $q\geq 2$, answering a question by Chousionis, Leykekhman and Urba\'nski. On the other hand, we show that the dimension spectrum for $P^*_q=\{q^n\colon n\in \mathbb{N}\}\cup\{1\}$ has many gaps and regions where it is nowhere dense. We also investigate the case where $A$ is generated by a monomial, $M_q=\{n^q\colon n\in\mathbb{N}\}$. For $M_q$ we prove that the dimension spectrum is full for $q\in\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, and it has a gap for each $q\geq 6$. Furthermore we show for $q\in\{6,7,8\}$ that the dimension spectrum of $M_q$ is the disjoint union of two nontrivial closed intervals, and it is the disjoint union of three nontrivial closed intervals for $q \in\{9,10\}$. For $q\geq 11$ we show that the dimension spectrum of $M_q$ consists of finitely many disjoint nontrivial closed intervals. The results concerning $M_q$ extend existing results for $q=1$ and $q=2$. In our analysis we employ Perron-Frobenius (transfer) operators, and numerical tools developed by Falk and Nussbaum that give rigorous estimates for the Hausdorff dimension for continued fractions expansions.</description>

      <title>Stabilising millennial oscillations in large-scale ocean circulation with a delayed feedback due to a circumpolar current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07883v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global ocean circulation plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Earth's climate. The specific pattern and strength of circulation also determines how carbon and nutrients are cycled and via the resulting distribution of dissolved oxygen, where habitats suitable for marine animals occur. However, evidence from both geological data and models suggests that state transitions in circulation patterns have occurred in the past. Understanding the controls on marine environmental conditions and biodiversity requires a full appreciation of the nature and drivers of such transitions. Here we present stable millennial oscillations of meridional overturning circulation in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, cGENIE, that appear to only occur in the presence of a circumpolar current. To demonstrate that a circumpolar current can act as a driver of stable oscillations, we adapt a simple ocean box model to include a delayed feedback to represent the effect of a circumpolar current on meridional overturning circulation. We investigate the millennial oscillatory solutions that arise in the box model by bifurcation analysis and show that the model can reproduce the same bifurcation structure observed in the Earth system model. Our results provide new insights into the nature of oscillations that could have occurred under certain continental configurations in the geological past, and also highlight the potential influence of the changing Antarctic circumpolar current speed on the stability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.</description>

Abstract: We prove extreme value laws for cusp excursions of the horocycle flow in the case of surfaces of constant negative curvature. The key idea of our approach is to study the hitting time distribution for shrinking Poincar\'e sections that have a particularly simple scaling property under the action of the geodesic flow. This extends the extreme value law of Kirsebom and Mallahi-Karai [arXiv:2209.07283] for cusp excursions for the modular surface. Here we show that the limit law can be expressed in terms of Hall's formula for the gap distribution of the Farey sequence.</description>

      <title>Scalar polynomial vector fields in real and complex time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, the simplest scalar ODE case is studied for polynomials $$ \dot{w}=f(w)=(w-e_0)\cdot\ldots\cdot(w-e_{d-1}) $$ of degree $d$ with $d$ simple complex zeros. The explicit solution by separation of variables and explicit integration is an almost trivial matter.
  In a classical spirit, indeed, we describe the complex Riemann surface $\mathcal{R}$ of the global nontrivial solution $(t,w(t))$ in complex time, as an unbranched cover of the punctured Riemann sphere. The flow property, however, fails at $w=\infty$. The global consequences depend on the period map of the residues $2\pi\mathrm{i}/f'(e_j)$ of $1/f$ at the punctures, in detail. We therefore show that polynomials $f$ exist for arbitrarily prescribed residues with zero sum. This result is not covered by standard interpolation theory.
  Motivated by the PDE case, we also classify the planar real-time phase portraits of the above ODE.
  Poincar\'e compactification of $w$ regularizes $w=\infty$ by $2(d-1)$ equilibria, alternatingly stable and unstable within the invariant circle boundary at infinity. In structurally stable cases, we classify all compactified phase portraits, up to orientation preserving orbit equivalence and time reversal. Combinatorially, their connection graphs are equivalent to certain unrooted, unlabeled, undirected planar trees of $d$ vertices or, dually, to certain chord diagrams with $d-1$ nonintersecting chords. We sketch a proof that all planar trees are actually realized by Poincar\'e compactifications.
  Not least, we offer a 1,000 Euro reward for the discovery, or refutation, of complex entire homoclinic orbits.</description>

      <title>On the Lyapunov spectrum of the twisted cocycle for substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the properties of a complex matrix ``twisted,'' otherwise called ``spectral,'' cocycle, associated with substitution dynamical systems. Following a recent finding of Rajabzadeh and Safaee [arXiv:2501.16824] of an invariant section for the twisted cocycle, we indicate that this implies presence of a zero Lyapunov exponent. This has consequences for the spectral properties of substitution dynamical systems; in particular, this extends the scope and simplifies the proof of singular spectrum for a large class of substitutions on two symbols. We also obtain some results on positivity of the top exponent. In the appendix we compute the Lebesgue almost everywhere local dimension of spectral measures of some ``simple'' test functions, for almost every irrational rotation. This sheds some light on the earlier work of Bufetov and the author, relating the local dimension of spectral measures to pointwise Lyapunov exponents of the twisted cocycle. It should be noted that the paper has some (mutually acknowledged) overlap with [arXiv:2501.16824, Appendix].</description>

      <title>Quantization for a condensation system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given $r \in (0, +\infty)$, the quantization dimension of order $r$, if it exists, denoted by $D_r(\mu)$, represents the rate at which the $n$th quantization error of order $r$ approaches to zero as the number of elements $n$ in an optimal set of $n$-means for $\mu$ tends to infinity. If $D_r(\mu)$ does not exist, we define $\underline{D}_r(\mu)$ and $\overline{D}_r(\mu)$ as the lower and the upper quantization dimensions of $\mu$ of order $r$, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension of the condensation measure $\mu$ associated with a condensation system $(\{S_j\}_{j=1}^N, (p_j)_{j=0}^N, \nu).$ We provide two examples: one where $\nu$ is an infinite discrete distribution on $\mathbb{R}$, and one where $\nu$ is a uniform distribution on $\mathbb{R}$. For both the discrete and uniform distributions $\nu$, we determine the optimal sets of $n$-means, and calculate the quantization dimensions of condensation measures $\mu$, and show that the $D_r(\mu)$-dimensional quantization coefficients do not exist. Moreover, we demonstrate that the lower and upper quantization coefficients are finite and positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit voltage-clamp electrophysiology, a feedback-control method that has successfully been applied to study neuronal (non)linear current-voltage relationships. Yet its full scope has not been explored to date. We reinterpret the voltage-clamp protocol under slow variation of the feedback reference signal using the language of multiple-timescale dynamical systems theory. Gauged under this new epistemic step, we unveil non-observable (hidden) states. More specifically, the experimental measurements from voltage clamp can be put into correspondence with predictions of both stable and unstable states from dynamical systems theory. We demonstrate a general protocol for constructing systematically experimental steady-state bifurcation diagrams for electrophysiologically active cells. We perform our experiments on entorhinal cortex neurons, both excitatory (pyramidal neurons) and inhibitiory (interneurons). Moreover, employing a current-clamp open-loop electrophysiology protocol with slow variation of an applied electrical current drives the neuron to dynamically transition between its observable rest states and its observable spiking states, hence revealing experimental dynamic bifurcations. Overlaying the two aforementioned protocols produces a map of all these neuronal states and effectively leads to an experimental validation of the classical slow-fast dissection method introduced by J. Rinzel in the 1980s and routinely applied ever since in order to analyse slow-fast neuronal models. Our approach opens doors to observing further complex hidden states with more advanced control strategies, allowing to control real cells beyond pharmacological manipulations.</description>

      <title>The Maslov index, degenerate crossings and the stability of pulse solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04003v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the scalar Swift-Hohenberg equation with quadratic-cubic nonlinearity, it is known that symmetric pulse solutions exist for certain parameter regions. In this paper we develop a method to determine the spectral stability of these solutions by associating a Maslov index to them. This requires extending the method of computing the Maslov index introduced by Robbin and Salamon [Topology 32, no.4 (1993): 827-844] to so-called degenerate crossings. We extend their formulation of the Maslov index to degenerate crossings of general order in the case where the intersection is fully degenerate, meaning that if the dimension of the intersection is k, then each of the k crossings is a degenerate one. We then argue that, in this case, this index coincides with the number of unstable eigenvalues for the linearized evolution equation. Furthermore, we develop a numerical method to compute the Maslov index associated to symmetric pulse solutions. Finally, we consider several solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation and use our method to characterize their stability.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the geometry of the rolling distribution on the special orthogonal group and show that almost all right-invariant sub-Riemannian metrics defined on this distribution have completely integrable geodesic flows. Our argument is an adaptation of the method used to establish integrability of the Riemannian metric arising from the $n$-dimensional rigid body: namely, by exhibiting a Lax pair and bi-Hamiltonian structure for the reduced equations of motion.</description>
