      <title>Hyperelliptic tangential covers and even elliptic finite-gap potentials, back and forth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,\omega_0):=(\mathbb{C}/\Lambda,0)$ denote the elliptic curve associated to the lattice $\Lambda$, $X_2:=\{\omega_0,\cdots, \omega_3\}$ its set of half-periods and $\wp:X \to \mathbb{P}^1$ the usual Weierstrass $\wp$ function, with a double pole at the origin $\omega_0$. Fix $(\alpha,m)\in \mathbb{N}^4\times \mathbb{N}$ and consider a function $$u_\xi(x) = \sum_0^3 \alpha_i(\alpha_i+1)\wp(x\,\textrm{-}\,\omega_i) +2\sum_{j=1}^m \left(\wp(x\, \textrm{-}\, \rho_j)+\wp(x+\rho_j)\right),$$ where $\{\rho_j\} \in (X \setminus X_2)^{(m)}$. The latter is known to be a so-called (even, $\Lambda$-periodic) finite-gap potential, if and only if $\{\rho_j\} $ satisfies the so-called (D-G) square system of equations. We let $\mathcal{P}ot_X(\alpha,m)$ denote the set of such potentials. Any such potential corresponds to a unique spectral data $(\pi,\xi)$, where $\pi: \Gamma \to X$ is a hyperelliptic tangential cover of degree $n:=\frac{1}{2}(\sum_i\alpha_i(\alpha_i+1)+4m)$ and $\xi$ a $\theta$-characteristic of the spectral curve $\Gamma$. The problem at stake is to find out all spectral data of the family $\mathcal{P}ot_X(m) := \bigcup_{\alpha\in \mathbb{N}^4} \mathcal{P}ot_X(\alpha,m),$ for any $m$. The latter problem has been thoroughly studied for $\mathcal{P}ot_X(0)$ and $\mathcal{P}ot_X(1)$. In this article we go one step further, by studying all spectral data of each family $\mathcal{P}ot_X(\alpha,2)$. We find the bound $\#\mathcal{P}ot_X(\alpha,2)\leq 27$, for any $\alpha\in \mathbb{N}^4$, with equality for a generic elliptic curve $X$. We also find a formula for the arithmetic geni of the corresponding spectral curves in terms of $\alpha$, which we generalize to $\mathcal{P}ot_X(\alpha,m)$ for any $m$. At last, we conclude with a natural conjecture, leading to a recursive formula in $d\in \mathbb{N}$, for the cardinals of $\mathcal{P}ot_X(\alpha,d)$.</description>

      <title>Abhyankar-Moh Semigroups for arbitrary hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an arbitrary hypersurface singularity, we construct a family of semigroups associated with algebraically closed fields that arise as an infinite union of rings of series. These semigroups extend the value semigroup of a plane curve studied by Abhyankar and Moh. The algebraically closed fields under consideration possess a natural valuation that induces a corresponding value semigroup. We establish the necessary conditions under which these semigroups are independent of the choice of the root. Moreover, the extensions proposed by P. Gonz\'alez and Kiyek-Micus, where Gonz\'alez specifically addresses the case of quasi-ordinary singularities, and the extension introduced by Abbas-Assi, can be understood as particular instances within our constructed family.</description>

      <title>Optimal upper bound for degrees of canonical Fano threefolds of Picard number one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a $\mathbb Q$-factorial canonical Fano $3$-fold $X$ of Picard number $1$, $(-K_X)^3\leq 72$. The main tool is a Kawamata--Miyaoka type inequality which relates $(-K_X)^3$ with $\hat{c}_2(X)\cdot c_1(X)$, where $\hat{c}_2(X)$ is the generalized second Chern class.</description>

      <title>Postulation for 2-superfat points in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the postulation of 0-dimensional schemes given by unions of 2-superfat points in general position in the plane, i.e., the union of local schemes defined by the intersection of two distinct double lines. We prove that such schemes have good postulation, i.e., they have the expected Hilbert function. We also show the good postulation of such schemes when we add a general 3-fat point. Finally, we use these results to answer a peculiar kind of interpolation problem.</description>

      <title>Tropical rational curves with first order tangency via WDVV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the tropical counterpart of the enumeration of rational curves in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ with first order tangency. We use the tropical analogue of the WDVV technique to compute rational tropical plane curves of degree $d$ tangent to a degree $l$ tropical plane curve and passing through $3d-2$ points in general position. As Mikhalkin's correspondence suggests, our numbers agree with earlier results on tangency in complex geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a family of reductive groups, including all reductive groups up to a given rank. We also construct a similar versal family of quasi-split reductive groups. This result generalizes a former result of N.Avni and R.Aizenbud and provides a framework for systematically studying invariants of reductive groups with bounded rank.</description>

      <title>BCM-thresholds of non-principal ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing previous work of the first author, we introduce and study a characteristic free analog of the $F$-threshold for non-principal ideals. We show that this coincides with the classical $F$-threshold for weakly $F$-regular rings and that the set of $F$-thresholds coincides with the set of $F$-jumping numbers in a regular ring. We obtain results on $F$-thresholds of parameter ideals analogous to results of Huneke-Musta{\c{t}}{\u{a}}-Takagi-Watanabe. Instead of taking ordinary powers of ideal, our definition uses fractional integral closure in an absolute integral closure of our ambient ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bounded derived category $\mathcal{D}$ of an Euclidean quiver, or equivalently, that of coherent sheaves on a tame weighted projective line. We give a description of the moduli space $\mathrm{ToSS}$ of the total semi-stability conditions on $\mathcal{D}$, which implies that $\mathrm{ToSS}$ can linearly contract to any chosen non-concentrated stability condition in it. For type $\widetilde{A_{p,q}}$, this gives an alternative proof of the contractibility of the whole space of stability conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Kummer pro-\'etale cohomology of $\mathbb B_{\operatorname{dR}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $p$-adic cohomologies of log rigid analytic varieties over a $p$-adic field. For a log rigid analytic variety $X$ defined over a discretely valued field, we compute the Kummer pro-\'etale cohomology of $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$ and $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}$. When $X$ is defined over $\mathbb{C}_p$, we introduce a logarithmic ${B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$-cohomology theory, serving as a deformation of log de Rham cohomology. Additionally, we establish the log de Rham-\'etale comparison in this setting and prove the degeneration of both the Hodge-Tate and Hodge-log de Rham spectral sequences for $X$ defined over a discretely valued field or admitting a proper semistable formal model over $\operatorname{Spf}(\mathcal{O}_C)$.</description>

      <title>Rational points and rational moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety over $\mathbb Q$, and let $M$ be a (rational) moduli space over $\mathbb Q$ of abelian varieties with $dim(M)&gt;dim(X)$. We study $X(\mathbb Q)$ by constructing via $M$ an open dense moduli space $U\subseteq X$, whose forgetful morphism gives a Par{\v{s}}in construction for $U(\mathbb Q)$ if $X$ satisfies a geometric non-degenerate criterion. For example, if $M$ is a Hilbert modular variety, then $U$ is a coarse Hilbert moduli scheme and $X$ is non-degenerate iff a closure $\bar{U}\subset \bar{M}$ contains no singular points of the minimal compactification $\bar{M}$.
  We study various geometric aspects of the non-degenerate criterion and we deduce arithmetic applications: If $X$ is non-degenerate, then $U(\mathbb Q)$ is finite by Faltings. Moreover, our constructions are made for the effective strategy which combines the method of Faltings (Arakelov, Par{\v{s}}in, Szpiro) with modularity and Masser--W\"ustholz isogeny estimates. When $M$ is a coarse Hilbert moduli scheme, we use this strategy to explicitly bound the height and the number of $x\in U(\mathbb Q)$ if $X$ is non-degenerate.
  We illustrate our approach for the classical surface $\bar{M}^{ico}\subset \mathbb P^4:\sigma_2=0=\sigma_4$. For any curve $X$ over $\mathbb Q$, we construct and study explicit models $\bar{U}\subset \bar{M}^{ico}$ of $X$ called ico models. If $X$ is non-degenerate, then we give via $\bar{U}$ an effective Par{\v{s}}in construction and an explicit Weil height bound for $x\in U(\mathbb Q)$. As most ico models are non-degenerate and $X\setminus U$ is controlled, this establishes the effective Mordell conjecture for large classes of (explicit) curves over $\mathbb Q$. We also solve the ico analogue of the generalized Fermat problem by combining our height bounds with Diophantine approximations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quadratic pairs for Azumaya algebras with involutions over a base scheme S as defined by Calm{\`e}s and Fasel, generalizing the case of quadratic pairs on central simple algebras over a field (Knus, Merkurjev, Rost, Tignol). We describe a cohomological obstruction for an Azumaya algebra over S with orthogonal involution to admit a quadratic pair. When S is affine this obstruction vanishes, however it is non-trivial in general. In particular, we construct explicit examples with non-trivial obstructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01722v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global analogue of a Henselian local ring is a Henselian pair-a ring R and an ideal I which satisfy a condition resembling Hensel's lemma regarding lifting coprime factorizations of monic polynomials over R/I to factorizations over R. The geometric counterpart is the notion of a Henselian scheme, which can serve as a substitute for formal schemes in applications such as deformation theory. In this paper we prove a GAGA-style cohomology comparison result for Henselian schemes in positive characteristic, making use of a "Henselian \'etale" topology defined in previous work in order to leverage exactness of finite pushforward for abelian sheaves in the \'etale topology of schemes. We will also discuss algebraizability of coherent sheaves on the Henselization of a proper scheme, proving (without a positive characteristic restriction) algebraizability for coherent subsheaves. We can then deduce a Henselian version of Chow's theorem on algebraization and the algebraizability of maps between Henselizations of proper schemes.</description>

      <title>Ulrich sheaves, the arithmetic writhe and algebraic isotopies of space curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a connection between the theory of Ulrich sheaves and $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory. For instance, we prove that the $\mathbb{A}^1$-degree of a morphism between projective varieties, that is relatively oriented by an Ulrich sheaf, is constant on the target even when it is not $\mathbb{A}^1$-chain connected or $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected. Further if an embedded projective variety is the support of a symmetric Ulrich sheaf of rank one, the $\mathbb{A}^1$-degree of all its linear projections can be read off in an explicit way from the free resolution of the Ulrich sheaf. Finally, we construct an Ulrich sheaf on the secant variety of a curve and use this to define an arithmetic version of Viro's encomplexed writhe for curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$. This can be considered to be an arithmetic analogue of a knot invariant. Namely, we define a notion of algebraic isotopy under which the arithmetic writhe is invariant. For rational curves of degree at most four in $\mathbb{P}^3$ we obtain a complete classification up to algebraic isotopies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish two-pointed Prym-Brill-Noether loci with special vanishing at two points, and determine their K-theory classes when the dimensions are as expected. The classes are derived by the applications of a formula for the K-theory of certain vexillary degeneracy loci in type D. In particular, we show a two-pointed version of Prym-Petri theorem on the expected dimension in the general case, with a coupled Prym-Petri map. Our approach is inspired by the work on pointed cases by Tarasca, and we generalize unpointed cases by De Concini-Pragacz and Welters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Terracini locus $\mathbb{T}(n, d; x)$ is the locus of all finite subsets $S$ of $ \mathbb{P}^n$ of cardinality $x$ such that $\langle S \rangle = \mathbb{P}^n$, $h^0(\mathcal{I}_{2S}(d)) &gt; 0$, and $h^1(\mathcal{I}_{2S}(d)) &gt; 0$. The celebrated Alexander-Hirschowitz Theorem classifies the triples $(n,d,x)$ for which $\dim\mathbb{T}(n, d; x)=xn$. Here we fully characterize the next step in the case $n=2$, namely, we prove that $\mathbb{T}(2,d;x)$ has at least one irreducible component of dimension $2x-1$ if and only if either $(d,x)=(4,4)$, or $(d,x)=(6,10)$, or $d\equiv 1,2 \pmod{3}$, $d\ge 5$ and $x=(d+2)(d+1)/6$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic geometry of character varieties with regular monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02171v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study character varieties arising as moduli of representations of an orientable surface group into a reductive group $G$. We first show that if $G/Z$ acts freely on the representation variety, then both the representation variety and the character variety are smooth and equidimensional. Next, we count points on a family of smooth character varieties; namely, those involving both regular semisimple and regular unipotent monodromy. In particular, we show that these varieties are polynomial count and obtain an explicit expression for their $E$-polynomials. Finally, by analysing the $E$-polynomial, we determine certain topological invariants of these varieties such as the Euler characteristic and the number of connected components. As an application, we give an example of a cohomologically rigid representation which is not physically rigid.</description>

      <title>On fields of meromorphic functions on neighborhoods of rational curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $F$ is a smooth and connected complex surface (not necessarily compact) containing a smooth rational curve with positive self-intersection. We prove that if there exists a non-constant meromorphic function on $F$, then the field of meromorphic functions on $F$ is isomorphic to the field of rational functions in one or two variables over $\mathbb C$.</description>

      <title>Complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for positive $(p,p)$ forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for differential $(p,p)$ forms is introduced on compact K\"ahler manifolds. For any $1 \leq p &lt; n$, we show the existence of smooth solutions unique up to adding constants. For $p=1$, this corresponds to the Calabi-Yau theorem proved by S. T. Yau, and for $p=n-1$, this gives the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for $(n-1)$ plurisubharmonic functions solved by Tosatti-Weinkove. For other $p$ values, this defines a non-linear PDE that falls outside of the general framework of Caffarelli-Nirenberg-Spruck. Further, we define a geometric flow for higher-order forms that preserves their cohomology classes, and extends the K\"ahler-Ricci flow naturally to $(p,p)$ forms. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that this flow exists in a maximal time interval and can be shown to converge under some assumptions. A modified flow is introduced and the convergence of the associated normalized flow is shown. Some potential applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Crystals and Double Quiver Algebras from Jeffrey-Kirwan Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>
