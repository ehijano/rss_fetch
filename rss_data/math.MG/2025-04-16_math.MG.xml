      <title>Allard's interior $\varepsilon$-Regularity Theorem in Alexandrov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10758v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Allard's Interior $\varepsilon$-Regularity Theorem for $m$-dimensional varifolds with generalized mean curvature in $L^p_{loc}$, for $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $p&gt;m$, in Alexandrov spaces of dimension $n$ with double-sided bounded intrinsic sectional curvature. We first give an intrinsic proof of this theorem in the case of varifolds in Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n$ whose metric tensor is at least of class $\mathcal{C}^2$, without using Nash's Isometric Embedding Theorem. This approach provides explicitly computable constants that depend only on $n$, $m$, the injectivity radius and bounds on the sectional curvature, which is essential for proving our main theorem, as we establish it through a density argument in the topological space of Riemannian manifolds with positive lower bounds on the injectivity radius and double-sided bounds on sectional curvature, equipped with the $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ topology, for every $\alpha \in ]0,1[$ (in fact, it is enough with the $W^{2,q}$ topology for some suitable $q$ large enough).</description>

      <title>Obtuse almost-equiangular sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $t \in [-1, 1)$, a set of points on the $(n-1)$-dimensional unit sphere is called $t$-almost equiangular if among any three distinct points there is a pair with inner product $t$. We propose a semidefinite programming upper bound for the maximum cardinality $\alpha(n, t)$ of such a set based on an extension of the Lov\'asz theta number to hypergraphs. This bound is at least as good as previously known bounds and for many values of $n$ and $t$ it is better.
  We also refine existing spectral methods to show that $\alpha(n, t) \leq 2(n+1)$ for all $n$ and $t \leq 0$, with equality only at $t = -1/n$. This allows us to show the uniqueness of the optimal construction at $t = -1/n$ for $n \leq 5$ and to enumerate all possible constructions for $n \leq 3$ and $t \leq 0$.</description>

      <title>Limits of Discrete Energy of Families of Increasing Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hausdorff dimension of a set can be detected using the Riesz energy. Here, we consider situations where a sequence of points, $\{x_n\}$, ``fills in'' a set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ in an appropriate sense and investigate the degree to which the discrete analog to the Riesz energy of these sets can be used to bound the Hausdorff dimension of $E$. We also discuss applications to data science and Erd\H{o}s/Falconer type problems.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz geometry and combinatorics of circular snakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04446v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the Lipschitz geometric and combinatorial properties of germs of real semialgebraic surfaces (or, more generally, definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure) with circular link (homeomorphic to the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$). We define and investigate the outer Lipschitz geometry of the so-called circular snakes, showing what results in the paper "Lipschitz geometry and combinatorics of abnormal surface germs" (by Andrei Gabrielov and Emanoel Souza) valid to snakes still holds for the circular case. We prove the existence of a canonical decomposition for the Valette link of a circular snake into finitely many segments and nodal zones and establish some necessary and sufficient criteria to determine when it is possible to obtain a snake from a circular snake by "removing" either one of its segments or a H\"older triangle whose Valette link is contained in one of its nodal zones. We construct a combinatorial object associated with a circular snake and prove a realization theorem for this combinatorial object. We also present a weakly outer Lipschitz classification for circular snakes. Finally, we show some results about the combinatorics of binary circular snakes, which is wildly distinct from the corresponding case shown in the work of Gabrielov and Souza.</description>

      <title>Integral Varadhan formula for non-linear heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the integral Varadhan short-time formula for non-linear heat flow on measured Finsler manifolds. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first result establishing a Varadhan-type formula for non-linear semigroups. We do not assume the reversibility of the metric, and the distance function can be asymmetric. In this generality, we reveal that the probabilistic interpretation is well-suited for our formula; the probability that a particle starting from a set $A$ can be found in another set $B$ describes the distance from $A$ to $B$. One side of the estimates (the upper bound of the probability) is also established in the nonsmooth setting of infinitesimally strictly convex metric measure spaces satisfying the local Sobolev-to-Lipschitz property.</description>

      <title>The Analytic Stockwell Transform and its Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent original line of research in time--frequency analysis has shifted the interest in energy maxima toward zeros. Initially motivated by the intriguing uniform spread of the zeros of the spectrogram of white noise, it has led to fruitful theoretical developments combining probability theory, complex analysis and signal processing. In this vein, the present work proposes a characterization of the zeros of the Stockwell Transform of white noise, which consists in an hybrid time--frequency multiresolution representation. First of all, an analytic version of the Stockwell Transform is designed. Then, analyticity is leveraged to establish a connection with the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function, whose zero set is invariant under the isometries of the Poincar\'e disk. Finally, the theoretical spatial statistics of the zeros of the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function and the empirical statistics of the zeros the Analytic Stockwell Transform of white noise are compared through intensive Monte Carlo simulations, supporting the established connection. A publicly available documented Python toolbox accompanies this work.</description>

      <title>Extended Set Difference : Inverse Operation of Minkowski Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the extended set difference, a generalization of the Hukuhara and generalized Hukuhara differences, defined for compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The proposed difference guarantees existence for any pair of such sets, offering a broader framework for set arithmetic. The difference may not be necessarily unique, but we offer a bound on the variety of solutions. The definition of the extended set difference is formulated through an optimization problem, which provides a constructive approach to its computation. The paper explores the properties of this new difference, including its stability under orthogonal transformations and its robustness to perturbations of the input sets. We propose a method to compute this difference through a formulated linear optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Anti-Vietoris--Rips metric thickenings and Borsuk graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $X$ a metric space and $r\ge 0$, the anti-Vietoris-Rips metric thickening $\mathrm{AVR^m}(X;r)$ is the space of all finitely supported probability measures on $X$ whose support has spread at least $r$, equipped with an optimal transport topology. We study the anti-Vietoris-Rips metric thickenings of spheres. We have a homeomorphism $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;r) \cong S^n$ for $r &gt; \pi$, a homotopy equivalence $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;r) \simeq \mathbb{RP}^{n}$ for $\frac{2\pi}{3} &lt; r \le \pi$, and contractibility $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;r) \simeq *$ for $r=0$. For an $n$-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold $M$, we show that the covering dimension of $\mathrm{AVR^m}(M;r)$ is at most $(n+1)p-1$, where $p$ is the packing number of $M$ at scale $r$. Hence the $k$-dimensional \v{C}ech cohomology of $\mathrm{AVR^m}(M;r)$ vanishes in all dimensions $k\geq (n+1)p$. We prove more about the topology of $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;\frac{2\pi}{3})$, which has vanishing cohomology in dimensions $2n+2$ and higher. We explore connections to chromatic numbers of Borsuk graphs, and in particular we prove that for $k&gt;n$, no graph homomorphism $\mathrm{Bor}(S^k;r) \to \mathrm{Bor}(S^n;\alpha)$ exists when $\alpha &gt; \frac{2\pi}{3}$.</description>
