      <title>Coevolutionary game dynamics with localized environmental resource feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic environments shape diverse dynamics in evolutionary game systems. We introduce spatial heterogeneity of resources into the Prisoner's Dilemma Game model to explore the co-evolution of individuals' strategies and environmental resources. The adequacy of resources significantly affects the survival competitiveness of surrounding individuals. Feedback between individuals' strategies and the resources they can use leads to the dynamic of the "oscillatory tragedy of the commons". Our findings indicate that when the influence of individuals' strategies on the update rate of resources is significantly high, individuals can form sustained spatial clustered patterns. These sustained patterns can directly trigger a transition in the system from the persistent periodic oscillating state to an equilibrium state. These findings align with observed phenomena in real ecosystems, where organisms organize their spatial structures to maintain system stability. We discuss critical phenomena in detail, demonstrating that the aforementioned phase transition is robust across various system parameters including: the strength of cooperators in restoring the environment, the initial distributions of cooperators, and noise.</description>

      <title>Accounting for reporting delays in real-time phylodynamic analyses with preferential sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that fast and accurate analysis of continually collected infectious disease surveillance data is crucial for situational awareness and policy making. Coalescent-based phylodynamic analysis can use genetic sequences of a pathogen to estimate changes in its effective population size, a measure of genetic diversity. These changes in effective population size can be connected to the changes in the number of infections in the population of interest under certain conditions. Phylodynamics is an important set of tools because its methods are often resilient to the ascertainment biases present in traditional surveillance data (e.g., preferentially testing symptomatic individuals). Unfortunately, it takes weeks or months to sequence and deposit the sampled pathogen genetic sequences into a database, making them available for such analyses. These reporting delays severely decrease precision of phylodynamic methods closer to present time, and for some models can lead to extreme biases. Here we present a method that affords reliable estimation of the effective population size trajectory closer to the time of data collection, allowing for policy decisions to be based on more recent data. Our work uses readily available historic times between sampling and sequencing for a population of interest, and incorporates this information into the sampling model to mitigate the effects of reporting delay in real-time analyses. We illustrate our methodology on simulated data and on SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in the state of Washington in 2021.</description>

      <title>Spatial Structure Supports Diversity in Prebiotic Autocatalytic Chemical Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autocatalysis is thought to have played an important role in the earliest stages of the origin of life. An autocatalytic cycle (AC) is a set of reactions that results in stoichiometric increase in its constituent chemicals. When the reactions of multiple interacting ACs are active in a region of space, they can have interactions analogous to those between species in biological ecosystems. Prior studies of autocatalytic chemical ecosystems (ACEs) have suggested avenues for accumulating complexity, such as ecological succession, as well as obstacles such as competitive exclusion. We extend this ecological framework to investigate the effects of surface adsorption, desorption, and diffusion on ACE ecology. Simulating ACEs as particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion systems in spatial environments-including open, two-dimensional reaction-diffusion systems and adsorptive mineral surfaces-we demonstrate that spatial structure can enhance ACE diversity by i) permitting otherwise mutually exclusive ACs to coexist and ii) subjecting new AC traits to selection.</description>
