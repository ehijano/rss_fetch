      <title>Exploiting Dependency and Parallelism: Real-Time Scheduling and Analysis for GPU Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has become increasingly essential across a growing number of safety-critical application domains. Applying a GPU is indispensable for parallel computing; however, the complex data dependencies and resource contention across kernels within a GPU task may unpredictably delay its execution time. To address these problems, this paper presents a scheduling and analysis method for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-structured GPU tasks. Given a DAG representation, the proposed scheduling scales the kernel-level parallelism and establishes inter-kernel dependencies to provide a reduced and predictable DAG response time. The corresponding timing analysis yields a safe yet nonpessimistic makespan bound without any assumption on kernel priorities. The proposed method is implemented using the standard CUDA API, requiring no additional software or hardware support. Experimental results under synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces the worst-case makespan and measured task execution time compared to the existing methods up to 32.8% and 21.3%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Right to History: A Sovereignty Kernel for Verifiable AI Agent Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents increasingly act on behalf of humans, yet no existing system provides a tamper-evident, independently verifiable record of what they did. As regulations such as the EU AI Act begin mandating automatic logging for high-risk AI systems, this gap carries concrete consequences -- especially for agents running on personal hardware, where no centralized provider controls the log. Extending Floridi's informational rights framework from data about individuals to actions performed on their behalf, this paper proposes the Right to History: the principle that individuals are entitled to a complete, verifiable record of every AI agent action on their own hardware. The paper formalizes this principle through five system invariants with structured proof sketches, and implements it in PunkGo, a Rust sovereignty kernel that unifies RFC 6962 Merkle tree audit logs, capability-based isolation, energy-budget governance, and a human-approval mechanism. Adversarial testing confirms all five invariants hold. Performance evaluation shows sub-1.3 ms median action latency, ~400 actions/sec throughput, and 448-byte Merkle inclusion proofs at 10,000 log entries.</description>
