      <title>Drug Release Modeling using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of drug release is essential for designing and developing controlled-release systems. Classical models (Fick, Higuchi, Peppas) rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy in complex geometries and release mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE &lt;0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE &lt;0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise. By combining physical laws with experimental data, the proposed framework yields highly accurate long-term release predictions from short-term measurements, offering a practical route for accelerated characterization and more efficient early-stage drug release system formulation.</description>

      <title>Decomposed Direct Preference Optimization for Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved promising results for Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD). Nevertheless, high-quality protein subpocket and ligand data are relatively scarce, which hinders the models' generation capabilities. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a pivotal tool for aligning generative models with human preferences. In this paper, we propose DecompDPO, a structure-based optimization method aligns diffusion models with pharmaceutical needs using multi-granularity preference pairs. DecompDPO introduces decomposition into the optimization objectives and obtains preference pairs at the molecule or decomposed substructure level based on each objective's decomposability. Additionally, DecompDPO introduces a physics-informed energy term to ensure reasonable molecular conformations in the optimization results. Notably, DecompDPO can be effectively used for two main purposes: (1) fine-tuning pretrained diffusion models for molecule generation across various protein families, and (2) molecular optimization given a specific protein subpocket after generation. Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that DecompDPO significantly improves model performance, achieving up to 95.2% Med. High Affinity and a 36.2% success rate for molecule generation, and 100% Med. High Affinity and a 52.1% success rate for molecular optimization.

      <title>DISPROTBENCH: Uncovering the Functional Limits of Protein Structure Prediction Models in Intrinsically Disordered Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) play central roles in cellular function, yet remain poorly evaluated by existing protein structure prediction benchmarks. Current evaluations largely focus on well-folded domains, overlooking three fundamental challenges in realistic biological settings: the structural complexity of proteins, the resulting low availability of reliable ground truth, and prediction uncertainty that can propagate into high-risk downstream failures, such as in drug discovery, protein-protein interaction modeling, and functional annotation. We present DisProtBench, an IDR-centric benchmark that explicitly incorporates prediction uncertainty into the evaluation of protein structure prediction models (PSPMs). To address structural complexity and ground-truth scarcity, we curate and unify a large-scale, multi-modal dataset spanning disease-relevant IDRs, GPCR-ligand interactions, and multimeric protein complexes. To assess predictive uncertainty, we introduce Functional Uncertainty Sensitivity (FUS), a novel prediction uncertainty-stratified metric that quantifies downstream task performance under prediction uncertainty. Using this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art PSPMs and reveal clear, task-dependent failure modes. Protein-protein interaction prediction degrades sharply in IDRs, while structure-based drug discovery remains comparatively robust. These effects are largely invisible to standard global accuracy metrics, which overestimate functional reliability under prediction uncertainty. We have open-sourced our benchmark and the codebase at https://github.com/Susan571/DisProtBench.</description>

      <title>CPTCs Drive Somatic-Visceral Communication via the Wnt Axis in Somatic Mechanotherapy: A Single-Cell Deep Learning Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Somatic mechanical stimulation (e.g., acupuncture) exerts systemic immunomodulatory effects, yet the cellular bridge translating peripheral physical force into visceral repair remains elusive. Here, employing a custom interpretable deep learning framework (CARSS) on single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identify CD34$^{+}$PDGFR$\alpha$$^{+}$ telocytes (CPTCs) as the primary mechanosensors in both fascia and colon during bacterial colitis. We show that somatic mechanotherapy triggers an AP-1/Hsp70-dependent transcriptional program in fascial CPTCs, inducing systemic Wnt elevation, which elicits a "transcriptional resonance" in colonic CPTCs, reprogramming their communication network from an inflammatory amplifier to a Wnt-driven regenerative hub. Mechanistically, this axis activates epithelial $\beta$-catenin/Myc signaling, suppressing apoptosis and restoring barrier integrity independent of immune cells. Our findings define a CPTC-Driven Mechano-Resonance Axis, where CPTCs serve as synchronized relay stations that convert local mechanical cues into systemic regenerative microenvironments.</description>

      <title>General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate ligands that bind strongly and specifically to target protein pockets. Recent diffusion models have advanced SBDD by capturing the distributions of atomic positions and types, yet they often underemphasize binding affinity control during generation. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{\textnormal{\textbf{BADGER}}}, a general \textbf{binding-affinity guidance framework for diffusion models in SBDD}. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} }incorporates binding affinity awareness through two complementary strategies: (1) \textit{classifier guidance}, which applies gradient-based affinity signals during sampling in a plug-and-play fashion, and (2) \textit{classifier-free guidance}, which integrates affinity conditioning directly into diffusion model training. Together, these approaches enable controllable ligand generation guided by binding affinity. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} } can be added to any diffusion model and achieves up to a \textbf{60\% improvement in ligand--protein binding affinity} of sampled molecules over prior methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework to \textbf{multi-constraint diffusion guidance}, jointly optimizing for binding affinity, drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility (SA) to design realistic and synthesizable drug candidates.</description>

      <title>MolLangBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Language-Prompted Molecular Structure Recognition, Editing, and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks. We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality, unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations: the strongest model (GPT-5) achieves $86.2\%$ and $85.5\%$ accuracy on recognition and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even worse on the generation task, reaching only $43.0\%$ accuracy. These results highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for chemical applications.The dataset and code can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChemFM/MolLangBench and https://github.com/TheLuoFengLab/MolLangBench, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Dataset for Molecular Structure-Language Description via a Rule-Regularized Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular function is largely determined by structure. Accurately aligning molecular structure with natural language is therefore essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to reason about downstream chemical tasks. However, the substantial cost of human annotation makes it infeasible to construct large-scale, high-quality datasets of structure-grounded descriptions. In this work, we propose a fully automated annotation framework for generating precise molecular structure descriptions at scale. Our approach builds upon and extends a rule-based chemical nomenclature parser to interpret IUPAC names and construct enriched, structured XML metadata that explicitly encodes molecular structure. This metadata is then used to guide LLMs in producing accurate natural-language descriptions. Using this framework, we curate a large-scale dataset of approximately $163$k molecule-description pairs. A rigorous validation protocol combining LLM-based and expert human evaluation on a subset of $2,000$ molecules demonstrates a high description precision of $98.6\%$. The resulting dataset provides a reliable foundation for future molecule-language alignment, and the proposed annotation method is readily extensible to larger datasets and broader chemical tasks that rely on structural descriptions.</description>
