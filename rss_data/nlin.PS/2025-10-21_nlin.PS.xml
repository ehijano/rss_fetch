      <title>Multi-Soliton Propagation and Interaction in $\Lambda$-Type EIT Media: An Integrable Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is well known as a quantum optical phenomenon that permits a normally opaque medium to become transparent due to the quantum interference between transition pathways. This work addresses multi-soliton dynamics in an EIT system modeled by the integrable Maxwell-Bloch (MB) equations for a three-level $\Lambda $-type atomic configuration. By employing a generalized gauge transformation, we systematically construct explicit N-soliton solutions from the corresponding Lax pair. Explicit forms of one-, two-, three-, and four-soliton solutions are derived and analyzed. The resulting pulse structures reveal various nonlinear phenomena, such as temporal asymmetry, energy trapping, and soliton interactions. They also highlight coherent propagation, elastic collisions, and partial storage of pulses, which have potential implications for the design of quantum memory, slow light and photonic data transport in EIT media. In addition, the conservation of fundamental physical quantities, such as the excitation norm and Hamiltonian, is used to provide direct evidence of the integrability and stability of the constructed soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of additive and parametric pinning control protocols for systems of weakly coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of nonlinear systems on networks is a paramount task in control theory, in particular the control of synchronization, given its vast applicability. In this work, we focus on pinning control and we examine two different approaches: the first, more common in engineering applications, where the control is implemented through an external input (additive pinning); the other, where the parameters of the pinned nodes are varied (parametric pinning). By means of the phase reduction technique, we show that the two pinning approaches are equivalent for weakly coupled systems exhibiting periodic oscillatory behaviors. Through numerical simulations, we validate the claim for a system of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators. Our results pave the way for further applications of pinning control in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Ambush strategy impacts species predominance and coexistence in rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the adaptive Ambush strategy in cyclic models following the rules of the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. In our model, individuals of one species possess cognitive abilities to perceive environmental cues and assess the local density of the species they dominate in the spatial competition for natural resources. Based on this assessment, they either initiate a direct attack or, if the local concentration of target individuals does not justify the risk, reposition strategically to prepare an ambush. To quantify the evolutionary consequences of these behavioural strategies, we perform stochastic simulations, analysing emergent spatial patterns and the dependence of species densities on the threshold used by individuals to decide between immediate attack or anticipation. Our findings reveal that, despite being designed to enhance efficiency, cognitive strategies can reduce the abundance of the species due to the constraints of cyclic dominance. We identify an optimal decision threshold: attacking only when the local density of target individuals exceeds 15% provides the best balance between selection risk and long-term persistence. Furthermore, the Ambush strategy benefits low-mobility organisms, increasing coexistence probabilities by up to 53%. These results deepen the understanding of adaptive decision-making in spatial ecology, linking cognitive complexity to ecosystem resilience and extinction risk.</description>

      <title>Visual-Neural-Inspired Image Inpainting for Specific Objects-of-Interest Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12808v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional image inpainting techniques typically process entire images, which often leads to computational inefficiency and susceptibility to information redundancy, particularly in occluded or cluttered scenes. Inspired by cortical processing mechanisms, this study introduces a novel framework termed "Specific Object-of-Interest Imaging" (SIOI) to overcome these limitations. The proposed approach first extracts and encodes object-level representations from complex scenes, producing structural and semantic priors that can be seamlessly integrated into existing inpainting pipelines. Extensive evaluations on dedicated object datasets--Teapot, Elephant, Giraffe, and Zebra--demonstrate that models incorporating SIOI consistently outperform those without it across key metrics including SSIM, PSNR, MAE, and LPIPS. The framework also exhibits strong robustness under challenging conditions such as low illumination, high noise, multiple object occlusions, and motion blur. Furthermore, theoretical analysis grounded in cognitive neuroscience reveals meaningful connections between the "object-first" perceptual mechanism and dynamic feature modulation in visual cortical areas (V1-V4). By significantly enhancing object consistency and semantic coherence across diverse inpainting models, this work not only advances efficient and target-aware image restoration but also fosters interdisciplinary convergence between brain-inspired computation and cutting-edge inpainting technologies.</description>

      <title>Dark photon dark matter from flattened axion potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons can be resonantly produced in the early universe via their coupling to an oscillating axion field. However, this mechanism typically requires large axion--dark photon couplings or some degree of fine-tuning. In this work, we present a new scenario in which efficient dark photon production arises from axion potentials that are shallower than quadratic at large field values. For moderately large initial misalignment angles, the oscillation of the axion field can trigger either efficient dark photon production or strong axion self-resonance via parametric resonance. When self-resonance dominates and disrupts the field's homogeneity, we show that oscillons -- localized, oscillating axion field configurations -- naturally form and can sustain continued dark photon production, provided the coupling is $\gtrsim \mathcal O(1)$. For dark photon mass up to three orders of magnitude below the axion mass, the produced dark photons can account for a significant fraction of the present-day dark matter. We support this scenario with numerical lattice simulations of a benchmark model. Our results further motivate experimental searches for ultralight dark photon dark matter. The simulation code is publicly available at https://github.com/hongyi18/AxionDarkPhotonSimulator.</description>

      <title>Stable High-Order Vortices in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present contribution explores phase transitions that occur in the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) under the action of gradient
  magnetic fields. By solving the corresponding linearized system in an exact fashion, we identify the
  conditions under which the GS phase transitions occur, thus transforming excited states into GS.
  The study of the full nonlinear system, including both density-density and spin-spin interactions,
  is numerically analyzed. For the case of repulsive spin-spin interactions, the results resemble the
  linear case, while attractive spin-spin interactions lead to the formation of mixed-states near the GS
  phase-transition points. Additionally, higher-order vortex solitons are found to be stable even in
  the nonlinear regime. These findings demonstrate that arbitrary winding numbers can be achieved
  as corresponding to stable GS and thus contributing to the understanding of topological properties
  in SOC BECs.</description>
