      <title>Decoupling spin relaxation and chemical kinetics in radical pair magnetism: A master equation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A leading theory for the biological effects of low-intensity magnetic fields is the spin-chemical Radical Pair Mechanism. This mechanism is best described by the master equation for the density matrix of an open quantum system, which includes terms for Hamiltonian evolution, thermal spin relaxation, and chemical kinetics. In this study, we have found a solution to this equation for a simplified radical pair model and shown that a significant magnetic effect occurs when the following condition is met: $\gamma H \tau \gtrsim 1 + \kappa \tau$, where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron, $H$ is the magnetic field strength, $\tau$ is the relaxation time, and $\kappa$ is the rate of chemical kinetics.</description>

      <title>Uncovering flow and deformation regimes in the coupled fluid-solid vestibular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we showcase how flow obstruction by a deformable object can lead to symmetry breaking in curved domains subject to angular acceleration. Our analysis is motivated by the deflection of the cupula, a soft tissue located in the inner ear that is used to perceive rotational motion as part of the vestibular system. The cupula is understood to block the rotation-induced flow in a toroidal region with the flow-induced deformation of the cupula used by the brain to infer motion. By asymptotically solving the governing equations for this flow, we characterise regimes for which the sensory system is sensitive to either angular velocity or angular acceleration. Moreover, we show the fluid flow is not symmetric in the latter case. Finally, we extend our analysis of symmetry breaking to understand the formation of vortical flow in cavernous regions within channels. We discuss the implications of our results for the sensing of rotation by mammals.</description>

      <title>Mass Balance Approximation of Unfolding Improves Potential-Like Methods for Protein Stability Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of protein stability changes following single-point mutations plays a pivotal role in computational biology, particularly in areas like drug discovery, enzyme reengineering, and genetic disease analysis. Although deep-learning strategies have pushed the field forward, their use in standard workflows remains limited due to resource demands. Conversely, potential-like methods are fast, intuitive, and efficient. Yet, these typically estimate Gibbs free energy shifts without considering the free-energy variations in the unfolded protein state, an omission that may breach mass balance and diminish accuracy. This study shows that incorporating a mass-balance correction (MBC) to account for the unfolded state significantly enhances these methods. While many machine learning models partially model this balance, our analysis suggests that a refined representation of the unfolded state may improve the predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Activated solids: Spontaneous deformations, non-affine fluctuations, softening, and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous deformations in activated solids by analyzing crystal deformations through non-affine fluctuations. A scaling law for non-affinity is derived, showing it scales quadratically with activity and inversely with density. At high activity, the non-affine parameter diverges, signaling defect proliferation and melting to a hexatic phase. This softening is marked by reduced shear modulus, solid order, and hexatic order. At a higher activity, the hexatic melts to a fluid. We propose locally tuned activity to control non-affinity, demonstrated through numerical simulations. Our predictions are testable in active colloids performing persistent random motion.</description>

      <title>Cerebral blood flow monitoring using a deep learning implementation of the two-layer DCS analytical model with a 512 512 SPAD array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) analyzes the autocorrelation function of photons scattered by red blood cells, enabling non-invasive, continuous measurement of deep tissue blood flow at the bedside. Multi-layer DCS models (two- and three-layer) enhance cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) sensitivity and mitigate interference from extracerebral tissues. However, these models require multiple predefined parameters and are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time bedside monitoring. To address this challenge, we integrate a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array with a deep learning (DL)-based approach trained on data generated by the two-layer analytical model. This method bypasses traditional model fitting, enabling real-time CBFi monitoring while minimizing superficial tissue contamination. We first validate our approach using Monte Carlo-simulated test datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy in relative CBFi estimation (5.8% error vs. 19.1% for conventional fitting) and enhanced CBFi sensitivity (87.1% vs. 55.4%). Additionally, our method effectively isolates shallow blood flow changes and 750-fold faster than single-exponential fitting in a realistic scenario. We further evaluate the system in a healthy adult, achieving real-time CBFi monitoring and pulsatile waveform recovery during a brain activity test using a 512 512 SPAD array sensor. These results highlight the potential of our approach for real-time brain activity monitoring.</description>

      <title>Fitting Coarse-Grained Models to Macroscopic Experimental Data via Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing physics-based models for molecular simulation requires fitting many unknown parameters to diverse experimental datasets. Traditionally, this process is piecemeal and difficult to reproduce, leading to a fragmented landscape of models. Here, we establish a systematic, extensible framework for fitting coarse-grained molecular models to macroscopic experimental data by leveraging recently developed methods for computing low-variance gradient estimates with automatic differentiation. Using a widely validated DNA force field as an exemplar, we develop methods for optimizing structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties across a range of simulation techniques, including enhanced sampling and external forcing, spanning micro- and millisecond timescales. We highlight how gradients enable efficient sensitivity analyses that yield physical insight. We then demonstrate the broad applicability of these techniques by optimizing diverse biomolecular systems, including RNA and DNA-protein hybrid models. We show how conflict-free gradient methods from multi-task learning can be adapted to impose multiple constraints simultaneously without compromising accuracy. This approach provides a foundation for transparent, reproducible, community-driven force field development, accelerating progress in molecular modeling.</description>

      <title>Retinotopic Mechanics derived using classical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11632v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a cell$'$s receptive field is a bedrock in systems neuroscience, and the classical static description of the receptive field has had enormous success in explaining the fundamental mechanisms underlying visual processing. Borne out by the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual sensitivity to probe stimuli in primates, I build on top of this static account with the introduction of a new computational field of research, retinotopic mechanics. At its core, retinotopic mechanics assumes that during active sensing receptive fields are not static but can shift beyond their classical extent. Specifically, the canonical computations and the neural architecture that supports these computations are inherently mediated by a neurobiologically inspired force field (e.g.,$R_s\propto \sim 1 /\Delta M$). For example, when the retina is displaced because of a saccadic eye movement from one point in space to another, cells across retinotopic brain areas are tasked with discounting the retinal disruptions such active surveillance inherently introduces. This neural phenomenon is known as spatial constancy. Using retinotopic mechanics, I propose that to achieve spatial constancy or any active visually mediated task, retinotopic cells, namely their receptive fields, are constrained by eccentricity dependent elastic fields. I propose that elastic fields are self-generated by the visual system and allow receptive fields the ability to predictively shift beyond their classical extent to future post-saccadic location such that neural sensitivity which would otherwise support intermediate eccentric locations likely to contain retinal disruptions is transiently blunted.</description>
