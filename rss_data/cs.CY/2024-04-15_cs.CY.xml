      <title>Toxic Synergy Between Hate Speech and Fake News Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hate speech on social media is a pressing concern. Understanding the factors associated with hate speech may help mitigate it. Here we explore the association between hate speech and exposure to fake news by studying the correlation between exposure to news from low-credibility sources through following connections and the use of hate speech on Twitter. Using news source credibility labels and a dataset of posts with hate speech targeting various populations, we find that hate speakers are exposed to lower percentages of posts linking to credible news sources. When taking the target population into account, we find that this association is mainly driven by anti-semitic and anti-Muslim content. We also observe that hate speakers are more likely to be exposed to low-credibility news with low popularity. Finally, while hate speech is associated with low-credibility news from partisan sources, we find that those sources tend to skew to the political left for antisemitic content and to the political right for hate speech targeting Muslim and Latino populations. Our results suggest that mitigating fake news and hate speech may have synergistic effects.</description>

      <title>Non-discrimination law in Europe: a primer. Introducing European non-discrimination law to non-lawyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief paper provides an introduction to non-discrimination law in Europe. It answers the questions: What are the key characteristics of non-discrimination law in Europe, and how do the different statutes relate to one another? Our main target group is computer scientists and users of artificial intelligence (AI) interested in an introduction to non-discrimination law in Europe. Notably, non-discrimination law in Europe differs significantly from non-discrimination law in other countries, such as the US. We aim to describe the law in such a way that non-lawyers and non-European lawyers can easily grasp its contents and challenges. The paper shows that the human right to non-discrimination, to some extent, protects individuals against private actors, such as companies. We introduce the EU-wide non-discrimination rules which are included in a number of EU directives, and also explain the difference between direct and indirect discrimination. Significantly, an organization can be fined for indirect discrimination even if the company, or its AI system, discriminated by accident. The last section broadens the horizon to include bias-relevant law and cases from the GDPR, the EU AI Act, and related statutes. Finally, we give reading tips for those inclined to learn more about non-discrimination law in Europe.</description>

      <title>Scarce Resource Allocations That Rely On Machine Learning Should Be Randomized</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to traditional deterministic notions of algorithmic fairness, this paper argues that fairly allocating scarce resources using machine learning often requires randomness. We address why, when, and how to randomize by proposing stochastic procedures that more adequately account for all of the claims that individuals have to allocations of social goods or opportunities.</description>

      <title>The Impact of School and Family Networks on COVID-19 Infections Among Dutch Students: A Study Using Population-Level Registry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of different social interactions is key to improving epidemic models. Here, we use extensive registry data -- including PCR test results and population-level networks -- to investigate the impact of school, family, and other social contacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands (June 2020--October 2021). We isolate and compare different contexts of potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission by matching pairs of students based on their attendance at the same or different primary school (in 2020) and secondary school (in 2021) and their geographic proximity. We then calculated the probability of temporally associated infections -- i.e. the probability of both students testing positive within a 14-day period.
  Our results highlight the relative importance of household and family transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to school settings. The probability of temporally associated infections for siblings and parent-child pairs living in the same household was 22.6--23.2\%, and 4.7--7.9\% for family members living in different household. In contrast, the probability of temporally associated infections was 0.52\% for pairs of students living nearby but not attending the same primary or secondary school, 0.66\% for pairs attending different secondary schools but having attended the same primary school, and 1.65\% for pairs attending the same secondary school. Finally, we used multilevel regression analyses to examine how individual, school, and geographic factors contribute to transmission risk. We found that the largest differences in transmission probabilities were due to unobserved individual (60\%) and school-level (34\%) factors. Only a small proportion (3\%) could be attributed to geographic proximity of students or to school size, denomination, or the median income of the school area.</description>

      <title>Uncertain Boundaries: Multidisciplinary Approaches to Copyright Issues in Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of generative artificial intelligence (AI), the increasingly pertinent issue of copyright infringement arises as AI advances to generate content from scraped copyrighted data, prompting questions about ownership and protection that impact professionals across various careers. With this in mind, this survey provides an extensive examination of copyright infringement as it pertains to generative AI, aiming to stay abreast of the latest developments and open problems. Specifically, it will first outline methods of detecting copyright infringement in mediums such as text, image, and video. Next, it will delve an exploration of existing techniques aimed at safeguarding copyrighted works from generative models. Furthermore, this survey will discuss resources and tools for users to evaluate copyright violations. Finally, insights into ongoing regulations and proposals for AI will be explored and compared. Through combining these disciplines, the implications of AI-driven content and copyright are thoroughly illustrated and brought into question.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fairness and Performance in Machine Learning Models: A Multi-Task Learning Approach with Monte-Carlo Dropout and Pareto Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the need for generalizable bias mitigation techniques in machine learning due to the growing concerns of fairness and discrimination in data-driven decision-making procedures across a range of industries. While many existing methods for mitigating bias in machine learning have succeeded in specific cases, they often lack generalizability and cannot be easily applied to different data types or models. Additionally, the trade-off between accuracy and fairness remains a fundamental tension in the field. To address these issues, we propose a bias mitigation method based on multi-task learning, utilizing the concept of Monte-Carlo dropout and Pareto optimality from multi-objective optimization. This method optimizes accuracy and fairness while improving the model's explainability without using sensitive information. We test this method on three datasets from different domains and show how it can deliver the most desired trade-off between model fairness and performance. This allows for tuning in specific domains where one metric may be more important than another. With the framework we introduce in this paper, we aim to enhance the fairness-performance trade-off and offer a solution to bias mitigation methods' generalizability issues in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Ranked Choice Voting And Condorcet Failure in the Alaska 2022 Special Election: How Might Other Voting Systems Compare?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The August 2022 special election for the U.S. House of Representatives in Alaska featured three main candidates and was conducted by the single-winner ranked choice voting system known as "Instant Runoff Voting." The results of this election displayed a well-known but relatively rare phenomenon known as "Condorcet failure:" Nick Begich was eliminated in the first round despite being more broadly acceptable to the electorate than either of the other two candidates. More specifically, Begich was the "Condorcet winner" of this election: Based on the Cast Vote Record, he would have defeated each of the other two candidates in head-to-head contests, but he was eliminated in the first round of ballot counting due to receiving the fewest first-place votes.
  The purpose of this paper is to use the data in the Cast Vote Record to explore the range of likely outcomes if this election had been conducted under two alternative voting systems: Approval Voting and STAR ("Score Then Automatic Runoff") Voting. We find that under the best assumptions available about voter behavior, it is likely -- but not at all certain -- that Peltola would still have won the election under Approval Voting, while Begich would almost certainly have won under STAR Voting.</description>

      <title>Gauging Public Acceptance of Conditionally Automated Vehicles in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public acceptance of conditionally automated vehicles is a crucial step in the realization of smart cities. Prior research in Europe has shown that the factors of hedonic motivation, social influence, and performance expectancy, in decreasing order of importance, influence acceptance. Moreover, a generally positive acceptance of the technology was reported. However, there is a lack of information regarding the public acceptance of conditionally automated vehicles in the United States. In this study, we carried out a web-based experiment where participants were provided information regarding the technology and then completed a questionnaire on their perceptions. The collected data was analyzed using PLS-SEM to examine the factors that may lead to public acceptance of the technology in the United States. Our findings showed that social influence, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions determine conditionally automated vehicle acceptance. Additionally, certain factors were found to influence the perception of how useful the technology is, the effort required to use it, and the facilitating conditions for its use. By integrating the insights gained from this study, stakeholders can better facilitate the adoption of autonomous vehicle technology, contributing to safer, more efficient, and user-friendly transportation systems in the future that help realize the vision of the smart city.</description>

      <title>Towards Measuring and Modeling "Culture" in LLMs: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a survey of 39 recent papers that aim to study cultural representation and inclusion in large language models. We observe that none of the studies define "culture," which is a complex, multifaceted concept; instead, they probe the models on some specially designed datasets which represent certain aspects of "culture." We call these aspects the proxies of cultures, and organize them across three dimensions of demographic, semantic and linguistic-cultural interaction proxies. We also categorize the probing methods employed. Our analysis indicates that only certain aspects of "culture," such as values and objectives, have been studied, leaving several other interesting and important facets, especially the multitude of semantic domains (Thompson et al., 2020) and aboutness (Hershcovich et al., 2022), unexplored. Two other crucial gaps are the lack of robustness and situatedness of the current methods. Based on these observations, we provide several recommendations for a holistic and practically useful research agenda for furthering cultural inclusion in LLMs and LLM-based applications.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Approach for Ex-post Assessment of Community Risk and Resilience Based on Coupled Human-infrastructure Systems Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a limitation in the literature of data-driven analyses for the ex-post evaluation of community risk and resilience, particularly using features related to the performance of coupled human-infrastructure systems. To address this gap, in this study we created a machine learning-based method for the ex-post assessment of community risk and resilience and their interplay based on features related to the coupled human-infrastructure systems performance. Utilizing feature groups related to population protective actions, infrastructure/building performance features, and recovery features, we examined the risk and resilience performance of communities in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. These features related to the coupled human-infrastructure systems performance were processed using the K-means clustering method to classify census block groups into four distinct clusters then, based on feature analysis, these clusters were labeled and designated into four quadrants of risk-resilience archetypes. Finally, we analyzed the disparities in risk-resilience status of spatial areas across different clusters as well as different income groups. The findings unveil the risk-resilience status of spatial areas shaped by their coupled human-infrastructure systems performance and their interactions. The results also inform about features that contribute to high resilience in high-risk areas. For example, the results indicate that in high-risk areas, evacuation rates contributed to a greater resilience, while in low-risk areas, preparedness contributed to greater resilience.</description>

      <title>Chapter: Vulnerability of Quantum Information Systems to Collective Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.08873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly specialist terms `quantum computing' and `quantum information', together with the broader term `quantum technologies', now appear regularly in the mainstream media. While this is undoubtedly highly exciting for physicists and investors alike, a key question for society concerns such systems' vulnerabilities -- and in particular, their vulnerability to collective manipulation. Here we present and discuss a new form of vulnerability in such systems, that we have identified based on detailed many-body quantum mechanical calculations. The impact of this new vulnerability is that groups of adversaries can maximally disrupt these systems' global quantum state which will then jeopardize their quantum functionality. It will be almost impossible to detect these attacks since they do not change the Hamiltonian and the purity remains the same; they do not entail any real-time communication between the attackers; and they can last less than a second. We also argue that there can be an implicit amplification of such attacks because of the statistical character of modern non-state actor groups. A countermeasure could be to embed future quantum technologies within redundant classical networks. We purposely structure the discussion in this chapter so that the first sections are self-contained and can be read by non-specialists.</description>

      <title>Foundational Competencies and Responsibilities of a Research Software Engineer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The term Research Software Engineer, or RSE, emerged a little over 10 years ago as a way to represent individuals working in the research community but focusing on software development. The term has been widely adopted and there are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is. However, the roles of RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in. At one end of the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role. At the other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry. Most RSE roles inhabit the space between these two extremes. Therefore, providing a straightforward, comprehensive definition of what an RSE does and what experience, skills and competencies are required to become one is challenging. In this community paper we define the broad notion of what an RSE is, explore the different types of work they undertake, and define a list of fundamental competencies as well as values that define the general profile of an RSE. On this basis, we elaborate on the progression of these skills along different dimensions, looking at specific types of RSE roles, proposing recommendations for organisations, and giving examples of future specialisations. An appendix details how existing curricula fit into this framework.</description>

      <title>Systematically Assessing the Security Risks of AI/ML-enabled Connected Healthcare Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of machine-learning-enabled systems in the healthcare domain is on the rise. While the use of ML in healthcare has several benefits, it also expands the threat surface of medical systems. We show that the use of ML in medical systems, particularly connected systems that involve interfacing the ML engine with multiple peripheral devices, has security risks that might cause life-threatening damage to a patient's health in case of adversarial interventions. These new risks arise due to security vulnerabilities in the peripheral devices and communication channels. We present a case study where we demonstrate an attack on an ML-enabled blood glucose monitoring system by introducing adversarial data points during inference. We show that an adversary can achieve this by exploiting a known vulnerability in the Bluetooth communication channel connecting the glucose meter with the ML-enabled app. We further show that state-of-the-art risk assessment techniques are not adequate for identifying and assessing these new risks. Our study highlights the need for novel risk analysis methods for analyzing the security of AI-enabled connected health devices.</description>
