      <title>Vortex Solitons and Filamentation of Electromagnetic Beams in Relativistically Degenerate Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation and stability of electromagnetic vortex beams in relativistically de generate plasmas. We show that such plasmas support localized vortex solitons carrying orbital angular momentum and analyze their linear and nonlinear stability. Vortex solitons undergo az imuthal symmetry-breaking instabilities whose growth rates depend on beam power, propagation constant, and topological charge, with the dominant mode determining the number of filaments formed during breakup. We further demonstrate that vortex solitons act as nonlinear attractors with a finite basin of attraction, while the vortex core remains topologically protected, maintaining a strictly zero field intensity at the beam center throughout the evolution. The results persist across a broad range of degeneracy parameters and are relevant to hard X-ray radiation propagating in dense astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Learning collision operators from plasma phase space data using differentiable simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a methodology to infer collision operators from phase space data of plasma dynamics. Our approach combines a differentiable kinetic simulator, whose core component in this work is a differentiable Fokker-Planck solver, with a gradient-based optimisation method to learn the collisional operators that best describe the phase space dynamics. We test our method using data from two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations of spatially uniform thermal plasmas, and learn the collision operator that captures the self-consistent electromagnetic interaction between finite-size charged particles over a wide variety of simulation parameters. We demonstrate that the learned operators are more accurate than alternative estimates based on particle tracks, while making no prior assumptions about the relevant time-scales of the processes and significantly reducing memory requirements. We find that the retrieved operators, obtained in the non-relativistic regime, are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions derived for electrostatic scenarios. Our results show that differentiable simulators offer a powerful and computational efficient approach to infer novel operators for a wide rage of problems, such as electromagnetically dominated collisional dynamics and stochastic wave-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Study of circular cross-section plasmas in HL-2A tokamak: MHD equilibrium, stability and operational \b{eta} limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular cross-section plasma is the most basic form of tokamak plasma and the fundamental configuration for magnetic confinement fusion experiments. Based on the HL-2A limiter discharge experiments, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium and MHD instability of circular cross-section tokamak plasmas are investigated in this work. The results show that when q_0=0.95, the internal kink mode of m/n=1/1 is always unstable. The increase in plasma \b{eta} (the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) can lead to the appearance of external kink modes. The combination of axial safety factor q_0 and edge safety factor q_a determines the equilibrium configuration of the plasma and also affects the MHD stability of the equilibrium, but its growth rate is also related to the size of \b{eta}. Under the condition of q_a&gt;2 and q_0 slightly greater than 1, the internal kink mode and surface kink mode can be easily stabilized. However the plasma becomes unstable again and the instability intensity increases as q_0 continues to increase when q_0 exceeds 1. As the poloidal beta (\b{eta}_p) increases, the MHD instability develops, the equilibrium configuration of MHD elongates laterally, and the Shafranov displacement increases, which in turn has the effect on suppressing instability. Calculations have shown that the maximum \b{eta} value imposed by the ideal MHD mode in a plasma with free boundary in tokamak experiments is proportional to the normalized current I_N (I_N=I_p (MA)/a(m)B_0 (T)), and the achievable maximum beta \b{eta}(max) is calibrated to be 2.01I_N,i.e. \b{eta}(max)~2.01I_N. The operational \b{eta} limit of HL-2A circular cross-section plasma is approximately \b{eta}_N^c~2.0. Too high a value of q_0 is not conducive to MHD stability and leads the \b{eta} limit value to decrease. When q_0=1.3, we obtain a maximum value of \b{eta}_N of approximately 1.8.</description>

      <title>A new class of special functions arising in plasma linear susceptibility tensor calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate some fundamental properties of a peculiar class of special functions strictly related to Bessel, Anger and Weber functions, whose introduction was originally motivated by linear susceptibility tensor calculations in a hot, magnetised plasma. We show that these functions are solutions of an inhomogeneous Bessel ODE, with specified initial conditions and a distinct right-hand-side term fulfilling the Nielsen's requirement. Beside deriving recurrence relations and an alternative representation involving incomplete Anger-Weber functions, we show that these functions admit a simple series expansion in terms of Bessel functions of integer order, obtained by resorting to the Jacobi-Anger formula. In plasma applications this eventually leads to expressions involving infinite sums of products of Bessel functions, not particularly apt to numerical evaluation ought to their slow convergence rate when the particle's gyro-radius is larger than the wavelength. By exploiting the previously determined recurrence properties of the new class of functions we present a particularly simple derivation of the linear susceptibility tensor that enables to avoid this inconvenience.</description>

      <title>Towards precision quantitative measurement of radiation reaction within the classical radiation-dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation reaction (RR) is a fundamental yet incompletely validated process in laser-particle interactions, since it lacks quantitatively definitive experimental verifications, especially the transition from classical to quantum regime. Herein, we propose a novel experimental scenario for investigating radiation RR within the classical radiation-dominated regime (CRDR), via the collision of a high-intensity petawatt-class laser with a tens-of-MeV electron beam from a LINAC. This approach enables access to a distinct parameter regime wherein RR dominates electron dynamics while quantum effects remain modest. Numerical simulations demonstrate that three key observables exist for identifying the RR within this CRDR regime: (i) quantitative measurement of energy spectra to validate the quantum correction factor; (ii) control of the collision time delay with charge-counting to map intensity dependence of RR; and (iii) verification of large angle ($90^\circ$) photon emission under the recoil condition $2\gamma \gtrsim a_0$. These experimental measurements will establish the benchmarks for RR models spanning the classical-to-quantum regime, thereby providing critical insights into fundamental strong-field quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Generation and Enhancement of Persistent Nanoscale Magnetization in All-Dielectric Metasurfaces by Optically Injected and Localized Free Carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying dielectric metasurfaces supporting sharp optical resonances with a non-trivial electromagnetic field distribution represent a unique platform for realizing temporal interfaces for metasurface-guided waves (MGWs). Rapidly changing metasurface resonance enables frequency conversion and temporal scattering of a concurrently propagating MGW. Using analytical methods and electromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that localized free-carrier generation can be engineered to produce frequency-shifted, time-refracted, and reflected infrared MGWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such time interfaces can be utilized to generate large, highly localized quasistatic magnetic fields within the metasurfaces. The resulting nanoscale magnetization, supported by the residual circulating currents, persists after the departure of the time-scattered MGWs. We further demonstrate that the initial electromagnetic energy of the injected MGWs is partitioned between the time-reflected/refracted MGWs, residual motion of the free carriers, and a quasistatic magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed kinetic models based on general fishbone-like dispersion relations. Firstly, a general model for arbitrary magnetic configuration and ion orbit width is presented. Then, by disregarding ion orbit width and approximating the magnetic geometry as circular, we introduce a simplified model that fully incorporates circulating/trapped ion effects. Finally, by considering the limit of ions being well-circulating or deeply trapped, the results directly revert to those observed in earlier theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of a RF-RF hybrid plasma torch with argon at atmospheric pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13858v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report numerical results regarding the minimum sustaining coil excitation current for a RF-RF hybrid torch operating at two different frequencies. The first coil is excited at a high-frequency, while the second coil is set at a medium frequency. The filling gas is argon, at atmospheric pressure. We use the modeling software COMSOL Multiphysics to describe the evolution of key parameters when: (i) the distance between the two coils changes, (ii) the power of the high frequency coil changes. We discuss the radial temperature profiles, the axial velocities and the heat convected at the end of the medium-frequency coil. The latter is compared with the total heat conduction to the plasma confinement tube wall.</description>

      <title>Photon Accelerator in Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.</description>

      <title>Limitations of emittance and source size measurement of laser-accelerated electron beams using the pepper-pot mask method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pepper-pot method is a widely used technique, originally proposed for measuring the emittance of space-charge-dominated electron beams from radio-frequency photoinjectors. With recent advances in producing high-brightness electron beams via laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA), the method has also been applied to evaluate emittance in this new regime. Here, the limitations of this method for measuring the emittance of LWFA electron beams are investigated, particularly in parameter regimes where the true beam emittance is overestimated. Conducting an experiment at the JETi200 laser system, we measured an upper bound for the geometric beam emittance of $(26.2 \pm 7.3)$ $\mu$m mrad using the pepper-pot method. This result is consistent with GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation of the pepper-pot diagnostic, with an input beam-emittance parameter that matches both PIC simulations of the laser-plasma accelerator and an independent measurement using the transient optical grating method.</description>

      <title>Breakeven in Nuclear Fusion via Electron-Free Target</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion promises a nearly limitless energy source, but achieving breakeven-where fusion output exceeds input-requires extreme plasma conditions and complex confinement systems. Here we propose an alternative approach based on beam-target interactions, introducing a simple energy-based criterion that compares fusion energy generation with energy loss. By creating electron-free targets, stopping power is drastically reduced, enabling conditions where fusion energy surpasses beam energy deposition under practical scenarios. This approach offers a viable alternative pathway to fusion energy without high-temperature plasma confinement and warrants further experimental investigation.</description>
