      <title>Repeating Partial Tidal Encounters of Sun-like Stars Leading to their Complete Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars grazing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on bound orbits may produce periodic flares over many passages, known as repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here we present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of sun-like stars over multiple tidal encounters. The star is significantly restructured and becomes less concentrated as a result of mass loss and tidal heating. The vulnerability to mass loss depends sensitively on the stellar density structure, and the strong correlation between the fractional mass loss $\Delta M/M_*$ and the ratio of the central and average density $\rho_{\mathrm{c}}/\bar\rho$, which was initially derived in disruption simulations of main-sequence stars, also applies for stars strongly reshaped by tides. Over multiple orbits, the star loses progressively more mass in each encounter and is doomed to a complete disruption. Throughout its lifetime, the star may produce numerous weak flares (depending on the initial impact parameter), followed by a couple of luminous flares whose brightness increases exponentially. Flux-limited surveys are heavily biased towards the brightest flares, which may appear similar to the flare produced by the same star undergoing a full disruption on its first tidal encounter. This places new challenges on constraining the intrinsic TDE rates, which needs to take repeating TDEs into account. Other types of stars with different initial density structure (e.g., evolved stars with massive cores) follow distinct evolution tracks, which might explain the diversity of the long-term luminosity evolution seen in recently uncovered repeaters.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Observations of Sgr A*. II. 2019 July 21 and 26</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the final two days of a multiwavelength campaign of Sgr A* observing in the radio, submillimeter, infrared, and X-ray bands in July 2019. Sgr A* was remarkably active, showing multiple flaring events across the electromagnetic spectrum. We detect a transient $\sim35$-minute periodicity feature in Spitzer Space Telescope light curves on 21 July 2019. Time-delayed emission was detected in ALMA light curves, suggesting a hotspot within the accretion flow on a stable orbit. On the same night, we observe a decreased flux in the submillimeter light curve following an X-ray flare detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and model the feature with an adiabatically expanding synchrotron hotspot occulting the accretion flow. The event is produced by a plasma $0.55~R_{\text{S}}$ in radius with an electron spectrum $p=2.84$. It is threaded by a $\sim130$ Gauss magnetic field and expands at $0.6\%$ the speed of light. Finally, we reveal an unambiguous flare in the infrared, submillimeter, and radio, demonstrating that the variable emission is intrinsically linked. We jointly fit the radio and submillimeter light curves using an adiabatically expanding synchrotron hotspot and find it is produced by a plasma with an electron spectrum $p=0.59$, $187$ Gauss magnetic field, and radius $0.47~R_{\text{S}}$ that expands at $0.029c$. In both cases, the uncertainty in the appropriate lower and upper electron energy bounds may inflate the derived equipartition field strengths by a factor of 2 or more. Our results confirm that both synchrotron- and adiabatic-cooling processes are involved in the variable emission's evolution at submillimeter and infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>IXPE observation of PKS 2155-304 reveals the most highly polarized blazar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the X-ray polarization properties of the high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) blazar PKS 2155$-$304 based on observations with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We observed the source between Oct 27 and Nov 7, 2023. We also conducted an extensive contemporaneous multiwavelength (MW) campaign. We find that during the first half ($T_1$) of the IXPE pointing, the source exhibited the highest X-ray polarization degree detected for an HSP blazar thus far, (30.7$\pm$2.0)%, which dropped to (15.3$\pm$2.1)% during the second half ($T_2$). The X-ray polarization angle remained stable during the IXPE pointing at 129.4$^\circ$$\pm$1.8$^\circ$ and 125.4$^\circ$$\pm$3.9$^\circ$ during $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. Meanwhile, the optical polarization degree remained stable during the IXPE pointing, with average host-galaxy-corrected values of (4.3$\pm$0.7)% and (3.8$\pm$0.9)% during the $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. During the IXPE pointing, the optical polarization angle changed achromatically from $\sim$140$^\circ$ to $\sim$90$^\circ$ and back to $\sim$130$^\circ$. Despite several attempts, we only detected (99.7% conf.) the radio polarization once (during $T_2$, at 225.5 GHz): with degree (1.7$\pm$0.4)% and angle 112.5$^\circ$$\pm$5.5$^\circ$. The direction of the broad pc-scale jet is rather ambiguous and has been found to point to the east and south at different epochs; however, on larger scales (&gt; 1.5 pc) the jet points toward the southeast ($\sim$135$^\circ$), similar to all of the MW polarization angles. Moreover, the X-ray to optical polarization degree ratios of $\sim$7 and $\sim$4 during $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively, are similar to previous IXPE results for several HSP blazars. These findings, combined with the lack of correlation of temporal variability between the MW polarization properties, agree with an energy-stratified shock-acceleration scenario in HSP blazars.</description>

      <title>X-ray bright AGN in local dwarf galaxies: insights from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the heart of virtually every massive galaxy, it remains debated whether dwarf galaxies also commonly host SMBHs. Because low-mass galaxies may retain a memory of the assembly history of their black holes, probing the black hole occupation fraction of local dwarf galaxies might offer insights into the growth and seeding mechanisms of the first black holes. In this work, we exploit the Western half of the eROSITA all-sky survey (covering $20,000~\rm{deg^2}$) and compile a catalog of accreting SMBHs in local ($D&lt;200$~Mpc) dwarf galaxies. After cleaning our sample from cosmic X-ray background sources, X-ray binaries, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, we identify 74 AGN-dwarf galaxy pairs. Using this large and uniform sample, we derive a luminosity function of dwarf galaxy AGN, fitting it with a power law function and obtaining ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}L_{\rm X} = (15.9\pm2.2)\times L_{\rm X}^{-1.63\pm0.05}$. Measuring the offset between the centroid of dwarf galaxies and the X-ray sources, we find that about $50\%$ of the AGN are likely off-nuclear, in agreement with theoretical predictions. We also compare the black hole-to-stellar mass relation of the AGN in our sample with the local and high-redshift relations, finding that our sources better adhere to the former. This suggests that local AGN across different mass scales underwent a similar growth history. Finally, we compare our sources with semi-analytical models: while our sample is too shallow to distinguish between different seeding models, it favors a growth mechanism linked to the star-formation rate of the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Reconstructed Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave High-Frequency Feature on the Nuclear Equation of State, in Real Interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of gravitational wave (GW) predictions from five two-dimensional Core Collapse Supernova (CCSN) simulations that varied only in the Equation of State (EOS) implemented. The GW signals from these simulations are used to produce spectrograms in the absence of noise, and the emergent high-frequency feature (HFF) is found to differ quantitatively between simulations. Below 1 kHz, the HFF is well approximated by a first-order polynomial in time. The resulting slope was found to vary between 10-50% across all models. Further, using real interferometric noise we investigated the current capabilities of GW detectors to resolve these differences in HFF slope for a Galactic CCSN. We find that for distances up to 1 kpc, current detectors can resolve HFF slopes that vary by at least 30%. For further Galactic distances, current detectors are capable of distinguishing the upper and lower bounds of the HFF slope for groupings of our models that varied in EOS. With the higher sensitivity of future GW detectors, and with improved analysis of the HFF, our ability to resolve properties of the HFF will improve for all Galactic distances. This study shows the potential of using the HFF of CCSN produced GWs to provide insight into the physical processes occurring deep within CCSN during collapse, and in particular its potential to further constrain the EOS through GW detection.</description>

      <title>Measuring the magnetic dipole moment and magnetospheric fluctuations of accretion-powered pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud with an unscented Kalman filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many accretion-powered pulsars rotate in magnetocentrifugal disequilibrium, spinning up or down secularly over multi-year intervals. The magnetic dipole moment $\mu$ of such systems cannot be inferred uniquely from the time-averaged aperiodic X-ray flux $\langle L(t) \rangle$ and pulse period $\langle P(t) \rangle$, because the radiative efficiency of the accretion is unknown and degenerate with the mass accretion rate. Here we circumvent the degeneracy by tracking the fluctuations in the unaveraged time series $L(t)$ and $P(t)$ using an unscented Kalman filter, whereupon $\mu$ can be estimated uniquely, up to the uncertainties in the mass, radius and distance of the star. The analysis is performed on Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations for $24$ X-ray transients in the Small Magellanic Cloud, which have been monitored regularly for $\sim 16$ years. As well as independent estimates of $\mu$, the analysis yields time-resolved histories of the mass accretion rate and the Maxwell stress at the disk-magnetosphere boundary for each star, and hence auto- and cross-correlations involving the latter two state variables. The inferred fluctuation statistics convey important information about the complex accretion physics at the disk-magnetosphere boundary.</description>

      <title>A large population of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries with long outburst recurrence time ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) with neutron stars show quite different features which depend on the rate of mass transfer from the donor star. With a high transfer rate the Z sources are in a persistent soft spectral state, with a moderate rate the transient Atoll sources have outburst cycles like the black hole X-ray binaries. The observations document very long outburst recurrence times for quite a number of sources. We follow with our computations the evolution of the accretion disc until the onset of the ionization instability. For sources with a low mass transfer rate the accumulation of matter in the disc is essentially reduced due to the continuous evaporation of matter from the disc to the coronal flow. Different mass transfer rates result in nearly the same amount of matter accumulated for the outburst which means the outburst properties are similar for sources with short and sources with long outburst cycles, contrary to some expectations. Then of systems with long recurrence time less sources will be detected and the total population of LMXBs could be larger than it appears. This would relieve the apparent problem that the observed number of LMXBs as progenitors of millisecond pulsars (MSP) is too small compared to the number of MSP. Concerning the few quasi-persistent sources with year-long soft states we argue that these states are not outbursts, but quasi-stationary hot states as in Z sources.</description>

      <title>A New Puzzling Periodic Signal in GeV Energies of the $\gamma$-Ray Binary LS I +61$^\circ$303</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LS I + 61$^\circ$303 is a high-mass X-ray binary system comprising a massive Be star and a rapidly rotating neutron star. Its spectral energy distribution across multi-wavelengths categorizes it as a $\gamma$-ray binary system. In our analysis of LS I + 61$^\circ$303 using Fermi-LAT observations, we not only confirmed the three previously discussed periodicities of orbital, superorbital, and orbital-superorbital beat periods observed in multi-wavelength observations, but also identified an additional periodic signal. This newly discovered signal exhibits a period of $\sim$26.3 day at a $\sim7\sigma$ confidence level. Moreover, the power spectrum peak of the new signal gradually decreases as the energy increases across the energy ranges of 0.1-0.3, 0.3-1.0, and 1.0-500.0 GeV. Interestingly, a potential signal with a similar period was found in data obtained from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m telescope. We suggest that the newly discovered periodic signal may originate from a coupling between the orbital period and the retrograde stellar precession period.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. By employing a methodology to stack tracking data in combination with Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain parameter recovery tests, we show that the mission will be sensitive to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-1}$ Hz, provided that tracking data is taken consistently over a large fraction of the cruise duration. Thus, the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. Within this assumption, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(1 - 100)$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

      <title>Jet formation model from accretion disks of electron-ion-photon gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of Astrophysical Jet formation from relativistic accretion disks through the establishment of relativistic disk-powerful jet equilibrium structure is studied applying the Beltrami-Bernoulli equilibrium approach of Shatashvili &amp; Yoshida 2011; Arshilava et al. 2019. Accretion disk is weakly magnetized consisting of fully ionized relativistic electron-ion plasma and photon gas strongly coupled to electrons due to Thompson Scattering. %hence, making the behavior of photon gas similar to that of "a charged fluid". Analysis is based on the generalized Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha $-turbulent dissipation model for local viscosity (being the main source of accretion), in which the contributions from both the photon and ion gases are taken into account. Ignoring the self-gravitation in the disk we constructed the analytical self-similar solutions for the equilibrium relativistic disk-jet structure characteristic parameters in the field of gravitating central compact object for the force-free condition. It is shown, that the magnetic field energy in the Jet is several orders greater compared to that of accretion disk, while jet-outflow is locally Super-Alfv\'enic with local {\it Plasma-beta} $&lt; 1$ near the jet-axis. The derived solutions can be used to analyze the astrophysical jets observed in binary systems during the star formation process linking the jet properties with the parameters of relativistic accretion disks of electron-ion-photon gas.</description>

      <title>The spin magnitude of stellar-mass binary black holes evolves with the mass: evidence from gravitational wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relation between the mass and spin of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) has been proposed to be a smoking gun for the presence of multiple formation channels for compact objects. First-generation black holes (BHs) formed by isolated binary stellar progenitors are expected to have nearly aligned small spins, while nth-generation BBHs resulting from hierarchical mergers are expected to have misaligned and higher spins. Leveraging data from the third observing run O3 (GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3), we employ hierarchical Bayesian methods to conduct a comprehensive study of possible correlations between the BBH masses and spins. We use parametric models that either superpose independent BBH populations or explicitly model a mass-spin correlation. We unveil strong evidence for a correlation between normalized spin magnitudes and masses of BBHs. The correlation can be explained as a transition from a BBH population with low spins at low masses and higher spins for higher masses. Although the spin magnitude distribution at high masses lacks robust constraints, we find strong evidence that a transition between two BBH populations with different spin distributions should happen at 40-50 $M_{\odot}$. In particular, we find that the population of BBHs above 40-50 $M_{\odot}$ should compose the $\sim 2 \%$ of the overall population, with a spin magnitude $\chi$ peaking around 0.7, consistently with the fraction of nth-generation BBHs formed by hierarchical mergers in the latest state-of-the-art BBH genesis simulations.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical scenarios for the formation and evolution of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in the mass range $10^2 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 10^6 M_\odot$ remain uncertain, but future ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers will probe the lower end of the IMBH mass range. We study the detectability of IMBH binary mergers and the measurability of their parameters with next-generation ground-based detector networks consisting of various combinations of Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET) interferometers. We find that, for binaries with component masses $m_{1,2}\sim 1000\,M_\odot$, an optimal 3-detector network can constrain the masses with errors $\lesssim 0.1\%$ ($\lesssim 1\%$) at $z=0.5$ ($z=2$), and the source redshift can be measured with percent-level accuracy or better at $z\lesssim 2$. The redshift of lighter binaries ($m_{1,2}\lesssim 300\,M_\odot$) can still be measured with $O(10)\%$ accuracy even at $z=10$. Binaries with $z\lesssim 0.5$ can be localized within $1\,\rm{deg}^2$ for $m_{1,2}\lesssim 1000\,M_\odot$, and within $0.1\,\rm{deg}^2$ for comparable mass systems. The sky localization is good enough that it may be possible to cross-correlate GW searches with galaxy catalogs and to search for electromagnetic counterparts to IMBH mergers. We also point out that the low-frequency sensitivity of the detectors is crucial for IMBH detection and parameter estimation. It will be interesting to use our results in conjunction with population synthesis codes to constrain astrophysical IMBH formation models.</description>

      <title>Solar chameleons: novel channels (I)</title>

Abstract: We revisit the flux of chameleons (light scalar particles which could play a role in the dark energy phenomenon) produced in the interior of the Sun. Our novel analysis incorporates various important details and new processes that have previously been overlooked, including the impact of the bulk magnetic field profile, as well as Primakoff production of chameleons in the electric fields of electrons and ions. In this paper we consider only the contributions of transverse photons. The production of chameleons from longitudinal electromagnetic excitations will be presented in a dedicated follow-up work. Demanding that the total flux of chameleons does not exceed 3% of the solar luminosity leads to the stringent upper limit on the chameleon-photon conformal coupling $\beta_\gamma \lesssim 10^{10}$, assuming that the height of the chameleon potential is set to the dark energy scale $\Lambda = 2.4$ meV, and independently of other couplings to matter. Although this bound is tighter than current upper limits on $\beta_{\gamma}$ from the CAST helioscope, these limits will have to be reassessed in terms of the updated solar chameleon flux we have computed. We argue that solar chameleons, potentially detectable in next-generation helioscopes such as IAXO, can be used to probe a region of chameleon parameter space that has yet to be covered.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Driven Inspirals of Non-relativistic Binaries Connected by Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider gravitational waves from a pair of non-relativistically moving monopoles or black holes connected by a cosmic string. Shortly after the binary's formation, the connecting string straightens due the direct coupling of its motion to gravitational radiation. Afterwards, the motion of the binary can be well-approximated by a non-relativistic motion of its components that have an additional constant mutual attraction force due to the tension of the straight string that connects them. The orbit shrinks due to the gravitational radiation backreacting on the binary's components. We find that if the binary's semimajor axis $a\gg \sqrt{R_1 R_2/{\mu}}$, its eccentricity grows on the inspiral's timescale; here $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the gravitational radii of the binary components, and $\mu$ is the dimensionless tension of the string. When the eccentricity is high, it approaches unity super-exponentially. If the binary's components are monopole-antimonopole pair, this leads to the physical collision that would likely destroy the string and annihilate the monopoles when the semimajor axis is still many orders of magnitude greater than the string thickness. If the binary's components are black holes, then the eccentricity reaches its peak when $a\sim \sqrt{R_1 R_2/\mu}$, and then decays according to the standard Peter's formula. The black-hole spins initially become locked to the orbital motion, but then lag behind as the inspiral proceeds. We estimate the string-tension-induced dimensionless spins just prior to the merger and find them to be $\sim\mu^{3/8}\ll 1$.</description>

      <title>Managing the Growing Complexity of Multi-Messenger Transient Events with Astro-COLIBRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of transient phenomena, such as GRBs, FRBs, novae/supernovae explosions, coupled with the detection of cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, have transformed astrophysics. Maximizing the discovery potential necessitates tools for swiftly acquiring an overview of the most relevant information for each new detection. Introducing Astro-COLIBRI, a comprehensive platform designed to meet this challenge. Astro-COLIBRI features a public API, real-time databases and alert systems, a discussion forum, and a website and iOS/Android apps as user clients. In real time, it evaluates incoming astronomical observation messages from all available alert streams, filters them based on user-defined criteria, and contextualizes them in the multi-wavelength (MWL) and multi-messenger (MM) context. User clients offer a graphical representation, providing a succinct summary for quick identification of interesting phenomena and assessing observing conditions globally.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the optical emission lines and the X-ray emission during the super-active stage of T CrB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T CrB is a symbiotic star that experiences nova outbursts every $\sim$ 80~yr. The next, long-anticipated nova outburst should occur during the 2024-2026 period. Here, we present results of high-resolution optical spectroscopy of T CrB in the period 2016 - 2023. In these spectra, we measured the equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, HeI and HeII emission lines. The maximum equivalent width (EW) was recorded on May 2021, when the EW of $H\alpha$ reached -44.6 \AA and H$\beta$ = -21.5 \AA. At the other extreme, the minimum of EW($H\alpha$)= -2.9 \AA was recorded in October 2023. After October 2023, the B-band emission brightened, suggesting a re-appearance of the orbital modulation. In addition to the optical data, we study the X-ray behaviour in the same period. We find a strong correlation between $EW(H\alpha)$ and X-ray flux with a correlation coefficient -0.78 and a significance of 2.6$\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$: the GOTO project for real-time citizen science in time-domain astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-domain astrophysics continues to grow rapidly, with the inception of new surveys drastically increasing data volumes. Democratised, distributed approaches to training sets for machine learning classifiers are crucial to make the most of this torrent of discovery -- with citizen science approaches proving effective at meeting these requirements. In this paper, we describe the creation of and the initial results from the $\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$ citizen science project, built to find transient phenomena from the GOTO telescopes in near real-time. $\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$ launched in July 2023 and received over 600,000 classifications from approximately 2,000 volunteers over the course of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a observing run. During this time, the project has yielded 20 discoveries, generated a `gold-standard' training set of 17,682 detections for augmenting deep-learned classifiers, and measured the performance and biases of Zooniverse volunteers on real-bogus classification. This project will continue throughout the lifetime of GOTO, pushing candidates at ever-greater cadence, and directly facilitate the next-generation classification algorithms currently in development.</description>

      <title>The story of SN 2021aatd -- a peculiar 1987A-like supernova with an early-phase luminosity excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing number of peculiar events that cannot be assigned to any of the main supernova (SN) classes. SN 1987A and a handful of similar objects, thought to be explosive outcomes of blue supergiant stars, belong to them: while their spectra closely resemble those of H-rich (IIP) SNe, their light-curve (LC) evolution is very different. Here we present the detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of SN 2021aatd, a peculiar Type II explosion: while its early-time evolution resembles that of the slowly evolving, double-peaked SN 2020faa (however, at a lower luminosity scale), after $\sim$40 days, its LC shape becomes similar to that of SN 1987A-like explosions. Beyond comparing LCs, color curves, and spectra of SN 2021aatd to that of SNe 2020faa, 1987A, and of other objects, we compare the observed spectra with our own SYN++ models and with the outputs of published radiative transfer models. We also modeled the pseudo-bolometric LCs of SNe 2021aatd and 1987A assuming a two-component (core+shell) ejecta, and involving the rotational energy of a newborn magnetar in addition to radioactive decay. We find that both the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2021aatd can be well described with the explosion of a $\sim$15 $M_\odot$ blue supergiant star. Nevertheless, SN 2021aatd shows higher temperatures and weaker Na ID and Ba II 6142 A lines than SN 1987A, which is reminiscent of rather to IIP-like atmospheres. With the applied two-component ejecta model (counting with both decay and magnetar energy), we can successfully describe the bolometric LC of SN 2021aatd, including the first $\sim$40-day long phase showing an excess compared to 87A-like SNe but being strikingly similar to that of the long-lived SN 2020faa. Nevertheless, finding a unified model that also explains the LCs of more luminous events (like SN 2020faa) is still a matter of concern.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry, Gap Opening and High Accretion Rate on DM Tau: A Hypothesis Based on Interaction of Magnetized Disk Wind with Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over two hundred protoplanetary disk systems have been resolved by ALMA, and the vast majority suggest the presence of planets. The dust gaps in transition disks are considered evidence of giant planets sculpting gas and dust under appropriate disk viscosity. However, the unusually high accretion rates in many T Tauri stars hosting transition disks challenge this theory. As the only disk currently observed with high turbulence, the high accretion rate ($\sim10^{-8.3}M_{\odot}/yr$) observed in DM Tau indicates the presence of strong turbulence may within the system. Considering the recent theoretical advancements in magnetized disk winds is challenging the traditional gap-opening theories and viscosity-driven accretion models, our study presents a pioneering simulation incorporating a simplified magnetized disk wind model to explain the observed features in DM Tau. Employing multi-fluid simulations with an embedded medium mass planet, we successfully replicate the gap formation and asymmetric structures evident in ALMA Band 6 and the recently JVLA 7 mm observations. Our results suggest that when magnetized disk wind dominate the accretion mode of the system, it's entirely possible for a planet with a medium mass to exist within the gap inside 20 au of DM Tau. This means that DM Tau may not be as turbulence as imagined. However, viscosity within the disk should also contribute a few turbulence to maintain disk stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.08005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a sophisticated model of FRB observations, accounting for the intrinsic cosmological gas distribution and host galaxy contributions, and give the most detailed account yet of observational biases due to burst width, dispersion measure, and the exact telescope beamshape. Our results offer a significant increase in both accuracy and precision beyond those previously obtained. Using results from ASKAP and Parkes, we present our best-fit FRB population parameters in a companion paper. Here, we consider in detail the expected and fitted distributions in redshift, dispersion measure, and signal-to-noise. We estimate that the unlocalised ASKAP FRBs arise from $z&lt;0.5$, with between a third and a half within $z&lt;0.1$. Our predicted source-counts (''logN-logS'') distribution confirms previous indications of a steepening index near the Parkes detection threshold of $1$ Jy ms. We find no evidence for a minimum FRB energy, and rule out $E_{\rm min} &gt; 10^{39.0}$ erg at 90% C.L. Importantly, we find that above a certain DM, observational biases cause the Macquart (DM-z) relation to become inverted, implying that the highest-DM events detected in the unlocalised Parkes and ASKAP samples are unlikely to be the most distant. More localized FRBs will be required to quantitatively estimate this effect, though its cause is a well-understood observational bias. Works assuming a 1-1 DM-z relation may therefore derive erroneous results. Our analysis of errors suggests that limiting factors in our analysis are understanding of FRB spectral behaviour, sensitivity response of search experiments, and the treatment of the repeating population and luminosity function.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the acceleration of particles by a powerful relativistic jet associated with the activity of a supermassive black hole in the Galactic center several million years ago may explain the observed cosmic ray spectrum at energies higher than $10^{15}$ eV. The accelerated particles are efficiently confined in the extended magnetized gas halo created by the supernova and central black hole activity just after the Galaxy formation. We found that both the heavy and light chemical composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays can be consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Interplay Between Neutrino Kicks and Hydrodynamic Kicks of Neutron Stars and Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are observed with high space velocities and elliptical orbits in binaries. The magnitude of these effects points to natal kicks that originate from asymmetries during the supernova (SN) explosions. Using a growing set of long-time 3D SN simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, we explore the interplay of NS kicks that are induced by asymmetric neutrino emission and by asymmetric mass ejection. Anisotropic neutrino emission can arise from a large-amplitude dipolar convection asymmetry inside the proto-NS (PNS) termed LESA (Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry) and from aspherical accretion downflows around the PNS, which can lead to anisotropic neutrino emission (absorption) with a neutrino-induced NS kick roughly opposite to (aligned with) the kick by asymmetric mass ejection. In massive progenitors hydrodynamic kicks can reach up to more than 1300 km/s, whereas our calculated neutrino kicks reach (55-140) km/s (estimated upper bounds of (170-265) km/s) and only about (10-50) km/s, if LESA is the main cause of asymmetric neutrino emission. Therefore hydrodynamic NS kicks dominate in explosions of high-mass progenitors, whereas LESA-induced neutrino kicks dominate for NSs born in low-energy SNe of the lowest-mass progenitors, when these explode nearly spherically. Our models suggest that the Crab pulsar with its velocity of about 160 km/s, if born in the low-energy explosion of a low-mass, single-star progenitor, should have received a hydrodynamic kick in a considerably asymmetric explosion. Black holes, if formed by the collapse of short-lived PNSs and solely kicked by anisotropic neutrino emission, obtain velocities of only some km/s.</description>

      <title>The Redshift Evolution of the Binary Black Hole Mass Distribution from Dense Star Clusters</title>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors are unveiling a population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts $z \approx 1$, and are starting to constrain how the BBH population evolves with redshift. We present predictions for the redshift evolution of the BBH mass and spin distributions for systems originating from dense star clusters. Utilizing a grid of 144 state-of-the-art dynamical models for globular clusters, we demonstrate that BBH merger rates peak at higher redshifts for larger black hole primary masses $M_1$. Specifically, for $M_1\gtrsim40\,M_{\odot}$, the BBH merger rate reaches its peak at redshift $z\approx2.1$, while for $M_1\lesssim20\,M_{\odot}$, the peak occurs at $z\approx1.1$, assuming that the cluster formation rate peaks at $z=2.2$. The average BBH primary mass also increases from $\sim 10\,M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$ to $\sim 30\,M_{\odot}$ at $z=10$. We show that $\sim 20\%$ BBHs contain massive remnants from next-generation mergers, with this fraction increasing (decreasing) for larger (smaller) primary masses. This difference is not large enough to significantly alter the effective spins of the BBH population originating from globular clusters, and we find that their effective spin distribution does not evolve across cosmic time. These findings can be used to distinguish BBHs from dense star clusters by future gravitational wave observations.</description>

Abstract: I demonstrate the usage of planetary nebulae (PNe) to infer that a pair of jets shaped the ejecta of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 1987A. The main structure of the SN 1987A inner ejecta, the keyhole, comprised two low-intensity zones. The northern one has a bright rim on its front, while the southern one has an elongated nozzle. Earlier comparison of the SN 1987A keyhole with bubbles in the galaxy group NGC 5813 led to its identification as a jet-shaped rim-nozzle structure. Here, I present rim-nozzle asymmetry in planetary nebulae (PNe), thought to be shaped by jets, which solidify the claim that jets powered the ejecta of SN 1987A and other CCSNe. This finding for the iconic SN 1987A with its unique properties strengthens the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe. In a few hundred years, the CCSN 1987A will have a complicated structure with two main symmetry axes, one along the axis of the three circumstellar rings that two opposite 20,000-years pre-explosion jets shaped, and the other along the long axis of the keyhole that was shaped by the main (but not the only) jet pair of the exploding jets of SN 1987A in the frame of the JJEM.</description>

      <title>An Optical Gamma-Ray Burst Catalogue with Measured Redshift PART I: Data Release of 535 Gamma-Ray Bursts and Colour Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the largest optical photometry compilation of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) with redshifts ($z$). We include 64813 observations of 535 events (including upper limits) from 28 February 1997 up to 18 August 2023. We also present a user-friendly web tool \textit{grbLC} which allows users the visualization of photometry, coordinates, redshift, host galaxy extinction, and spectral indices for each event in our database. Furthermore, we have added a Gamma Ray Coordinate Network (GCN) scraper that can be used to collect data by gathering magnitudes from the GCNs. The web tool also includes a package for uniformly investigating colour evolution. We compute the optical spectral indices for 138 GRBs for which we have at least 4 filters at the same epoch in our sample and craft a procedure to distinguish between GRBs with and without colour evolution. By providing a uniform format and repository for the optical catalogue, this web-based archive is the first step towards unifying several community efforts to gather the photometric information for all GRBs with known redshifts. This catalogue will enable population studies by providing light curves (LCs) with better coverage since we have gathered data from different ground-based locations. Consequently, these LCs can be used to train future LC reconstructions for an extended inference of the redshift. The data gathering also allows us to fill some of the orbital gaps from Swift in crucial points of the LCs, e.g., at the end of the plateau emission or where a jet break is identified.</description>

      <title>The discovery and significance of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2007 we were part of a team that discovered the so-called ``Lorimer Burst'', the first example of a new class of objects now known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). These enigmatic events are only a few ms in duration and occur at random locations on the sky at a rate of a few thousand per day. Several thousand FRBs are currently known. While it is now well established that they have a cosmological origin, and about 10\% of all currently known sources have been seen to exhibit multiple bursts, the origins of these enigmatic sources are currently poorly understood. In this article, we review the discovery of FRBs and present some of the highlights from the vast body of work by an international community. Following a brief overview of the scale of the visible Universe in \S 1, we describe the key moments in radio astronomy (\S 2) that led up to the discovery of the Lorimer burst (\S 3). Early efforts to find more FRBs are described in \S 4 which led to the discovery of the first repeating source (\S 5). In \S 6, as we close out on the second decade of FRBs, we outline some of the many open questions in the field and look ahead to the coming years where many surprises are surely in store.</description>

      <title>MADHAT: Model-Agnostic Dark Halo Analysis Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.02890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Model-Agnostic Dark Halo Analysis Tool (MADHAT), a numerical tool which implements a Fermi-LAT data-driven, model-independent analysis of gamma-ray emission from dwarf satellite galaxies and dwarf galaxy candidates due to dark matter annihilation, dark matter decay, or other nonstandard or unknown astrophysics. This tool efficiently provides statistical upper bounds on the number of observed photons in excess of the number expected, based on empirical determinations of foregrounds and backgrounds, using a stacked analysis of any selected set of dwarf targets. It also calculates the resulting bounds on the properties of dark matter under any assumptions the user makes regarding dark sector particle physics or astrophysics. As an application, we determine new bounds on Sommerfeld-enhanced dark matter annihilation in a set of eight dwarfs. MADHAT v1.0 includes 58 dwarfs and dwarf candidate targets, and we discuss future planned developments. MADHAT is available and will be maintained at https://github.com/MADHATdm</description>

      <title>Evaporation Barrier for Dark Matter in Celestial Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimum testable dark matter (DM) mass for almost all DM signatures in celestial bodies is determined by the rate at which DM evaporates. DM evaporation has previously been calculated assuming a competition between the gravitational potential of the object, and thermal kicks from the celestial-body matter. We point out a new effect, where mediators with a range larger than the interparticle spacing induce a force proportional to the density gradient of celestial objects, forming an evaporation barrier for the DM. This effect can be so significant that evaporation does not occur even for sub-MeV DM, in stark contrast to previous calculations. This opens up a wide range of new light DM searches, many orders of magnitude in DM mass below the sensitivity of direct detection.</description>

      <title>Milky Way White Dwarfs as Sub-GeV to Multi-TeV Dark Matter Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Milky Way white dwarfs are excellent targets for dark matter (DM) detection. Using Fermi and H.E.S.S. Galactic center gamma-ray data, we investigate sensitivity to DM annihilating within white dwarfs into long-lived or boosted mediators and producing detectable gamma rays. Depending on the Galactic DM distribution, we set new constraints on the spin-independent scattering cross section down to $10^{-45}-10^{-41}$ cm$^2$ in the sub-GeV DM mass range, which is multiple orders of magnitude stronger than existing limits. For a generalized NFW DM profile, we find that our white dwarf constraints exceed spin-independent direct detection limits across most of the sub-GeV to multi-TeV DM mass range, achieving sensitivities as low as about $10^{-46}$ cm$^2$. In addition, we improve earlier versions of the DM capture calculation in white dwarfs, by including the low-temperature distribution of nuclei when the white dwarf approaches crystallization. This yields smaller capture rates than previously calculated by a factor of a few up to two orders of magnitude, depending on white dwarf size and the astrophysical system.</description>

      <title>Binary mergers in strong gravity background of Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers can take place close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) while being in a bound orbit around the SMBH. In this paper, we study such bound triple systems and show that including the strong gravity effects of describing the SMBH with a Kerr metric can significantly modify the dynamics, as compared to a Newtonian point particle description of the SMBH. We extract the dynamics of the system, using a quadrupole approximation to the tidal forces due to the SMBH. We exhibit how the gyroscope precession is built into this dynamics, and find the secular Hamiltonian by both averaging over the inner and outer orbits, the latter being the orbit of the BBH around the SMBH. We study the long-time-scale dynamics, including the periastron precession and GW radiation-reaction of the binary system, finding that the strong gravity effects of the SMBH can enhance the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism, resulting in more cycles, higher maximum eccentricity, and thereby a shorter merger time, particularly when the binary is close to, or at, the innermost stable orbit of the SMBH. We end with an analysis of the peak frequency of the GW emission from the binary system, highlighting possible observable signatures in the LISA and ET frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Effects of dilute neutron matter on the neutron star crust equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a compressible liquid-drop model to describe the crust of neutron stars for which the role of the nuclear clusters, the neutron gas, and the electrons are clearly identified. The novelty relies on the contribution of the neutron gas, which is qualitatively adjusted to reproduce 'ab initio' predictions in dilute neutron matter. We relate the properties of dilute neutron matter to the ones of neutron stars crust and we compare the mean-field approximation to an improved approach that better describes dilute neutron matter. The latter is quite sensitive to the unitary limit, a universal feature of Fermi systems having a large value of the scattering length and a small interaction range. While the impact of the accurate description of dilute neutron matter is important in uniform matter (up to 30\% corrections with respect to a mean-field calculations), we find a reduction of this impact in the context of the crust of neutron stars due to the additional matter components (nuclear clusters and electrons). In agreement with our previous works, dilute neutron matter is however a necessary ingredient for accurate predictions of the properties of the crust of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Improving the Cosmological Constraints by Inferring the Formation Channel of Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could be detected by space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), TianQin and Taiji. Localizing EMRIs by GW detectors can help us select candidate host galaxies, which can be used to infer the cosmic expansion history. In this paper, we demonstrate that the localization information can also be used to infer the formation channel of EMRIs, and hence allow us to extract more precisely the redshift probability distributions. By conducting mock observations of the EMRIs which can be detected by TianQin and LISA, as well as the galaxies which can be provided by the future Chinese Space Station Telescope, we find that TianQin can constrain the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ to a precision of $\sim3\%-8\%$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ to $\sim10\%-40\%$. The TianQin+LISA network, by increasing the localization accuracy, can improve the precisions of $H_0$ and $w_0$ to $\sim0.4\%-7\%$ and $\sim4\%-20\%$, respectively. Then, considering an illustrative case in which all EMRIs originate in AGNs, and combining the mock EMRI observation with a mock AGN catalog, we show that TianQin can recognize the EMRI-AGN correlation with $\sim 1300$ detections. The TianQin+LISA network can reduce this required number to $\sim 30$. Additionally, we propose a statistical method to directly estimate the fraction of EMRIs produced in AGNs, $f_{\rm agn}$, and show that observationally deriving this value could significantly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters. These results demonstrate the potentials of using EMRIs as well as galaxy and AGN surveys to improve the constraints on cosmological parameters and the formation channel of EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the harm caused by cosmic radiation, consisting of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, is an important safety concern for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation includes experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators and is currently pioneering the progress in this field. Curiously, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological response pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth can provide effective solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. We also recommend evaluating the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>
