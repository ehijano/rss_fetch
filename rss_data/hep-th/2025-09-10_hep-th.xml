      <title>Physics and Geometry of Complex Structure Limits in Type IIB Calabi-Yau Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed geometric and physical interpretation of infinite distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of Type IIB compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds, motivated by the Emergent String Conjecture. In the framework of semi-stable degenerations, such limits are characterised by a simple fibration structure of the fastest vanishing three-cycles. The previously studied Hodge theoretic classification of infinite distance limits of type II, III, and IV is reflected in the number of one-cycles of the shrinking fibres. Complementing our recent work on limits of type II, we focus here on type III and type IV degenerations. Based on effective field theory considerations, these are expected to be decompactification limits to 6d and 5d, respectively. However, establishing the existence of the associated Kaluza-Klein tower(s) of states with both the appropriate mass scaling and the correct degeneracy requires explicit geometric input. We show that the aforementioned vanishing three-cycles are special Lagrangian three-tori, thus giving rise to towers of asymptotically massless BPS particles from multi-wrapped D3-branes with the degeneracy of a Kaluza-Klein tower. We furthermore relate the BPS index of these three-cycles to the Euler characteristic of the threefold. Finally, we systematically analyse infinite distance trajectories in multi-parameter limits described by so-called enhancement chains. We find that the primary singularity type encodes the gravitational duality frame of the limit whereas the secondary singularity type is related to the rank of the gauge group coupled to gravity. The specifics of the asymptotic physics depend crucially on whether or not the trajectory is induced by the backreaction of an EFT string.</description>

      <title>Impact of quantum gravity on the UV sensitivity of extremal black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has revealed that extremal Kerr black holes may exhibit a sensitivity to higher-derivative corrections to Einstein's equations, displaying singularities in the tidal forces at the horizon. However, in a purely gravitational context, this "ultraviolet sensitivity" translates into a strong dependence on the Wilson coefficients in the low-energy effective field theory. These, in turn, are fixed by the underlying theory of quantum gravity in the ultraviolet. We find a prediction for these coefficients within the framework of asymptotically safe quantum gravity, and show that, if the quantum gravity scale is trans-Planckian, this horizon-scale ultraviolet sensitivity is avoided.</description>

      <title>Consistent Four-derivative Heterotic Truncations and the Kerr-Sen Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a $p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a $(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other, and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.</description>

      <title>Cosmology, Decoherence and the Second Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum decoherence and entropy increase in early universe cosmology. We first study decoherence in a discrete bipartite quantum system for which a single qubit gets entangled with an environment and the entropy increase is correlated with the decay of the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix. We compare this system with continuous systems relevant for cosmology for which there is a natural external intervention, corresponding to the time-dependent separation between the sub- and super-horizon inflationary fluctuations. We find, in this case, that the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix, in a field basis, do not decay as sometimes assumed in cosmological set-ups. Nevertheless, following a recent treatment in terms of open Effective Field Theories (EFTs), we compute the entanglement entropy for a Gaussian state and show that it actually increases monotonically ($\dot S&gt;0$) during the accelerated phases ($\ddot a&gt;0$ with $a(t)$ the scale factor). We generalise this result to include non-Gaussian states and briefly discuss the relevance of computing the von Neumann entropy as compared to the thermodynamic entropy.</description>

      <title>Fermi Geometry of the Higgs Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the field space geometry of scalar-fermion effective field theories as a vector bundle supermanifold. We further establish a Fermi normal coordinate system on the bundle that clarifies the geometric content in scattering amplitudes, particularly the imprints of field space non-analyticities. Specializing to the Standard Model Higgs sector, we examine the geometric consequences of custodial symmetry violation, including implications for the physical Higgs field as a distinguished scalar axis and deformations in the fermionic sector. Our results enable a systematic and realistic geometric interpretation of Higgs sector phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Conformal 3-point correlators in momentum space, method of subgraphs and the $1/N$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to few parameters, which are known only at the leading order in the perturbative expansions. The major challenges are from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and it closely relates to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of the conserved current 3-point correlators using the exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that the multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to the constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep the first few terms of the subgraphs to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to the current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative result with the bootstrap data and discuss its application for the conductivity near the quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Casimir energy in the Curci-Ferrari model through a functional approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using functional integral methods, we investigate the non-Abelian Casimir energy in the Curci-Ferrari model, which offers an effective description of the infrared regime of Yang-Mills theory. We consider a 3+1D (resp.\ 2+1D) system of two infinite parallel plates (resp.\ wires) at a fixed distance from each other, with either perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) or perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions. Imposing the boundary conditions directly in the functional integral by the introduction of suitable auxiliary fields that act as Lagrange multipliers, we obtain a boundary effective action that captures the dynamics of this system. The Casimir energy is then computed both directly from the functional integral and via the energy-momentum tensor, providing equivalent results. We find that the Casimir energy for PEC and PMC conditions differs by a constant factor, which can be traced back to a van Dam--Veltman--Zakharov-like discontinuity (both in 3+1D and 2+1D). Lastly, we show that our analytical results are compatible with a variety of recent numerical lattice simulations of the non-perturbative Yang-Mills Casimir energy, in which a novel non-perturbative mass scale emerges.</description>

      <title>Higgs Field as Architect of a Geodesically Complete Universe and Agent for New Physics in Interiors of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs boson is often compared to a small ripple on a vast, calm ocean. This "ocean" is the universal Higgs vacuum expectation value, about 246 GeV, permeating all space and generating particle masses. Its remarkable uniformity reflects the large-scale nature of the universe. Here I argue that the Higgs field plays a far deeper role. In regions of extreme gravity near singularities, it becomes a non-perturbative, space-time--dependent field that creates new space-time domains beyond gravitational singularities -- new regions governed by antigravity. This mechanism produces dramatic dynamics inside black holes and in the earliest universe, including restoration of the electroweak symmetry SU(2)xU(1) at singularities. The adjoining gravity and antigravity regions form a geodesically complete space-time bridged by traversable singularities -- absent in the Standard Model coupled to general relativity or its extensions such as string theory. In such a framework, the black hole information paradox admits a new, manifestly unitary resolution. Details of computations are developed in the companion paper [1]; here, only a brief outline is given.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the action of a global symmetry group on the anyon system is one of the central topics of research. Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, such group actions do not automatically satisfy associativity. The obstruction is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose presence signals a failure of group associativity. In these cases, the symmetry structure is no longer described by an ordinary group, but instead by a $2$-group -- a group-like structure extended by a $1$-form symmetry. In this short note, we prove that the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry always vanishes in abelian bosonic TQFTs.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory and Integrability: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While general quantum field theories (QFTs) have yet to be rigorously defined in mathematics, they have generated new mathematics and have served as a unifying principle connecting different branches of the subject. In 1989, Witten made a profound impact on the mathematical community by systematically constructing knot invariants via the three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. One of the historical roots of knot invariants was integrable models, whose explanation in terms of QFT remained unsolved for decades. Recently, this problem was solved by a perturbative analysis of the four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, which provides a novel framework for understanding and unifying many different aspects of integrable models. In this article, we summarize the basic aspects of these developments for non-experts in both physics and mathematics.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Conformal Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the gauged quiver quantum mechanics realizing $D(2,1;0)$ superconformal symmetry. These models arise as effective descriptions of multi-centered D-brane systems in type II Calabi-Yau compactifications, in the $AdS_2$ scaling limit, and they describe the near-horizon microscopics of multi-centered BPS black holes in the four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity. We work in the gauged sigma model formulation with off-shell $(4,4,0)$ multiplets, which allows us to introduce a coordinate system adapted to the complex structure of the gauged sigma model target space, that assigns a radial-angular frame to each quiver node in the physical configuration space. It provides an explicit decomposition of the sigma model quiver metric into distinct sectors governed by couplings between each node. We compute the full target space metric for 2-node and 3-node quiver configurations, and generalize to symmetric $N$-node crystal quivers. Finally we implement Gaiotto-Simons-Strominger-Yin's $D(2,1;0)$ index for this system and show that the corresponding gauged superconformal index -- at least in a rich family of physical examples -- provides a new tool for resolving the conical singularity complications generically present in the ungauged superconformal mechanics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry TFTs for Continuous Spacetime Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous spacetime symmetries. For a $d$-dimensional theory, it is given by a $(d+1)$-dimensional BF-theory for the spacetime symmetry group, and whenever $d$ is even, it can also include Chern-Simons couplings that encode conformal and gravitational anomalies. We study the boundary conditions for this SymTFT and describe the general setup to study symmetry breaking of spacetime symmetries. We then specialize to the conformal symmetry case and derive the dilaton action for conformal symmetry breaking. To further substantiate that our setup captures spacetime symmetries, we demonstrate that the topological defects of the SymTFT realize the associated spacetime symmetry transformations. Finally, we study the relation to gravity and holography. The proposal classically coincides with two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for $d=1$ as well as the topological limit of four-dimensional gravity in the $d=3$ case.</description>

      <title>Coherent quantum work extraction of a relativistic battery as a probe for acceleration-induced Unruh thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a physical scheme of a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt battery and utilize quantum work extraction as a probe to witness the thermal nature of the Unruh effect induced by the accelerated motion. By employing the open quantum system approach, we analyze the coherent and incoherent components of the ergotropy which is the maximum amount of quantum work extraction of the relativistic battery driven by a coherent field. It has been proved that the steady values of coherent quantum work extraction in the asymptotic condition is only determined by the acceleration-dependent Unruh temperature. The asymptotic behavior of coherent ergotropy can demonstrate the thermal nature of the Unruh effect with respect to the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition. Under the circumstance of the Unruh effect, we explore the effect of the phase of the coherent charging field on the dynamics of coherent ergotropy when the battery approaches to the same thermal equilibrium state. The variation in the phase of the coherent driving field can improve the energy storage capacity of a relativistic battery. From viewpoint of energy transfer, the relativistic battery is helpful to examine the Unruh thermality.</description>

Specifically, the results of Chatterjee and Diaconis, which rely exclusively on the high-energy behavior, are compared and reconciled with those of the standard physics approach, where the existence of condensation is determined by the low-energy behavior.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamics of readout devices and semiclassical gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the common claim that nonlinear modifications of quantum theory necessarily violate the second law of thermodynamics. We focus on hypothetical extensions of quantum theory that contain readout devices. These black boxes provide a classical description of quantum states without perturbing them. They allow quantum state cloning, though in a way consistent with the relativistic no-signalling principle. We review the existence of such devices in the context of Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity, which postulates that the gravitational field remains classical and is sourced by the expectation value of a quantum energy-momentum tensor. We show that the definition of information in the models examined in this paper deviates from that given by von Neumann entropy, and that claims of second law violations based on the distinguishability of non-orthogonal states or on violations of uncertainty principles fail to hold in such theories.</description>

      <title>Clifford quantum cellular automata from topological quantum field theories and invertible subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l+1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l-2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l+1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l-1)$ dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibilities of detecting MeV-scale boosted dark matter (DM) via astrophysical observations. Given a particular model framework, using gamma-ray data from \texttt{COMPTEL} and \texttt{EGRET}, as well as neutrino constraints from the \texttt{Super-Kamiokande}, \texttt{Hyper-Kamiokande}, \texttt{JUNO}, diffuse supernova neutrino background (\texttt{DSNB}), and atmospheric neutrino observations, we find that boosted light scalar DM could be probed within the mass range of $\sim 20\!-\!80$ MeV, satisfying the Planck observed relic abundance. Our study shows, indirect search can play a key role in the detection of MeV-scale boosted DM, which are otherwise beyond the reach of usual collider or DM scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-similar collapse with elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical collapse is a well-studied subject for a variety of self-gravitating matter. One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids, which have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as well as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to possess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and critical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In this work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study self-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show that including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations, which we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value problem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode, but also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid case, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the addition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\mathrm{s}$ or decreasing the Poisson ratio $\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and can yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the elastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible transverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid case can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not seem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters of the material. This study represents the first step in the analysis of critical collapse with elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Scale dependence improvement of the quartic scalar field thermal effective potential in the optimized perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory, as well as most thermal field resummation methods widely used to study finite-temperature quantum field theories, presents a non-negligible renormalization scale dependence. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method that combines the Renormalization Group Improvement (RGI) prescription for the thermal effective potential with the Optimized Perturbation Theory (OPT) variational resummation technique. Here, we apply this new framework, termed Variational Renormalization Group (VRG), to evaluate the effective potential of the scalar $\lambda \phi^4$ theory at finite temperatures, which represents a benchmark model for phase transition studies. We show that the proposed approach significantly improves scale stability, compared to the use of OPT alone, across key thermodynamic quantities, including the effective potential, critical temperature, and pressure. These results establish the VRG as a robust alternative tool for precision studies of thermal phase transitions, with direct implications for cosmological applications (e.g., early-universe thermodynamics) and condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Neglected solutions in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on several previously overlooked families of static spherically symmetric solutions in quadratic gravity. Our main result concerns the existence of solutions whose leading exponents depend on the ratio ${\omega=\alpha/(3\beta)}$ of the four-derivative couplings. We demonstrate that the space of models with ${\omega &gt;1}$ contains a dense set that admits non-Frobenius solutions ${(s_*, 2 - 3 s_*)_0}$ (in standard Schwarzschild coordinates), with certain rational numbers $s_*(\omega)$. These solutions correspond to a singular core at ${\bar{r}=0}$. Another related non-Frobenius family, $(s_*, 2 - 3 s_*)_\infty$, exists for a dense set of models with ${1/4 &lt; \omega &lt; 1}$, describing a singular boundary at ${\bar{r}\to\infty}$. Both families are uncovered by recasting the metric into special coordinates in which the solutions become Frobenius. Additionally, for models with any real ratios ${\omega\neq 1}$ we identify two novel families of non-Frobenius solutions around generic points ${\bar{r}=\bar{r}_0}$, $(3/2, 0)_{\bar{r}_0, 1/4}$ and $(3/2, 0)_{\bar{r}_0, 1/2}$ describing a wormhole throat. Finally, we re-derive and summarize all known families of solutions in the standard as well as in modified Schwarzschild coordinates.</description>

      <title>A set of master variables for the two-star random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such 'master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of 'large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.</description>

      <title>Quasicoherent states of noncommutative D2-branes, Aharonov-Bohm effect and quantum Mobius strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find an analytical formula for the quasicoherent states of 3D fuzzy spaces defined by algebras generated by bosonic creation and annihilation operators. This one is expressed in a representation onto the coherent states of the CCR algebra. Such a fuzzy space can be assimilated to a noncommutative D2-brane of the M-theory (but also as a model of a qubit in contact with a bosonic environment). We apply this formula onto a D2-brane wrapped around an axis to obtain the geometry of a noncommutative cylinder. We show that the adiabatic transport of its quasicoherent states exhibits a topological effect similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We study also a D2-brane wrapped and twisted to have the geometry of a noncommutative Mobius strip. Finally we briefly present the other two examples of a noncommutative torus and of a noncommutative Klein bottle.</description>

      <title>Covariant Carrollian Electric and Magnetic Limits of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Carrollian limit ($c \to 0$) of General Relativity provides the geometric language for describing null hypersurfaces, such as black hole event horizons and null infinity. Motivated by the well-established electric and magnetic limits of Galilean electromagnetism, we perform a systematic analysis of the low-velocity limit of linearized gravity to derive its Carrollian counterparts. Using a 1+3 covariant decomposition, we study the transformation properties of linear tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) on a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background under Carrollian boosts. We demonstrate that, analogous to the electromagnetic case, the full set of linearized Einstein's equations is not Carrollian-invariant. Instead, the theory bifurcates into two distinct and consistent frameworks: a Carrollian Electric Limit and a Carrollian Magnetic Limit. In the electric limit, dynamics are frozen, leaving a static theory of tidal forces ($E_{ab}$) constrained by the matter distribution. In contrast, the Magnetic Limit yields a consistent dynamical theory where the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor ($H_{ab}$), which governs gravito-magnetic and radiative effects, remains well-defined and is sourced by the spacetime shear. This framework resolves ambiguities in defining Carrollian gravity and provides a robust theory for gravito-magnetic dynamics in ultra-relativistic regimes. Our results have direct implications for the study of black hole horizons, gravitational memory, and the holographic principle.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Decoherence from the Gravitational Floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the decoherence rate of primordial fluctuations within minimal inflationary models, using only the gravitational interactions required for the underlying fluctuation-generation mechanism itself. Since gravity provides the weakest interactions the result provides a plausible floor on the rate of primordial decoherence. Previous calculations (arXiv:2211.11046) did so using only a subset of these interactions, motivated by assuming both system and environment were super-Hubble. We extend this by including the effects on super-Hubble modes of {\it all} gravitational interactions at leading order in H/Mp (and so need not restrict the decohering environment to being super-Hubble). We show how the decohering evolution becomes Markovian for super-Hubble modes, without the need to appeal to truncations (like the `rotating wave' approximation) that are often used in optics but can be inapprorpriate for cosmology. We find that the dominant contribution comes from the nonlocal cubic interactions obtained by solving the constraints. We identify UV divergences systematically and verify thereby that the leading part of the purity evolution is UV finite. In the end we find a decoherence rate that grows in the super-Hubble regime significantly {\it faster} than found earlier. We take the preliminary steps to resum this result to late times and briefly discuss why they are more complicated than for earlier calculations.</description>

      <title>General finite two-loop amplitude integrand for photoproduction in quark annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of integrands free of infrared and ultraviolet singularities may enable the application of numerical methods to evaluate loop amplitudes that are inaccessible with analytic techniques. At two loops, finite amplitude integrands have been constructed for the production of off-shell or massive colorless particles via quark annihilation. In this article, we extend this class of processes to include real photons in the final state.
  To achieve this, we introduce appropriate momentum flows and counterterms to eliminate singularities that occur because the photons are massless. These singularities arise only locally at the integrand level and do not lead to divergences upon integration. Our treatment also eliminates all power singularities arising from self-energy corrections in the integrand. We extend the analysis to gluon emission from virtual quarks. We believe these new insights will be useful for future extensions of infrared subtraction methods to processes with final-state jets.</description>

      <title>Is GW190521 a gravitational wave echo of wormhole remnant from another universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A particularly compelling aspect of the GW190521 event detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration is that it has an extremely short duration, and lacks a clearly identifiable inspiral phase usually observed in the binary black holes (BBHs) coalescence. In this work, we hypothesize that GW190521 might represent a single, isolated gravitational wave (GW) echo pulse from the wormhole, which is the postmerger remnant of BBHs in another universe and connected to our universe through a throat. The ringdown signal after BBHs merged in another universe can pass through the throat of wormhole and be detected in our universe as a short-duration echo pulse. Our analysis results indicate that our model yields a network signal-to-noise ratio comparable to that of the standard BBHs merger model reported by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. Though the Bayesian factor slightly prefers the standard BBHs merger model, it is not significant enough to rule out the possibility that the echo-for-wormhole model is a viable hypothesis for the GW190521 event.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We put forward a novel formulation of the vortex gas model of turbulent circulation statistics to address the challenging case of nonplanar circulation contours. Relying upon a field-theoretical description, statistical moments of the circulation turn out to be functionally dependent on specific {\it{optimal surfaces}} bounded by the circulation loops. Circulation is modeled in the optimal curved spaces with the help of scalar vertex operators that represent the multifractal density fluctuations of Gaussian-correlated vortex structures. We show that minimal surfaces are optimal within the inertial range, but subdominant deviations are expected to become significant for contours with linear dimensions close to the Kolmogorov dissipation length. As a case study, we demonstrate the model's applicability through a Monte Carlo evaluation of the circulation probability distribution function for a nonplanar contour, which is in excellent agreement with results of extensive direct numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Veneziano amplitude of string theory is the unique solution to an analytically solvable bootstrap problem. Uniqueness follows from two assumptions: faster than power-law falloff in high-energy scattering and the existence of some infinite sequence in momentum transfer at which higher-spin exchanges cancel. The string amplitude-including the mass spectrum-is an output of this bootstrap. If the amplitude merely vanishes at high energies, the solution is a three-parameter family containing the Veneziano, Coon, and hypergeometric amplitudes, and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</description>

Abstract: We propose and study a new holographic duality between a non-supersymmetric defect conformal field theory (dCFT) and its gravity dual. On the gravity side, the defect is realised by a novel solution of a D5 probe brane embedded in the $AdS_5\times S^5$ geometry. The D5 brane wraps an $S^2\subset S^5$ and accommodates $k$ units of flux through the $S^2$. The symmetry of the induced on the brane metric is $AdS_3\times S^1\times S^2$. The brane ends on an $\mathbb{R}^{(1,1)}$ subspace of the 4-dimensional $AdS_5$ boundary resulting to a codimension-2 defect. We first prove that our brane configuration is stable by showing that the masses of all the fluctuations of the transverse to the brane coordinates respect the B-F bound. On the field theory side, the 2-dimensional defect is described by a classical solution whose precise form we determine. Subsequently, we calculate the one-point functions of the energy-momentum tensor and of the chiral primary operators (CPOs), first at strong and then at weak coupling. In an appropriate limit, we find compelling agreement between the weak and strong coupling results. Furthermore, we also extract one of the B-type Weyl anomaly coefficients.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian ferromagnets with three-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of nonabelian ferromagnets consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$ and interacting with two-body and three-body interactions. Using a mean field approach, we uncover an intricate phase structure, depending on the relative strength and sign of the two-body and three-body coupling constants. In the case where two-body interactions are ferromagnetic and three-body ones are antiferromagnetic, we uncover a rich cascade of phase transitions, the appearance of phases with two distinct polarization directions being the most striking novel feature. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems where higher-body interactions cannot be neglected.</description>

      <title>On tests for baby universes in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address a puzzle by Antonini and Rath -- where a single CFT state has two bulk duals, one with a baby universe and one without -- Engelhardt and Gesteau recently devised a test for baby universes in AdS/CFT. Using the extrapolate dictionary, they showed that the boundary dual of a bulk swap test favored bulk spacetimes without a baby universe, providing evidence against their semiclassical validity. However, recent work suggests that holographic maps should post-select on such closed universes, and we argue that this is consistent with the extrapolate dictionary. We therefore construct a new holographic map for bulk states with baby universes and use this to show that the swap test cannot distinguish between Antonini and Rath's two candidate bulk duals. This not only allows for a valid semiclassical description of the baby universe, but also enables the application of recent techniques for including observers in holographic maps.</description>

      <title>Continuous spin field in the $\mathbf{AdS_6}$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A representation of the $\mathfrak{so}(2,5)$ algebra corresponding to the continuous spin field in $\mathbf{AdS_6}$ is considered. The algebra is realized using the Lie-Lorentz derivative, which naturally incorporates $\mathbf{AdS_6}$ geometry and spin degrees of freedom. Within this framework, we derive explicit expressions for the Casimir operators in terms of both the covariant derivative and the spin invariants. The continuous spin representation under consideration is defined by a system of operator constraints that generalize those known for six-dimensional Minkowski space. We demonstrate that these constraints completely fix all Casimir operators of the $\mathfrak{so}(2,5)$ algebra, with the eigenvalues determined by a dimensional real parameter $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and a positive (half-)integer $s$.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills Flux Tube in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of flux tubes in confining gauge theories placed in a rigid AdS background, which serves as an infrared regulator. Varying the AdS radius from large to small allows us to interpolate between the flat space confining string, and a weakly coupled string-like object which is held together by the AdS gravitational potential. At any radius, the string preserves a subgroup of AdS isometries equivalent to the one-dimensional conformal group and hence, from the boundary point of view, can be thought of as a conformal defect. The defect hosts a protected operator, called displacement, which nonlinearly realizes the broken AdS isometries. At small radius the displacement corresponds to the gauge field strength inserted at the boundary, while at large radius it is mapped to the Goldstone mode living on the string worldsheet. This relates gauge field and worldsheet degrees of freedom. We propose a hypothesis according to which the large and small radius perturbative expansions can be smoothly matched with each other. As a test, we calculate the leading order corrections to the scaling dimensions and OPE coefficients of a set of defect operators at weak coupling in planar 3D Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>Anomaly cancellation for a $U(1)$ factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use methods of arithmetic geometry to find solutions to the abelian local anomaly cancellation equations for a four-dimensional gauge theory whose Lie algebra has a single $\mathfrak{u}_1$ summand, assuming that a non-trivial solution exists. The resulting polynomial equations in the integer $\mathfrak{u}_1$ charges define a projective cubic hypersurface over the field of rational numbers. Generically, such a hypersurface is (by a theorem of Koll{\'a}r) unirational, making it possible to find a finitely-many-to-one parameterization of infinitely many solutions using secant and tangent constructions. As an example, for the Standard Model Lie algebra with its three generations of quarks and leptons (or even with just a single generation and two $\mathfrak{su}_3\oplus\mathfrak{su}_2$ singlet right-handed neutrinos), it follows that there are infinitely many anomaly-free possibilities for the $\mathfrak{u}_1$ hypercharges. We also discuss whether it is possible to find all solutions in this way.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Criticality of Noncommutative RN-AdS Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by string theory topics, we investigate the Reissner Nordstrom AdS black holes in noncommutative spacetime with Lorentzian smeared distributions. Concretely, we study certain thermodynamic properties including the criticality behaviors by computing the relevant quantities. For large radius approximations, we first derive the asymptotic expansions of the mass and charge functions appearing in the metric function of such black holes. Then, we approach the thermodynamics in the extended phase space. After the stability discussion, we examine the P V criticality in noncommutative geometry by calculating the corresponding thermodynamic quantities. As a result, we show that the proposed black holes exhibit certain similarities with Van der Waals fluid systems. Finally, we present a discussion on the Joule Thomson expansion showing perfect universality results appearing in charged AdS black holes.</description>

      <title>Free-field approaches to boundary $\mathcal{W} \big[ \widehat{g} \big] (p,p') $ minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the background charged bosonic free-field approach to the rational principal quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov (QDS) $\mathcal{W} \big[ \widehat{g} \big](p,p')$ minimal models with boundaries, where $g$ is a simple bosonic Lie algebra. We express their Ishibashi states using the free-field Ishibashi states, and calculate disk two-point correlation functions using the free-field vertex operators with intertwiner insertions. The integral results are obtained by repeatedly applying the Euler-type integral expression and the Taylor expansions of Lauricella's hypergeometric functions $F_{D}^{(n)}$. We also discuss the background free-field approach to the QDS $\mathcal{W} $ algebras related to a semi-simple Lie algebra $g$, and apply a coset free-field resolution to express diagonal ADE coset $\mathcal{W}$ minimal Ishibashi states.</description>

      <title>Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14706v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</description>

      <title>Boundary operator product expansion coefficients of the three-dimensional Ising universality class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in conformal field theory and critical phenomena have focused on the characterization of boundary or defects in a conformally invariant system. In this Letter we study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional Ising universality class in the presence of a surface, realizing the ordinary, the special, and the normal universality classes. By combining high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved model, where leading scaling corrections are suppressed, with a finite-size scaling analysis informed by conformal field theory, we determine unbiased, accurate estimates of universal boundary operator product expansion coefficients of experimental relevance. Furthermore, we improve the value of the scaling dimension of the surface field at the special transition by the estimate $\hat{\Delta}_\sigma = 0.3531(3)$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of turbulent mixing: discrete shell structures in scalar concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for the one-point distribution of a passive scalar in decaying homogeneous turbulence, in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity at fixed Schmidt number. The velocity statistics are governed by the Euler ensemble, obtained previously as a spontaneously stochastic solution to the loop equation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations in the extreme turbulent limit. The resulting advection-diffusion problem is solved explicitly via loop calculus. For an initially localized scalar distribution, the solution develops a sequence of concentric spherical shells with a quantized, piecewise-parabolic radial profile of temperature and a finite limit at the center -- an outcome not predicted by conventional theories. This shell structure is the unique solution of the transport equation within the Euler ensemble, but may be smeared by finite diffusivity or forcing. It represents the geometric skeleton of scalar transport in ideal turbulence, and may be relevant in astrophysical or quantum-fluid regimes where dissipation is negligible. This work redefines expectations for scalar mixing in the high-Reynolds-number limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the addition to the Standard Model of a scalar $SU(2)$ multiplet $\Delta_n$ with dimension $n$ going from $1$ to $6$. The multiplet $\Delta_n$ is assumed to have null vacuum expectation value and an arbitrary (free) hypercharge. We determine the shape of the phase space for the new terms that appear in the scalar potential (SP); we observe in particular that, in the case of a 6-plet, the phase space is slightly concave along one of its boundaries. We determine the bounded-from-below and vacuum stability conditions on the SP for each value of $n$.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity from early-time thermalization of cosmic fluids in light of DESI DR2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If nonrelativistic dark matter and radiation are allowed to interact, reaching an approximate thermal equilibrium, this interaction induces a bulk viscous pressure changing the effective one-fluid description of the universe dynamics. By modeling such components as perfect fluids, a cosmologically relevant bulk viscous pressure emerges for dark matter particle masses in the range of $1\,\text{eV} - 10\,\text{eV}$ keeping thermal equilibrium with the radiation. Such a transient bulk viscosity introduces significant effects in the expansion rate near the matter-radiation equality (redshift $z_{\text{eq}} \sim 3400$) and at late times (leading to a higher inferred value of the Hubble constant $H_0$). We use the recent DESI DR2 BAO data to place an upper bound on the free parameter of the model $\tau_\text{eq}$ which represents the time scale in which each component follows its own internal perfect fluid dynamics until thermalization occurs. Our main result is encoded in the bound $\tau_\text{eq} &lt; 1.84 \times 10^{-10} $ s (2$\sigma$), with the corresponding dimensionless bulk coefficient $\tilde{\xi} H_0/H_\text{eq}&lt;5.94\times10^{-4}$ (2$\sigma$). In practice, this rules out any possible interaction between radiation and dark matter prior to the recombination epoch.</description>
