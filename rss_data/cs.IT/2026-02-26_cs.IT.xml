      <title>The constructions of Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes with minimum distance 6 and locality 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new constructions of $q$-ary Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes (LRCs) with minimum distance $d=6$ and locality $r=3$, based on combinatorial structures from finite geometry. By exploiting the well-known correspondence between a complete set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) of order $q$ and the affine plane $\mathrm{AG}(2,q)$, We systematically construct families of disjoint 4-arcs in the projective plane $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, such that the union of any two distinct 4-arcs forms an 8-arc. These 4-arcs form what we call 4-local arcs, and their existence is equivalent to that of the desired codes. For any prime power $q\ge 7$, our construction yields codes of length $n = 2q$, $2q-2$, or $2q-6$ depending on whether $q$ is even, $q\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, or $q\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Guided Wireless Technology for Near-Field Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided wireless technology is an innovative approach that combines the strengths of guided waves and wireless communication. In traditional wireless systems, signals propagate through the air, where they are vulnerable to interference, attenuation, and jamming. Guided communication, in contrast, confines signals within a physical medium, significantly reducing interference and supporting higher data rates over longer distances. Guided wireless technology harnesses these benefits by creating guided wireless channels and offering a controlled pathway for electromagnetic waves. This work harnesses these benefits by focusing on the modeling of near-field communication through long connected arrays deployed in linear-cell environments. We derive a circuit model for long array as an infinitely long dipole with multiple periodic feed points before approximating it with a finite array through open circuiting. Through our simulations, we show how the standing wave phenomenon is confirmed by the oscillations in spectral efficiency. We also demonstrate the capability of the LMMSE transmit beamformer in mitigating interference and minimizing the mean square error by adaptively allocating more power to the user experiencing the most severe channel attenuation, resulting in a more balanced variation of achievable rates across users.</description>

      <title>Impact of Pointing Errors and Correlated Wall Blockages on Practical Grid-based Indoor Terahertz Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communications has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless systems due to its potential to support extremely high data rates. However, severe path loss, blockage effects, and sensitivity to beam misalignment pose major challenges to reliable indoor THz communications. In this paper, we investigate the coverage probability of downlink transmission in a three-dimensional (3D) indoor THz communication system under structured access point (AP) deployments, with a focus on square and hexagonal grid topologies. A tractable analytical framework is developed to jointly account for human blockages, correlated wall blockages across APs, beam training, and residual pointing error. Numerical results demonstrate that wall blockage correlation significantly reduces the association and coverage probabilities, and its impact cannot be neglected in system performance analysis. Compared with square grid AP deployments, hexagonal grids consistently achieve higher coverage by mitigating correlated wall blockage effects and reducing the distances between user equipments (UEs) and their associated APs. Furthermore, coverage performance is shown to strongly depend on the UE location, with noticeable degradation as the UE moves away from its nearest AP. Residual pointing error is found to introduce substantial coverage loss, especially for longer links. In addition, beam training analysis reveals a non-monotonic relationship between antenna array size and training overhead, highlighting an inherent tradeoff among antenna configuration, beamwidth selection, and beam training efficiency. These findings provide useful insights into the design and deployment of practical indoor THz communication systems.</description>

      <title>Concatenated Sum-Rank Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum-rank codes have wide applications in multishot network coding, distributed storage and the construction of space-time codes. Asymptotically good sequences of linearized algebraic geometry sum-rank codes, exceeding the Gilbert-Varshamov-like bound, were constructed in a recent paper published in IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory by E. Berardini and X. Caruso. We call this bound the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink-like bound. In this paper, we introduce the concatenation of a sum-rank code and a Hamming metric code. Then many sum-rank codes with good parameters, which are better than sum-rank BCH codes, are constructed simply and explicitly. Moreover, we obtain an asymptotically good sequence of sum-rank codes exceeding the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink-like bound and the Gilbert-Varshamov-like bound.</description>

      <title>Permutation Polynomials Under Multiplicative-Additive Perturbations: Characterization via Difference Distribution Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate permutation polynomials F over finite fields F_{p^n} whose generalized derivative maps x -&gt; F(x + a) - cF(x) are themselves permutations for all nonzero shifts a. This property, termed perfect c-nonlinearity (PcN), represents optimal resistance to c-differential attacks - a concern highlighted by recent cryptanalysis of the Kuznyechik cipher variant. We provide the first characterization using the classical difference distribution table (DDT): F is PcN if and only if Delta_F(a,b) Delta_F(a,c^{-1}b) = 0 for all nonzero a,b. This enables verification in O(p^{2n}) time given a precomputed DDT, a significant improvement over the naive O(p^{3n}) approach. We prove a strict dichotomy for monomial permutations: the derivative F(x + alpha) - cF(x) is either a permutation for all nonzero shifts or for none, with the general case remaining open. For quadratic permutations, we provide explicit algebraic characterizations. We identify the first class of affine transformations preserving c-differential uniformity and derive tight nonlinearity bounds revealing fundamental incompatibility between PcN and APN properties. These results position perfect c-nonlinearity as a structurally distinct regime within permutation polynomial theory.</description>

      <title>From Specialist to Large Models: A Paradigm Evolution Towards Semantic-Aware MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) network is expected to deploy larger multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays to support massive connectivity, which will increase overhead and latency at the physical layer. Meanwhile, emerging 6G demands such as immersive communications and environmental sensing pose challenges to traditional signal processing. To address these issues, we propose the ``semantic-aware MIMO'' paradigm, which leverages specialist models and large models to perceive, utilize, and fuse the inherent semantics of channels and sources for improved performance. Moreover, for representative MIMO physical-layer tasks, e.g., random access activity detection, channel feedback, and precoding, we design specialist models that exploit channel and source semantics for better performance. Additionally, in view of the more diversified functions of 6G MIMO, we further explore large models as a scalable solution for multi-task semantic-aware MIMO and review recent advances along with their advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss the challenges, insights, and prospects of the evolution of specialist models and large models empowered semantic-aware MIMO paradigms.</description>

      <title>Function-Correcting Codes with Optimal Data Protection for Hamming Code Membership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates single-error-correcting function-correcting codes (SEFCCs) for the Hamming code membership function (HCMF), which indicates whether a vector in $\mathbb{F}_2^7$ belongs to the [7,4,3]-Hamming code. Necessary and sufficient conditions for valid parity assignments are established in terms of distance constraints between codewords and their nearest non-codewords. It is shown that the Hamming-distance-3 relations among Hamming codewords induce a bipartite graph, a fundamental geometric property that is exploited to develop a systematic SEFCC construction. By deriving a tight upper bound on the sum of pairwise distances, we prove that the proposed bipartite construction uniquely achieves the maximum sum-distance, the largest possible minimum distance of 2, and the minimum number of distance-2 codeword pairs. Consequently, for the HCMF SEFCC problem, sum-distance maximisation is not merely heuristic-it exactly enforces the optimal distance-spectrum properties relevant to error probability. Simulation results over AWGN channels with soft-decision decoding confirm that the resulting max-sum SEFCCs provide significantly improved data protection and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to arbitrary valid assignments.</description>

      <title>Maximal Recoverability: A Nexus of Coding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modern era of large-scale computing systems, a crucial use of error correcting codes is to judiciously introduce redundancy to ensure recoverability from failure. To get the most out of every byte, practitioners and theorists have introduced the framework of maximal recoverability (MR) to study optimal error-correcting codes in various architectures. In this survey, we dive into the study of two families of MR codes: MR locally recoverable codes (LRCs) (also known as partial MDS codes) and grid codes (GCs).
  For each of these two families of codes, we discuss the primary recoverability guarantees as well as what is known concerning optimal constructions. Along the way, we discuss many surprising connections between MR codes and broader questions in computer science and mathematics. For MR LRCs, the use of skew polynomial codes has unified many previous constructions. For MR GCs, the theory of higher order MDS codes shows that MR GCs can be used to construct optimal list-decodable codes. Furthermore, the optimally recoverable patterns of MR GCs have close ties to long-standing problems on the structural rigidity of graphs.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Conflict-Avoiding Codes for Expanded Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conflict-avoiding code (CAC) of length L and weight w is used for deterministic multiple-access without feedback. When the number of simultaneous active users is less than or equal to w, such a code is able to provide a hard guarantee that each active user has a successful transmission within every consecutive L time slots. Recently, CACs were extended to multichannel CAcs (MC-CACs) over M orthogonal channels with the aim of increasing the number of potential users that can be supported. While most existing results on MC-CAC are derived under the assumption that M is not less than w, this paper focuses on the case that M is less than w, which is more relevant to practical application scenarios. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of exceptional codewords in MC-CACs. By employing some techniques from additive combinatorics, we derive a series of optimal MC-CACs. Along the way, several previously known optimal CAC results are generalized. Finally, our results extend naturally to AM-OPPTS MC-CACs and mixed-weight MC-CACs, two classes of relevant codes.</description>

      <title>The Instability of all Backoff Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove Aldous's conjecture from 1987 that there is no backoff protocol that is stable for any positive arrival rate. The setting is a communication channel for coordinating requests for a shared resource. Each user who wants to access the resource makes a request by sending a message to the channel. The users don't have any way to communicate with each other, except by sending messages to the channel. The operation of the channel proceeds in discrete time steps. If exactly one message is sent to the channel during a time step then this message succeeds (and leaves the system). If multiple messages are sent during a time step then these messages collide. Each of the users that sent these messages therefore waits a random amount of time before re-sending. A backoff protocol is a randomised algorithm for determining how long to wait -- the waiting time is a function of how many collisions a message has had. Specifically, a backoff protocol is described by a send sequence $\overline{p} = (p_0,p_1,p_2,\ldots)$. If a message has had $k$ collisions before a time step then, with probability $p_k$, it sends during that time step, whereas with probability $1-p_k$ it is silent (waiting for later). The most famous backoff protocol is binary exponential backoff, where $p_k = 2^{-k}$. Under Kelly's model, in which the number of new messages that arrive in the system at each time step is given by a Poisson random variable with mean $\lambda$, Aldous proved that binary exponential backoff is unstable for any positive $\lambda$. He conjectured that the same is true for any backoff protocol. We prove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa, Reed-Muller codes and Shannon capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1948, Shannon used a probabilistic argument to show the existence of codes achieving a maximal rate defined by the channel capacity. In 1954, Muller and Reed introduced a simple deterministic code construction based on polynomial evaluations, which was conjectured and eventually proven to achieve capacity. Meanwhile, polarization theory emerged as an analytic framework to prove capacity results for a variation of RM codes - the polar codes. Polarization theory further gave a powerful framework for various other code constructions, but it remained unfulfilled for RM codes. In this paper, we settle the establishment of a polarization theory for RM codes, which implies in particular that RM codes have a vanishing local error below capacity. Our proof puts forward a striking connection with the recent proof of the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture [40] and an entropy extraction approach related to [2]. It further puts forward a small orbit localization lemma of potential broader applicability in combinatorial number theory. Finally, a new additive combinatorics conjecture is put forward, with potentially broader applications to coding theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hoeffding's formulation and solution to the universal hypothesis testing (UHT) problem had a profound impact on many subsequent works dealing with asymmetric hypotheses. In this work, we introduce a quantum universal hypothesis testing framework that serves as a quantum analog to Hoeffding's UHT. Motivated by Hoeffding's approach, which estimates the empirical distribution and uses it to construct the test statistic, we employ quantum state tomography to reconstruct the unknown state prior to forming the test statistic. Leveraging the concentration properties of quantum state tomography, we establish the exponential consistency of the proposed test: the type II error probability decays exponentially quickly, with the exponent determined by the trace distance between the true state and the nominal state.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial group testing reduces screening costs and turnaround time but remains challenging to apply due to design complexity, varying applicability, and lack of implementation tools. Here we present PoolPy, a unified end-to-end framework and web platform to benchmark, automate and decode combinatorial group testing strategies tailored to application-specific constraints across assay modalities. We demonstrate PoolPy utility for protein-ligand interaction screening and genome-wide molecular profiling, enabling the scaling up of multi-readout functional assays.</description>

      <title>On Discrete Ambiguity Functions of Random Communication Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a fundamental characterization of the discrete ambiguity functions (AFs) of random communication waveforms under arbitrary orthonormal modulation with random constellation symbols, which serve as a key metric for evaluating the delay-Doppler sensing performance in future ISAC applications. A unified analytical framework is developed for two types of AFs, namely the discrete periodic AF (DP-AF) and the fast-slow time AF (FST-AF), where the latter may be seen as a small-Doppler approximation of the DP-AF. By analyzing the expectation of squared AFs, we derive exact closed-form expressions for both the expected sidelobe level (ESL) and the expected integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under the DP-AF and FST-AF formulations. For the DP-AF, we prove that the normalized EISL is identical for all orthogonal waveforms. To gain structural insights, we introduce a matrix representation based on the finite Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, where each delay-Doppler shift corresponds to a WH operator acting on the ISAC signal. This WH-group viewpoint yields sharp geometric constraints on the lowest sidelobes: The minimum ESL can only occur along a one-dimensional cut or over a set of widely dispersed delay-Doppler bins. Consequently, no waveform can attain the minimum ESL over any compact two-dimensional region, leading to a no-optimality (no-go) result under the DP-AF framework. For the FST-AF, the closed-form ESL and EISL expressions reveal a constellation-dependent regime governed by its kurtosis: The OFDM modulation achieves the minimum ESL for sub-Gaussian constellations, whereas the OTFS waveform becomes optimal for super-Gaussian constellations. Finally, four representative waveforms, namely, SC, OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM, are examined under both frameworks, and all theoretical results are verified through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265</link>

Abstract: Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. This interaction is modeled as a learned optimization with an equilibrium constraint in which the central optimizer learns the utility functions through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations with the goal of identifying a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE). To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate PNE solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</description>

      <title>Graded Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work develops a geometric framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes from weighted projective and orbifold structures, integrating algebraic geometry, divisor theory, and the CSS stabilizer formalism. Beginning with weighted projective spaces and their associated height and defect structures, the study builds classical AG-codes via evaluation on divisors adapted to orbifold singularities. These classical codes are lifted to quantum codes using self-orthogonality conditions and homological constructions, yielding a class of Quantum Weighted Algebraic Geometric (QWAG) codes.
  A central contribution is the formulation of a refined Singleton-type bound motivated by orbifold defect terms and effective genus corrections. While the classical quantum Singleton bound is recovered in the smooth case, the orbifold setting suggests additional geometric contributions that may adjust the theoretical distance bound. The refined bound is presented with partial justification under specific geometric hypotheses and framed as a conjectural extension in full generality.
  The monograph further provides explicit constructions, computational implementations in Sage/Python, and illustrative examples demonstrating how weighted geometry influences code parameters. This work establishes a structured bridge between orbifold geometry and quantum coding theory, outlining both concrete constructions and open problems for further mathematical development.</description>

      <title>Quad Length Codes for Lossless Compression of e4m3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on parallelization and collective operations, which are frequently bottlenecked by network bandwidth. Lossless compression using e.g., Huffman codes can alleviate the issue, however, Huffman codes suffer from slow, bit-sequential decoding and high hardware complexity due to deep tree traversals. Universal codes e.g., Exponential-Golomb codes are faster to decode but do not exploit the symbol frequency distributions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Quad Length Codes, a hybrid approach designed to balance compression efficiency with decoding speed. The coding scheme uses 3 prefix bits to divide the 256 symbols into 8 areas. Each area has a different code length and encodes a different number of symbols. The scheme uses a Look Up Table with 256 entries, significantly simplifying the hardware implementation compared to Huffman trees. The coding scheme can be adapted for different distributions. For the e4m3 data type, the scheme achieves a compressibility of 13.9% in comparison to 15.9% achieved by Huffman codes, but it significantly speeds up the decoding and simplifies the hardware complexity.</description>
