      <title>Search for Dark Matter Annihilation and Decay with H$\alpha$ Line Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a new indirect search for dark matter (DM) using Hydrogen-$\alpha$ (H$\alpha$) recombination emission. DM annihilation or decay products can ionize neutral gas; subsequent recombination cascades generate H$\alpha$ photons through the $3\rightarrow2$ transition. In quiet gas-rich dwarf galaxies, the $n{=}2$ population is negligible, so H$\alpha$ is effectively unabsorbed and traces the DM-energy injection site. Using the non-detection of extended H$\alpha$ emission in the Leo T dwarf galaxy with Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations, I derive the first H$\alpha$-based limits on DM annihilation and decay, reaching leading sensitivity for parts of the eV-GeV mass range. Existing and upcoming telescopes can further extend this reach, establishing H$\alpha$ imaging as a powerful DM search strategy.</description>

      <title>Testing lepton non-unitarity with the next generation of (Germanium-based) CE$\nu$NS reactor experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) has been experimentally confirmed using neutrinos from pion decay at rest, solar neutrinos and reactor antineutrinos. Future CE$\nu$NS experiments will foreseeable lead to precision measurements which will be a powerful tool to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate possible deviations from unitarity in the $3\times3$ leptonic mixing matrix that controls the propagation of active neutrinos. Such deviations may originate from the mixing with additional gauge singlet fermions and depending on their mass scale and mixing, the resulting phenomenology can differ substantially. We explore two well-motivated regimes: the \textit{seesaw limit}, where the new fermions are heavy and kinematically inaccessible, leading to effective deviations from unitarity in the active sector; and the \textit{light sterile limit}, where they are light enough to be produced and participate in neutrino propagation and scattering processes. We show how these scenarios modify both CE$\nu$NS and elastic neutrino--electron scattering (E$\nu e$S), and we present the corresponding sensitivity projections for a future CE$\nu$NS reactor experiment obtained by upscaling the CONUS+ experiment, which reported the first observation of reactor CE$\nu$NS. We identify the leading experimental systematics relevant for such an upscaling and demonstrate the resulting capability to probe TeV-scale new physics. Our results highlight the strong potential of CE$\nu$NS to test the structure of the lepton sector and to search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Dispersive determination of resonances from $\pi\pi$ scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a precise, model- and parametrization-independent dispersive determination of the $f_0(500)$, $\rho(770)$, $f_0(980)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_0(1370)$, $\rho(1450)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $\rho_3(1690)$ resonance pole parameters. They are obtained from the analytic continuation, by means of continued fractions, of forward dispersion relations, whose input is a recent global dispersive analysis of $\pi \pi$ scattering data. From this dispersive study, we find no indications of other resonant poles below 1.7 GeV. Beyond this energy, we also provide resonance pole parameters from the direct analytic continuation of Global Fits to the three existing incompatible data sets. Depending on the data set we find poles for the $\rho(1700)$, $f_0(1710)$, $\rho(1900)$, $f_2(1950)$, and $f_0(2020)$ resonances. We also present the Argand diagrams of these Global Fits and illustrate that each resonance does not necessarily have to trace a full circle in the diagram.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived-Particle Signals of a Composite Hidden Sector through the Neutrino Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the signals of a scenario in which the composite states of a strongly coupled hidden sector couple to the Standard Model through the neutrino portal, giving rise to the neutrino masses. We consider a framework in which the hidden sector is conformal in the ultraviolet and the compositeness scale lies below the weak scale. If the lightest composite state in the hidden sector is a scalar, its decay rate back to the Standard Model is suppressed by angular momentum considerations and can naturally be small, giving rise to long-lived particle signals. We determine the current constraints on this class of models and explore the reach of future collider and beam dump searches. We find that FASER, SHiP, and Belle II can potentially probe a significant part of the unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>A novel two loop inverse seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Standard Model (SM) extension where neutrinos get masses through a two-loop inverse seesaw mechanism. This naturally explains the smallness of the neutrino masses and allows seesaw mediators to be at the TeV scale with testable phenomenology. The model adds two real singlet scalars and four electrically neutral leptons to the SM. The extension considers the existence of two global Abelian symmetries, a continuous $U(1)$ and a discrete $Z_3$. The latter, remains unbroken after spontaneous symmetry breaking and forbids tree-level and one-loop neutrino masses, and stabilizes the dark matter (DM) candidates. This setup accommodates neutrino-oscillation data, yields two pseudo-Dirac heavy pairs with small active-sterile mixing, and predicts an effective Majorana mass $m_{ee}$ in the $2.1$-$4.4$ meV range for normal ordering. Charged-lepton flavor violation is naturally suppressed yet testable: for a representative benchmark we obtain BR$(\mu \to e \gamma)\simeq 1.6 \times 10^{-14}$, with correlated signals in $\mu \to eee$ and $\mu$-$e$ conversion within next-generation experimental reach. Altogether, the radiative origin of neutrino masses links low-energy flavor observables to collider signatures, delineating discovery targets for MEG II, Mu2e/COMET, and the HL-LHC and distinguishing this framework from conventional inverse- and radiative-seesaw models. Moreover, the $Z_3$ guarantees a stable DM candidate, either scalar ($\rho$) or fermionic ($\Omega$). Then, here we analyze and identify the viable parameter space that is consistent with the observed DM relic abundance for both situations.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Dark Matter Relic Density in IDM, MSSM and NMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a computational comparison of relic density predictions for three prominent frameworks Beyond the Standard Model (BSM): the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), the Minimal SuperSymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), and the Next-to-Minimal SuperSymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). Using MicrOMEGAs, we calculate relic densities over varying mass ranges in the low coupling regime. We highlight key differences in each model's behavior relative to current observational bounds and identify viable mass regions. The findings contribute towards guiding model selection based on relic density constraints and suitability.</description>

      <title>Curvaton-assisted hilltop inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we consider hilltop inflation where the inflaton is coupled to a curvaton, simultaneously addressing two main challenges faced by conventional hilltop inflation models: the initial-value problem; and their viability for sub-Planckian field values. In standard single-field hilltop inflation, the inflaton must start extremely close to the maximum of the potential, raising concerns about the naturalness of the initial conditions. We demonstrate that the curvaton field not only solves the initial-value problem, but also opens up parameter space through modifying the curvature perturbation power spectrum, reviving the cubic and quartic hilltop inflation models in the sub-Planckian regime. We find viable parameter space consistent with the recent cosmological observations, and predict a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio that can be tested in the next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments.</description>

      <title>System Energies for Pentaquark Family Using Thomas-Fermi Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study calculates the system energies of families of pentaquarks, $uudc\bar{c}$, starting from 5 quarks up to 70 using Thomas-Fermi statistical quark model. The model assumes spherical symmetry with the particles continuously distributed with varying densities and boundaries. The particles interact with Coulombic forces and a discontinuity in the light quark density function is energetically favored. Total energies of the system are calculated for each multiquark system and compared to determine family stability characteristics. A remarkable stability for multiquark combinations with multiples of four pentaquarks, which we term an icosaquark, is identified. The first icosaquark system is found to have lowest energy per quark, suggesting stability of a system consisting of four charm, four anticharm and twelve light quarks.</description>

      <title>Unfolding quantum entanglement from $h\to ZZ^*\to jj\ell\ell$ at a muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential to study quantum entanglement through Bell-type inequalities in Higgs boson decays at a future muon collider. Our analysis focuses on the channel $\mu^+ \mu^- \to \nu \bar{\nu} h \to \nu \bar{\nu} ZZ^*$, with one $Z$ decaying to charged leptons and the other decaying hadronically into jets. We study the violation of the CGLMP inequality using the optimal Bell operator for the bipartite qutrit system from $h \to ZZ^*$. The entanglement measure $\mathcal{I}_3$ is constructed from spin-correlated angular observables of the $Z$ decay products. An unfolding method on the angular variables is applied to correct for hadronization and detector effects, recovering the advantage of the hadronic mode with higher event yield and reduced uncertainty. The study is performed at 1, 3, and 10 TeV centre-of-mass energies, assuming 10 ab$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity for each case. At 1 TeV, we use a boosted decision tree for signal isolation, while at higher energies, simple cut-based analyses are sufficient. We find clear Bell inequality violation with the expected values $\mathcal{I}_3 = 2.625 \pm 0.012$, $2.623 \pm 0.004$, and $2.582 \pm 0.010$ for the 1, 3, and 10 TeV machines, respectively. Overall, a strong level of entanglement close to the maximum achievable value of 2.9149 for a two-qutrit system can be measured with very small uncertainties due to the large event yield in the hadronic mode.</description>

      <title>Insights into Nucleon Resonances via Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09160v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first baryon resonance was discovered in the early 1950s. The Roper resonance joined the collection ten years later. Today, many baryon resonances are known and more are being discovered. As baryons, these states are the most fundamental three-body systems in Nature. They must all be understood, not just the isolated ground state nucleon. This contribution sketches applications of continuum Schwinger function methods to the baryon resonance problem. Whilst spectroscopy is of value, particular emphasis is placed on resonance electroproduction because transition form factors extracted from electroproduction data provide a keen tool for revealing resonance structure.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic field from chiral plasma instability with sourcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an electron-positron plasma, an imbalance in the number of right- and left-chiral particles can lead to the growth of a helical magnetic field through a phenomenon called the chiral plasma instability (CPI). In the early universe, scattering reactions that violate chirality come into thermal equilibrium when the plasma cools below a temperature of approximately $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. Since these reactions tend to relax any pre-existing chiral asymmetry to zero as the system approaches equilibrium, the standard lore is that primordial magnetogenesis via the CPI is not viable below $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. In this work, we propose that the presence of a source for chirality can allow the CPI to operate even below $80 \, \mathrm{TeV}$, we explore the implications of this scenario, and we derive predictions for the resultant magnetic field helicity using a combination of analytical methods and direct numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Finite $V_{\rm 2\Delta}$ puzzle in low-multiplicity pp collisions from ultra-long-range azimuthal correlations in the string-shoving model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-long range angular correlations have been recently reported by the ALICE collaboration in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV below ${\rm d}N_{\rm ch}/{\rm d}\eta=7$. The measurements have been performed as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity at midrapidity ($N_{\rm ch}$ in $|\eta|&lt;0.8$), which is known to be strongly sensitive to local multiplicity fluctuations. The present work investigates the impact of the event-activity estimator on ultra-long range angular correlations. The study is conducted in the framework of PYTHIA8 with the string shoving mechanism since it gives a non-zero elliptic flow coefficient, $V_{2\Delta}$. The analysis is conducted as a function of $N_{\rm ch}$, the number of parton-parton scatterings ($N_{\rm mpi}$) and flattenicity. Surprisingly, for ultra-long range correlations, pp collisions with $N_{\rm mpi}=1$ (dijets) seems to be the most sensitive to string shoving. The effect diminishes with increasing $N_{\rm mpi}$. While in data, within uncertainties, $V_{2\Delta}$ exhibits a weak multiplicity dependence; the string shoving mechanism gives a $V_{2\Delta}$ that decreases with the increase in $N_{\rm ch}$. The present work therefore supports the picture stating that mechanisms such as string shoving might explain the low multiplicity limit, whereas, hydro becomes relevant in high-multiplicity pp collisions. This work also suggests that flattenicity might be more effective than $N_{\rm ch}$ to better handle non-flow effects.</description>

      <title>Nucleon decays into three leptons: contact contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon number violating (BNV) nucleon decays into three leptons provide a unique probe of BNV interactions beyond the conventional two-body modes involving a single lepton and a light meson. In a previous work [Nucleon decays into three leptons: noncontact contributions, arXiv:2512.02692.], two of us analyzed the noncontact contributions to these decays arising from dimension-6 (dim-6) operators within the low-energy effective field theory (LEFT), and found that they are severely suppressed due to stringent constraints on these dim-6 operators. In this work, we continue this endeavor by systematically investigating the contact contributions originating from dim-9 LEFT operators. We construct a complete basis of dim-9 operators relevant to these processes, and subsequently match them onto chiral perturbation theory to calculate their decay widths. By employing existing experimental data, we derive stringent constraints on the relevant operators. In addition, we present the analysis of an ultraviolet-complete model to demonstrate its connection with our theoretical framework, thereby facilitating further studies of these exotic nucleon decays in upcoming neutrino experiments with large fiducial masses.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and Dark Energy in Three-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses the incorporation of dark matter and dark energy into a new physics model called the Three-Higgs Doublet Model. Dark matter and dark energy are accommodated as CP-even and $Z_2$-odd scalars in their respective inert doublets. By leveraging a $Z_2$ symmetry to suppress certain interactions, we model the behavior of dark matter. Similarly, by imposing a shift symmetry, dark energy can be mimicked within the same framework for the current cosmic epoch. The dark matter relic density is calculated for our model using \texttt{micrOMEGAs}. It is shown that despite the inclusion of dark energy, dark matter relic density can be brought within observational bounds and match existing literature. Furthermore, the one-loop and two-loop Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) were computed using \texttt{SARAH} to ensure radiative stability over a large range of energies. This study lays the groundwork for a future study of dark matter-dark energy interactions in the early universe and the exploration of different early universe dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We improve the theoretical predictions for rare $Z$-boson decays, $Z\to V\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=e$ or $\mu$), where $V$ denotes a heavy vector quarkonium including $J/\Psi$, $\Psi (2S)$, and $\Upsilon (nS)$ with $n=1,2,3$. These processes are thought to be dominated by the electromagnetic fragmentation transition, i.e., $Z\to \gamma^*\ell^+\ell^-$ followed by $\gamma^*\rightarrow V$. The present study includes all of the relevant tree-level Feynman diagrams, which contribute to these decays in the standard model. Our analysis shows that, for the charmonium final states, the fragmentation transition almost saturates the whole contribution and the other diagrams can be neglected; while for the bottomonium final states, the inclusion of other diagrams can increase their branching fractions by $4\%\sim 9\%$. Further investigation of the differential distributions, especially the angular distributions, indicates that forward-backward asymmetries for final leptons in these processes would be zero in the standard model. Therefore, in future experimental facilities with large number of $Z$-boson events accumulated, studies of these rare $Z$ decays may help both to test the standard model and to probe its interesting extensions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Isotopes In Dark Atoms models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study some aspects of the dark atom model. We consider a finite-size nucleus to find the wave functions of the bound state of a stable particle with a charge of $-2n$ and helium-4 $^4He^{++}$. Then we address the problem of calculating the abundance of anomalous isotopes arising from the capture of helium nuclei by dark atoms during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We use an analogy with the proton-neutron capture process to calculate the reaction cross section and thus determine the concentration of OBe nuclei.</description>

      <title>Branching fraction of $\Xi_{bc}^+\to \Xi_{c}^+ J/\psi$ in the final-state-interaction approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of $\Xi_{bc}^{+}\to \Xi_{c}^{+}J/\psi$ is among the most favored modes for searching for bottom-charm baryons. However, its branching fraction has never been studied in theory. In this work, we investigate the branching fraction of $\Xi_{bc}^{+}\to \Xi_{c}^{+}J/\psi$ in the final-state-interaction approach, as it is dominated by the color-suppressed non-factorizable contributions. A similar process, $\Lambda_{b}^{0}\to \Lambda^0 J/\psi$, is used as a control mode to fix the model parameter. Consequently, the branching fraction of $\Xi_{bc}^{+}\to \Xi_{c}^{+}J/\psi$ is predicted to be $(1.55_{-0.42}^{+0.50})\times10^{-4}$. With the production rate of bottom-charm baryons and the detection efficiencies of the final states, it is expected for considerable signal events to observe $\Xi_{bc}^+$ in the near future.</description>

      <title>Reconciling ALP Dark Matter and Electroweak Baryogenesis through First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that an axionlike particle (ALP) can simultaneously generate the baryon asymmetry and constitute dark matter through dynamics triggered by a first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT). In our proposal, the transition briefly reshapes the ALP potential via a temperature-dependent vacuum expectation value of a scalar field $S$, responsible for making the EWPT of first order, inducing a transient mass enhancement of ALP via higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operator(s). This sudden kick generates a large ALP velocity near the onset of EWPT enabling the broadening of relic satisfied parameter space and predict a complementary stochastic gravitational-wave signal from the underlying first-order transition. We further show that the same ALP dynamics can naturally fuel electroweak baryogenesis through its coupling to electroweak anomaly.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Perpendicular Momentum Distributions of Semileptonic Decays: $\bar{B}_s^0\to D_s^+\mu^-\bar\nu$ as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the differential distribution of semileptonic decays with respect to the perpendicular momentum component of the final state hadron. The benefits and shortfalls arising from measurements of these distributions are discussed. Our approach is illustrated on the LHCb measurement of the $\bar{B}_s^0\to D_s^+\mu^-\bar\nu$ decay distribution where the publicly available data by the LHCb experiment is used in an independent phenomenological analysis for the first time. We extract the CKM element $|V_{cb}|$ and information on the shape of the relevant hadronic form factors from the measurement of the binned rate in the perpendicular momentum component of the hadron.</description>

      <title>A Precise $\alpha_s$ Determination from the R-improved QCD Static Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling $\alpha_s$ is extracted with high precision through fits to lattice-QCD data for the static energy. Our theoretical framework is based on R-improving the three-loop fixed-order prediction for the static energy: we remove the $u=1/2$ renormalon and resum the associated large infrared logarithms. Combined with radius-dependent renormalization scales (the so-called profile functions), this procedure extends the range of validity of perturbation theory to distances as large as $\sim 0.5\,$fm. In addition, we resum large ultrasoft logarithms to N$^3$LL accuracy using renormalization-group evolution. Since the standard four-loop R-evolution treats N$^4$LL and higher-order contributions asymmetrically, we also incorporate this potential source of bias in our analysis. Our estimate of the perturbative uncertainty is obtained through a random scan over the parameters controlling the profile functions and the implementation of R-evolution. We analyze how the extracted value of $\alpha_s$ depends on the shortest and longest distances included in the fit, on the details of the R-evolution procedure, on the fitting strategy itself, and on the accuracy of ultrasoft resummation. From our final analysis, and after evolution to the $Z$ pole, we obtain $\alpha^{(n_f=5)}_s(m_Z)=0.1170\pm 0.0009$, a result fully compatible with the world average and with a comparable uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Photon emission by vortex particles accelerated in a linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the photon emission by charged spinless particles with phase vortices and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection in longitudinal electric and magnetic fields within the scalar QED. A realistic wave packet of an electron or ion accelerated by a radio-frequency wave locally feels a constant and spatially homogeneous field, which allows us to develop an effective model for losing the angular momentum of the vortex particle due to photon emission. For the fields typical for accelerator facilities, we find that an effective lifetime of the vortex state greatly exceeds the acceleration time. This proves that the acceleration of vortex electrons, ions, muons, and so forth to relativistic energies is possible in conventional linacs, as well as in the wake-field accelerators with higher field gradients, the OAM losses due to the photon emission are mostly negligible, and that the vortex quantum state is highly robust against these losses.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Diagram Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic nature of perturbative expansions in quantum field theory can arise from the factorial growth in the number of Feynman diagrams with loop order, as with instantons, or from a series of individual diagrams whose values grow factorially, as with renormalon chains in QED. Other classes of diagrams are known also to grow factorially, such as the Hopf series of graphs in $\phi^3$ theory. This Hopf series was studied using Schwinger-Dyson equations and the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees. We review the Hopf algebra approach and show that the same results can be obtained using analytic QFT techniques as with Hopf-algebraic ones. We present an efficient method to extract the asymptotic behavior and thereby generalize the analysis of the Hopf series to other classes of diagrams in other theories. We confront the question of whether these classes correspond to new types of asymptotic growth beyond instantons and renormalons, and find that they appear to be incomplete calculations of what would be renormalons in these theories if all diagrams were included. Although the Hopf algebra approach is not essential to deriving asymptotic behavior from Schwinger-Dyson equations, it does provide some other insights into quantum field theory. We therefore attempt also to provide a map between some relevant aspects of the Hopf algebra and quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos, B-L Symmetry and the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider realizations of a gauged B-L symmetry in the context of the Dark Dimension scenario, where the SM lives on a codimension one brane in 5d spacetime. The B-L can naturally be a bulk gauge symmetery leading to a global symmetry on the SM brane, and have its gauge anomaly canceled by charged bulk modes. This naturally leads to the existence of 3 right-handed neutrinos propagating in the dark dimension. Allowing for Higgsing of B-L by a bulk scalar at the Higgs scale, results in a massive gauge field with $m_{B-L}\sim 100$ GeV and weak coupling $g_{B-L}\sim 10^{-10}$ which is allowed by current bounds. The model also predicts a natural matching $m_\nu\sim m_{KK}\sim\Lambda^{1/4}$, thereby providing a theoretical explanation for the observed coincidence between neutrino masses and the Dark Energy scale. It also predicts a tower of sterile right-handed neutrinos in the $keV$ mass range.</description>

      <title>The ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with extra $SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ gauge symmetry from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</description>

      <title>Notes On de-Sitter Mellin Barnes Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we create a Mellin space method for boundary correlation functions in de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. We demonstrate that the analytic continuation between AdS${}_{d+1}$ and dS${}_{d+1}$ is encoded in a set of simple relative phases using the Mellin-Barnes representation of correlators. It helps us to determine the scalar three-point and four-point functions and their corresponding Mellin-Barnes amplitudes in dS${}_{d+1}$ space using the known results from AdS${}_{d+1}$ space. The Mellin-Barnes representation reveals the analytic structure of boundary correlation functions over all $d$ and scaling dimensions. In the present discussion, the {\it split representation} have been used as an instrumental technique in particularly the evaluation of bulk Witten diagrams and is suitable to obtain the {\it Conformal Partial Wave decomposition} of tree-level exchange in the bulk Witten diagrams. The equivalent adjustment to the cosmological three-point and four-point function of generic external scalars may be further extracted from these results, assuming the weak breakdown of the de Sitter isometries. These findings offer a step towards a more methodical comprehension of de Sitter observables utilising Mellin space techniques at the tree level and beyond.</description>

      <title>Bimetric MOND as a framework for variable-$G$ theories -- local systems and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bimetric MOND (BIMOND) is used as a platform for variable-$G$ theories that have MOND-specific idiosyncrasies. E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\approx 2\pi G$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\approx 2\pi\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e&gt; G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era.</description>

      <title>Dirac vs. Majorana Dark Matter Imprints on Neutron Star Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental character of a fermionic dark matter, whether it is a Dirac or Majorana particle remains a key unresolved issue whose answer would profoundly affect dark-sector phenomenology and detection strategies thereby motivates complementary probes across particle and astrophysical experiments. Compact stars, particularly neutron stars, offer unique astrophysical laboratories for probing such fundamental properties under extreme densities. The presence of a fermionic DM admixed with nuclear matter can modify the equation of state, thereby affecting observable quantities such as the mass-radius (M-R) relation and tidal deformability. In this work, we investigate how the intrinsic particle nature of fermionic DM influences neutron star structure. Within a relativistic mean-field framework extended by a scalar (or Higgs like) portal coupling between DM and nucleons, we construct self-consistent equation of states for both Dirac and Majorana cases and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to obtain stellar configurations. Owing to the difference in internal degrees of freedom, Dirac DM (four degrees of freedom) generally softens the equation of state more strongly than Majorana DM (two degrees of freedom), leading to smaller radii and lower maximum masses. We identify the parameter space consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints, highlighting the potential of compact-star observations to discriminate between Dirac and Majorana dark matter.</description>

Abstract: In this talk, I discussed a 3-dimensional "effective" velocity distribution of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which, instead of the theoretically predicted velocity distribution of "entire" Galactic Dark Matter particles, describes the actual velocity distribution of WIMPs "scattering off" (specified) target nuclei in an underground detector. Based on numerical results carried out by our double Monte Carlo scattering-by-scattering simulation of 3-dimensional elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering, an (asymmetric) "forward-backward asymmetry" was also demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that the time variation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves from pulsars can be used, in cross-correlation with pulsar timing, to probe the chirality of an isotropic gravitational wave background. Here, we show that the expression for the cross-correlation is derived efficiently with the total-angular-momentum formalism and use this framework to extend the formulation to cross-correlation with astrometry. We do so for spin-1 gravitational waves (that may arise in alternative-gravity theories) as well as the general-relativistic spin-2 gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Scintillation response of cryogenic CsI to few-keV and sub-keV nuclear recoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monochromatic neutron emissions from photonuclear sources $^{88}$Y/Be and $^{124}$Sb/Be are employed to obtain the response of pure (undoped) cesium iodide at 80 K. The use of a low-noise, high-quantum-efficiency avalanche photodiode in combination with a novel waveshifter results in a 70 eV analysis threshold. This reach allows to observe signals from sub-keV nuclear recoils originating in neutron scattering. The extracted quenching factor drops much faster towards low energy than the extrapolation of a model developed for room-temperature CsI[Na]. We comment on the impact of our measurement on planned use of cryogenic CsI in neutrino physics and dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Lattice determination of the QCD low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a non-perturbative determination of the scheme- and scale-independent low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$, appearing in the QCD effective chiral Lagrangian at next-to-leading order, by means of lattice QCD simulations with $N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}=2+1$ quark flavors. We adopt staggered fermions and extract $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$ from the pion mass splitting by suitably generalizing the method introduced in [Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 074513] for the Wilson discretization. Adopting 12 gauge ensembles with 3 different values of the pion mass, and 4 different values of the lattice spacing, we are able to achieve controlled extrapolations towards the continuum, infinite volume, and chiral limits. Our final result $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}} \,\times \, 10^3 = 1.98(48)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm stat}}(26)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm syst}} = 1.98(54)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm tot}}$ agrees with and substantially improves on previous determinations.</description>

      <title>Complementary Search of Fermionic Absorption Operators at Hadron Collider and Direct Detection Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instead of the energy recoil signal at direct detection experiments, dark fermion appears as missing energy at hadron colliders. For a fermionc dark sector particle that coupled with quarks and neutrino via absorption operators, its production at collider is accompanied by an invisible neutrino. We study in details the mono-$X$ (photon, jet, and $Z$) productions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We start from the quark-level absorption operators to make easy comparison between the collider and direct detection experiments. In other words, we study the model-independent constraints on a dark fermion with absorption operator. In addition, the interplay and comparison with the possible detection at the neutrino experiments, especially Borexino, is also briefly discussed. We find that light nuclear target can provide the stronger constraints on both spin-dependent and spin-independent absorption operators.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Mountains: current-carrying domain walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks may have formed in the early universe following the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. Notably, several particle physics models predict the existence of current-carrying DWs, which can capture and store particles as zero modes on it. In this study, we demonstrate that gravitational waves (GWs) generated by current-carrying DWs with fermionic zeromodes exhibit a novel feature: an additional peak in the GW spectrum resembling mountains, arising from metastable topological remnants, which we term ``spherons.'' This distinct signature could be detectable in upcoming GW observatories such as LISA and ET. The results suggest that DW networks in beyond Standard Model scenarios could emit GW signals that are significantly stronger and with greater detectability than previously expected.</description>

      <title>Scalar Rayleigh Dark Matter: current bounds and future prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Matter can interact with electroweak gauge bosons via higher-dimensional operators, in spite of being neutral under gauge interactions, much like neutral atoms interact with photons through Rayleigh scattering. This study explores effective interactions between a real scalar Dark Matter particle, singlet under the SM gauge group, and electroweak gauge bosons. We present a comprehensive analysis of current constraints and projected sensitivities from both lepton and hadron colliders as well as direct and indirect detection experiments in testing Rayleigh Dark Matter interactions. We find that, thanks to the complementarity between collider experiments and cosmological probes, thermally produced Rayleigh Dark Matter at the hundreds of GeV scale can be thoroughly tested with the next generation of experiments. For lighter candidates, upcoming forecasts will explore uncharted parameter space, significantly surpassing the thermal Dark Matter benchmark.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Decoherence via Modified Dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in detail the effect of quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillations. We adopt a phenomenological approach that allows us to parametrize the energy dependence of the decoherence effects resulting from the modification of the neutrino dispersion relation. Using the open quantum system framework we derive decoherence parameters, which are usually connected to quantum gravitational effects. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of decoherence on high-energy astrophysical neutrinos among all possible initial source compositions. We find that variation in the flux composition at neutrino telescopes can be a good probe to test such effects. Additionally, we show that a simple extension with heavy sterile neutrino decoherence produces verifiable signatures.</description>

      <title>Mesons in nonlocal model with four-dimensional separable kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the meson properties in the framework of an effective quark model. We start from the Bethe-Salpeter equation choosing the interaction kernel in nonlocal form with the Gaussian meson vertex function, characterized by a meson size parameter $\Lambda_H$. We demonstrate the model's predictive power by applying it to both light and heavy systems. Key results include a calculation of the $\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma$ decay width and the pion transition form factor $F_{\pi\gamma}(Q^2)$, which reproduces experimental data from low to high $Q^2$. We further predict the electromagnetic properties of heavy quarkonia, obtaining the two-photon decay widths of $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$ and the radiative decay widths of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$, all of which show consistency with available data and other theoretical approaches. The model provides a computationally efficient and unified framework for describing mesons from the light to heavy quark sectors.</description>

      <title>Searching for beyond-Standard-Model solar neutrino interactions using directional detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro-pattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) are a class of technologies that enable the full three-dimensional spatial reconstruction of ionisation tracks from nuclear and electron recoils in gas. Anticipating near-future 30 m$^3$-scale time projection chambers with MPGD-based readout, we forecast the sensitivity of such directionally-sensitive low-energy recoil detectors to neutrino interactions beyond the Standard Model. We work in the framework of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSIs), and calculate the combined recoil energy-angle distributions of the electron recoil signal generated by solar neutrinos in atmospheric-pressure He:CF$_4$ gas. We estimate the expected exclusion limits that such an experiment could place on various NSI parameters, as well as the mass and coupling of a new light mediator that interacts with electrons and neutrinos. We find that with an achievable background reduction of around a factor of ten from current estimates for a 30 m$^3$ optical-readout detector using this gas mixture, sensitivity to NSI parameters would already approach Borexino's sensitivity. Directionality also allows for event-by-event neutrino energy reconstruction, which would provide a means to resolve some parameter degeneracies present in the modified neutrino cross section in this formalism. Our results strongly motivate the development of small-scale directionally-sensitive gas detectors for neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Global QCD analysis of spin PDFs in the proton with high-$x$ and lattice constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive global QCD analysis of spin-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs), combining all available data on inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), as well as inclusive weak boson and jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions, simultaneously extracting spin-averaged PDFs and fragmentation functions. Including recent Jefferson Lab DIS data at high $x$, together with subleading power corrections to the leading twist framework, allows us to verify the stability of the PDFs for $W^2 \geq 4$ GeV$^2$ and quantify the uncertainties on the spin structure functions more reliably. We explore the use of new lattice QCD data on gluonic pseudo Ioffe-time distributions, which, together with jet production and high-$x$ DIS data, improve the constraints on the polarized gluon PDF. The expanded kinematic reach afforded by the data into the high-$x$ region allows us to refine the bounds on higher twist contributions to the spin structure functions, and test the validity of the Bjorken sum rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extreme conditions within the supernova core, a high-temperature and high-density environment, create an ideal laboratory for the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Of particular interest are low-energy supernovae, characterized by their low explosion energies, which place strong constraints on the new-physics energy transfer from the core to the mantle. We compute low-energy supernova constraints on lepton-flavor-violating axions and axion-like particles that couple to both electrons and muons. For axion mass above the muon mass, the electron-muon coalescence and the axion decay are dominant production and reabsorption processes, respectively. We find that the low-energy supernovae provide the most stringent constraints on the axions in the mass range of $\sim (110,550)$ MeV, probing the coupling constant down to $g_{ae\mu} \simeq {\cal O}(10^{-11})$.</description>

      <title>Multiple Axions Save High-Scale Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many models of dark matter QCD axion requires inflation at a scale $H_{\text{inf}} \lesssim 10^{6}$~GeV and hence does not allow for a detectable tensor mode fluctuation. This is because the domain wall problem forces the Peccei--Quinn symmetry to be broken during the inflation and the axions to be produced by the misalignment mechanism. We point out that theories with multiple axions can evade this constraint and allow for a high-scale inflation with detectable tensor mode. It only requires a condition on the anomaly coefficients so that there is a unique minimum for the axion potential without a fine-tuning or small parameters.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the mass of Higgs boson through HZ production at FCC-ee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The associated production of a Higgs boson with a $Z$ boson in the collisions of electron and positron beams at Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) have been studied. Here, the $Z$ boson decays into dileptons, while the Higgs boson decays to all possible channels, mostly to the $b\bar{b}$. The collisions provide a clean and powerful channel to probe the ($HZZ$) coupling at future lepton colliders. Following the event generation, the analysis is performed using the recoil mass method, which allows model-independent reconstruction of the Higgs boson depending on the kinematics of the final-state leptons. This method enables precise identification of the Higgs signal peak independent of its decay mode and significantly reduces systematic uncertainties. The recoil mass distributions from the signal process ($e^+e^- \to HZ$, $Z \to l^+l^-$) and the main backgrounds ($ZZ$, $WW$, $t\bar{t}$ and other standard model processes) have been analyzed using a dedicated analysis code. Monte Carlo simulations corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $5$ ab$^{-1}$ have been used for the analysis, assuming the high performance of the IDEA detector concept. The results are presented for center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 240$ GeV and $\sqrt{s} = 365$ GeV to compare the sensitivities and highlight the potential of future $e^+e^-$ colliders in probing the $HZZ$ interaction with high precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate thermal properties of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1$-dimensions through real-time simulations. We extract the spectral functions directly coupling to the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons, demonstrating the thermal modifications of these states with increasing temperatures. Introducing the notion of energy-flow operators, we quantify the temporal build-up of correlations in the energy flows across the lattice. We demonstrate that energy-energy correlators fail to factorize to products of energy flows, both in the vacuum and at nonzero-temperature, indicating the presence of non-trivial correlations in the quantum states. Our results constitute a first real-time \textit{ab-initio} study of bound state thermal broadening and finite temperature energy-flow correlations in a gauge theory, providing a benchmark for future studies of hadronic matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time reversal (T) symmetry violations in neutrino oscillations imply the presence of an $L$-odd component in the transition probability at fixed neutrino energy, with $L$ denoting the distance between neutrino source and detector. Within the standard three-flavour framework, we show that the combination of the transition probabilities determined at the DUNE and T2HK experiments can establish the presence of an $L$-odd component, and therefore provide sensitivity to T violation, up to $4\sigma$ significance. The optimal neutrino energy window is from 0.68 to 0.92 GeV, and therefore a crucial role is played by the low-energy part of the DUNE event spectrum covering the second oscillation maximum. We compare the sensitivity to T violation based on this energy range using neutrino data only with the more traditional search for charge-parity (CP) violation based on the comparison of neutrino versus anti-neutrino beam data. We show that for DUNE it is advantageous to run in neutrino mode only, i.e., searching for T violating effects, whereas T2HK is more sensitive to CP violation, comparing neutrino and anti-neutrino data. Hence, the two experiments offer complementary methods to determine the complex phase in the PMNS mixing matrix.</description>

      <title>Mass spectrum of the $\Omega\bar{\Omega}$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the mass spectrum of the $\Omega\bar{\Omega}$ states with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, $1^{--}$, $0^{++}$, and $1^{++}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. Employing suitably constructed interpolating currents, the analyses are carried out with the operator product expansion (OPE) including condensate contributions up to dimension $12$. Our results indicate the existence of four possible baryonium states with masses $m_{0^{-+}}=(3.22\pm0.07)$ GeV, $m_{1^{--}}=(3.28\pm0.08)$ GeV, $m_{0^{++}}=(3.46\pm0.09)$ GeV, and $m_{1^{++}}=(3.54\pm0.11)$ GeV. For the $0^{-+}$ and $1^{--}$ states, the predicted masses lie below the corresponding dibaryon thresholds, suggesting possible bound-state configurations. In contrast, the $0^{++}$ and $1^{++}$ states are found above the respective thresholds, implying resonance-like behavior. Potential decay channels for these baryonium candidates are discussed, with emphasis on those accessible to current experimental facilities such as BESIII, Belle II, and LHCb.</description>

      <title>Testing the heavy decaying sterile neutrino hypothesis at the DUNE near detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most convincing explanations of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies relies on a heavy, mostly sterile neutrino with a small muon neutrino component, which decays to an electron neutrino and an invisible light scalar field. We investigate the possibility to test this hypothesis at the near detector complex of the upcoming DUNE experiment. We find that the DUNE liquid argon near detector (ND-LAr) can probe a larger region of the parameter space than the Fermilab SBN program, and may help to confirm or reject a possible hint of $\nu_e$ appearance in future MicroBooNE, SBND or ICARUS data. We also argue that it may be possible to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos if this scenario is realized in Nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytic and numerical systematic study of the neutrino mass matrix with one texture zero is presented in a basis where the charged leptons are diagonal. Under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles, the analysis is carried out in detail for the normal and inverted hierarchy mass spectrum. Our study is performed without any approximations, first analytically and then numerically, using current neutrino oscillation data. The analysis constrains the parameter space in such a way that, among the six possible one-texture-zero patterns, only four are favored in the normal hierarchy and, one in the inverted hierarchy, by current oscillation data at the $3 \sigma$ level. Phenomenological implications for the lepton CP-violating phase and neutrino masses are also explored.</description>

Abstract: We perform an analysis of the scalar sector of 3-Higgs doublet models with softly broken $\Delta(54)$ and $\Sigma(36)$ symmetries. We consider the various vacuum expectation value alignments and consider, for each, softly broken terms that deviate the alignment. We check the evolution of the minima, present analytical and numerical results for the lifting of degeneracies of the physical eigenstates, and describe the decays of the states considering any residual symmetries.</description>

      <title>Cosmic domain walls on a lattice: illusive effects of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolution of cosmic domain walls (DWs) settles to the scaling solution, which is often assumed to be independent of initial conditions. However, lattice simulations performed in this work reveal a clear dependence of the scaling DW area on the initial configuration of the sourcing scalar field, specifically, its infrared (IR) properties. Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR modes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the area parameter $\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value $\xi_{max} \approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of non-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary. Assuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one recognizes $\xi \approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally suppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the scaling regime. We demonstrate that ignorance about initial conditions may affect predictions for the energy density of gravitational waves by the factor five. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is also affected by the choice of initial conditions, most notably in the low-frequency part. Likewise, we revisit annihilation of DWs under the influence of a potential bias. It has been previously found in Ref. [19] that the annihilation happens significantly earlier compared to the estimate based on the simple balance between the potential bias and surface energy density. We further support this observation and show that the tendency towards an earlier annihilation gets even stronger upon removing IR modes in simulations.</description>

      <title>Unitary perturbation theory on the light cone using adiabatic switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-cone perturbation theory is a powerful tool for calculating high-energy scattering amplitudes, particularly for quantum particles such as electrons, photons, or protons scattering off heavy nuclei, a process analogous to potential scattering. Central to these computations are the light-cone wave functions of incoming and outgoing particles, representing the projection of dressed initial and final states onto partonic Fock states. The dressed states are obtained by applying an evolution operator in the Dirac picture to bare partonic states, which may be interpreted physically as a time evolution from preparation to interaction. In standard approaches, a non-unitary operator is used, and proper normalization is imposed a posteriori. Here, we systematically develop perturbation theory from a perturbatively unitary evolution operator, using adiabatic switching to regularize the infinite-time limits. This provides a theoretically coherent framework for organizing calculations, reproducing known results entirely diagrammatically without enforcing unitarity by hand. We illustrate the method with a simple quantum mechanical model, enabling calculations to arbitrary perturbative orders, and then evaluate wave functions in field theories quantized on the light cone, focusing on a massive scalar theory with cubic interaction at one-loop accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the helicity correlation of two $\Lambda$ hyperons produced in unpolarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings (SIDIS), with one hyperon detected in the current fragmentation region and the other in the target fragmentation region. This observable provides direct access to the spin-dependent fragmentation function $G_{1Lq}$ and the spin-dependent fracture function $l_{1q}^L$ even in unpolarized lepton nucleon collisions. Utilizing the perturbative matching of the fracture function, we present numerical predictions for the helicity correlation, revealing significant variations with flavor and kinematic regions. This observable offers a unique way to investigate the spin-dependent hadronization mechanism across both the current and target fragmentation regions. It also provides new insights into the spin transfer effects in SIDIS processes.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Leptogenesis -- an EFT-Consistent Analysis via Wilson Coefficients. Part II. Low-Scale, Resonant Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic leptogenesis (EMLG) in the low-scale, resonant regime within a fully effective-field-theory (EFT)--consistent framework. Starting from a UV Lagrangian and performing a one-loop matching to obtain the gauge-invariant dipole operator $O_{NB}$ with its Wilson coefficient $C_{NB}$, we implement the Pilaftsis--Underwood resummation for the self-energy contributions to the CP asymmetries and evolve a flavour covariant transport system across the electroweak window. In the quasi-degenerate limit $M_m-M_i\simeq\varGamma_m/2$, the CP-odd source acquires a Breit--Wigner--form enhancement whereas the washout saturates, with the freeze-out baryon asymmetry achieving $Y_B^{\rm FO}\gtrsim 10^{-10}$ across the strong-washout regime, comfortably above the observed value $Y_B^{\rm obs}\simeq 8.7\times 10^{-11}$. This establishes resonant EMLG at $O(100)~{\rm GeV}$ as a viable EFT-based mechanism for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Strong Decays of the Light Exotic $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ Hybrid Mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model of hybrid meson structure based on the QCD Hamiltonian in Coulomb gauge and the use of a single constituent quasigluon is applied compute hadronic decays of mesons with exotic quantum numbers, $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$. These correspond to hybrid mesons in which the gluon couples to a $q\bar{q}$ pair in an $P$-wave and can therefore be identified as orbital excitations of the exotic $1^{-+}$ state. Interestingly, we find $0^{+-}$ states to be narrow, contrary to what was found by previous calculations. This is primarily due to the suppression of the decay mode $0^{+-}\rightarrow 2^1S_0+1^1S_0$, which is unique to our model. The $2^{+-}$ states are found to be narrow, as expected.</description>

      <title>Scattering amplitudes versus potentials in nuclear effective field theory: search for a potential compromise</title>

      <description>arXiv:1902.08172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In effective field theory physical quantities, in particular observables, are expressed as a power series in terms of a small expansion parameter. For non-perturbative systems, for instance nuclear physics, this requires the non-perturbative treatment of at least part of the interaction (or the potential, if one is dealing with a non-relativistic system), while the rest of the interaction is included as perturbations. This is not entirely trivial and as a consequence different interpretations on how to treat these systems have appeared. A practical approach is to expand the effective potential, where this potential is later fully iterated in the Schroedinger equation for obtaining amplitudes and observables. The expectation is that this will lead to observables that will have an implicit power counting expansion. Here I explicitly check whether the amplitudes (when expanded according to the counting) are actually following the same power counting as the potential. It happens that reality does not necessarily conform to expectations and the amplitudes will sometimes violate the power counting with which the potential has been expanded. A more formal approach is to formulate the expansion directly in terms of amplitudes and observables, which is the original aim of the effective field theory idea. Yet this second approach is technically complicated. I explore here the possibility of constructing potentials that when fully iterated will make sure that amplitudes are indeed expansible in terms of a small expansion parameter.</description>

      <title>On priors and scale cuts in EFT-based full-shape analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation from galaxy survey data from the full-shape method depends on scale cuts and priors on EFT parameters. The effects of priors, including the so-called ''prior volume'' phenomenon have been originally studied in Ivanov et al. (2019) and subsequent works. In this note, we repeat and extend these tests and also apply them to other priors used in the literature. We point out that in addition to the ''prior volume'' effect there is a more dangerous effect that is largely overlooked: a systematic bias on cosmological parameters due to overoptimistic scale cuts. Unlike the ''prior volume'' effect, this is a genuine systematic bias due to two-loop corrections that does not vanish with better priors or with larger data volumes. Our study is based on the high fidelity BOSS-like PT Challenge simulation data which offer many advantages over analyses based on synthetic data generated with fitting pipelines. We show that some analysis choices associated with the PyBird code, especially the scale cuts, significantly bias parameter recovery, overestimating $\sigma_8$ by over $5\%$ (equivalent to $1\sigma$). The bias on measured EFT parameters is even more significant. In contrast, the analysis choices associated with the CLASS-PT code lead to much smaller ($\lesssim 1\%$) shifts in cosmological parameters based on their best-fit values.</description>

      <title>A rich structure of renormalization group flows for Higgs-like models in 4 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $2$ coupled Higgs doublets which transform in the usual way under SU(2)$\otimes$U(1). By constructing marginal operators which satisfy an operator product expansion based on the SU(2) Lie algebra, we can obtain a rich pattern of renormalization group (RG) flows which includes lines of fixed points and more interestingly, cyclic RG flows which are unavoidable in this model. The hamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}^\dagger $ with ${\cal K}$ unitary satisfying ${\cal K}^2 =1$, thus the model is non-unitary. The hamiltonian still has real eigenvalues, but the non-unitarity is manifested in negative norm states. Based on a generalized optical theorem for pseudo-hermitian hamiltonians, we show that our model is in fact unitary below the threshold for particle/anti-particle pair production. It is thus unitary in the low energy or non-relativistic limit, which opens up some potential applications to condensed matter physics. We argue that our model breaks ${\cal C} {\cal P}$ symmetry. Upon spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs-like fields have an infinite number of vacuum expectation values $v_n$ which satisfy ``Russian Doll" scaling $v_n \sim e^{2 n \lambda}$ where $n=1,2,3,\ldots$ and $\lambda$ is the period of one RG cycle which is an RG invariant. We speculate that this Russian Doll RG flow can perhaps resolve the so-called hierarchy problem and may shed light on the origin of ``families" in the Standard Model of particle physics. If the cyclic RG flow terminates at the electroweak scale, this could explain why there are 3 families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the nuclear equation-of-state (EoS) is a one of the primary goals of experimental and theoretical heavy-ion physics. The comparison of recent high statistics data from the STAR Collaboration with transport models provides a unique possibility to address this topic in a yet unexplored energy domain. Employing the microscopic N-body Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) transport approach, which allows to describe the propagation and interactions of hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom including cluster and hyper-nucleus formation and dynamics, we investigate the influence of different EoS on bulk observables, the multiplicity, $p_T$ and rapidity distributions of protons, $\Lambda$s and clusters up to A=4 as well as their influence on the collective flow. We explore three different EoS: two static EoS, dubbed 'soft' and 'hard', which differ in the compressibility modulus, as well as a soft momentum dependent EoS. We find that a soft momentum dependent EoS reproduces most baryon and cluster observables, including the flow observables, quantitatively, however, hard EOS show a similar trend.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by Circular and Triangular Apertures as a Diagnostic Tool of Twisted Matter Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\ell/\hbar=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.</description>

Abstract: Following its launch on 2024 January 9, the Einstein Probe (EP) telescope has detected hundreds of fast X-ray transients (FXTs), yet their physical origins remain elusive. Understanding their luminosity function and formation rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Recently, the EP team has provided the latest catalog of EP-detected FXTs. Based on this catalog, we present a model-independent nonparametric approach to derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{46}$ erg/s. The formation rate exhibits a broken power law as $\rho(z) \propto (1+z)^{-4.25}$ at $z \lessapprox 0.9$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1+z)^{-0.26}$ at $z \gtrapprox 0.9$, yielding a local rate of approximately $153.8_{-95.1}^{+249.4}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is higher than that of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Our findings indicate that a component of FXTs is associated with LGRBs.</description>
