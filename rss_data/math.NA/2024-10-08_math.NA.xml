      <title>Projected Walk on Spheres: A Monte Carlo Closest Point Method for Surface PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present projected walk on spheres (PWoS), a novel pointwise and discretization-free Monte Carlo solver for surface PDEs with Dirichlet boundaries, as a generalization of the walk on spheres method (WoS) [Muller 1956; Sawhney and Crane 2020]. We adapt the recursive relationship of WoS designed for PDEs in volumetric domains to a volumetric neighborhood around the surface, and at the end of each recursion step, we project the sample point on the sphere back to the surface. We motivate this simple modification to WoS with the theory of the closest point extension used in the closest point method. To define the valid volumetric neighborhood domain for PWoS, we develop strategies to estimate the local feature size of the surface and to compute the distance to the Dirichlet boundaries on the surface extended in their normal directions. We also design a mean value filtering method for PWoS to improve the method's efficiency when the surface is represented as a polygonal mesh or a point cloud. Finally, we study the convergence of PWoS and demonstrate its application to graphics tasks, including diffusion curves, geodesic distance computation, and wave propagation animation. We show that our method works with various types of surfaces, including a surface of mixed codimension.</description>

      <title>Embrace rejection: Kernel matrix approximation by accelerated randomly pivoted Cholesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) is an algorithm for constructing a low-rank approximation of a positive-semidefinite matrix using a small number of columns. This paper develops an accelerated version of RPCholesky that employs block matrix computations and rejection sampling to efficiently simulate the execution of the original algorithm. For the task of approximating a kernel matrix, the accelerated algorithm can run over $40\times$ faster. The paper contains implementation details, theoretical guarantees, experiments on benchmark data sets, and an application to computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of CROP-Anderson Acceleration Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson Acceleration is a well-established method that allows to speed up or encourage convergence of fixed-point iterations. It has been successfully used in a variety of applications, in particular within the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) iteration method for quantum chemistry and physics computations. In recent years, the Conjugate Residual with OPtimal trial vectors (CROP) algorithm was introduced and shown to have a better performance than the classical Anderson Acceleration with less storage needed. This paper aims to delve into the intricate connections between the classical Anderson Acceleration method and the CROP algorithm. Our objectives include a comprehensive study of their convergence properties, explaining the underlying relationships, and substantiating our findings through some numerical examples. Through this exploration, we contribute valuable insights that can enhance the understanding and application of acceleration methods in practical computations, as well as the developments of new and more efficient acceleration schemes.</description>

      <title>High order ADER-DG method with local DG predictor for solutions of differential-algebraic systems of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical method ADER-DG with a local DG predictor for solving a DAE system has been developed, which was based on the formulation of ADER-DG methods using a local DG predictor for solving ODE and PDE systems. The basis functions were chosen in the form of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials, which differs from the classical formulations of the ADER-DG method, where it is customary to use the roots of Legendre polynomials. It was shown that the use of this basis leads to A-stability and L1-stability in the case of using the DAE solver as ODE solver. The numerical method ADER-DG allows one to obtain a highly accurate numerical solution even on very coarse grids, with a step greater than the main characteristic scale of solution variation. The local discrete time solution can be used as a numerical solution of the DAE system between grid nodes, thereby providing subgrid resolution even in the case of very coarse grids. The classical test examples were solved by developed numerical method ADER-DG. With increasing index of the DAE system, a decrease in the empirical convergence orders p is observed. An unexpected result was obtained in the numerical solution of the stiff DAE system -- the empirical convergence orders of the numerical solution obtained using the developed method turned out to be significantly higher than the values expected for this method in the case of stiff problems. It turns out that the use of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials is much better suited for solving stiff problems. Estimates showed that the computational costs of the ADER-DG method are approximately comparable to the computational costs of implicit Runge-Kutta methods used to solve DAE systems. Methods were proposed to reduce the computational costs of the ADER-DG method.</description>

      <title>GraHTP: A Provable Newton-like Algorithm for Sparse Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the sparse phase retrieval problem, which aims to recover a sparse signal from a system of quadratic measurements. In this work, we propose a novel non-convex algorithm, termed Gradient Hard Thresholding Pursuit (GraHTP), for sparse phase retrieval with complex sensing vectors. GraHTP is theoretically provable and exhibits high efficiency, achieving a quadratic convergence rate after a finite number of iterations, while maintaining low computational complexity per iteration. Numerical experiments further demonstrate GraHTP's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Meshfree Method for Eigenvalues of Differential Operators on Surfaces, Including Steklov Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and study techniques for investigating the spectra of linear differential operators on surfaces and flat domains using symmetric meshfree methods: meshfree methods that arise from finding norm-minimizing Hermite-Birkhoff interpolants in a Hilbert space. Meshfree methods are desirable for surface problems due to the increased difficulties associated with mesh creation and refinement on curved surfaces. While meshfree methods have been used for solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs) in recent years, the spectra of operators discretized using radial basis functions (RBFs) often suffer from the presence of non-physical eigenvalues (spurious modes). This makes many RBF methods unhelpful for eigenvalue problems. We provide rigorously justified processes for finding eigenvalues based on results concerning the norm of the solution in its native space; specifically, only PDEs with solutions in the native space produce numerical solutions with bounded norms as the fill distance approaches zero. For certain problems, we prove that eigenvalue and eigenfunction estimates converge at a high-order rate. The technique we present is general enough to work for a wide variety of problems, including Steklov problems, where the eigenvalue parameter is in the boundary condition. Numerical experiments for a mix of standard and Steklov eigenproblems on surfaces with and without boundary, as well as flat domains, are presented, including a Steklov-Helmholtz problem.</description>

      <title>HaTT: Hadamard avoiding TT recompression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hadamard product of tensor train (TT) tensors is one of the most fundamental nonlinear operations in scientific computing and data analysis. Due to its tendency to significantly increase TT ranks, the Hadamard product presents a major computational challenge in TT tensor-based algorithms. Therefore, it is essential to develop recompression algorithms that mitigate the effects of this rank increase. Existing recompression algorithms require an explicit representation of the Hadamard product, resulting in high computational and storage complexity. In this work, we propose the Hadamard avoiding TT recompression (HaTT) algorithm. Leveraging the structure of the Hadamard product in TT tensors and its Hadamard product-free property, the overall complexity of the HaTT algorithm is significantly lower than that of existing TT recompression algorithms. This is validated through complexity analysis and several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Total positivity and accurate computations related to $q$-Abel polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attainment of accurate numerical solutions of ill-conditioned linear algebraic problems involving totally positive matrices has been gathering considerable attention among researchers over the last years. In parallel, the interest of $q$-calculus has been steadily growing in the literature. In this work the $q$-analogue of the Abel polynomial basis is studied. The total positivity of the matrix of change of basis between monomial and $q$-Abel bases is characterized, providing its bidiagonal factorization. Moreover, well-known high relative accuracy results of Vandermonde matrices corresponding to increasing positive nodes are extended to the decreasing negative case. This further allows to solve with high relative accuracy several algebraic problems concerning collocation, Wronskian and Gramian matrices of $q$-Abel polynomials. Finally, a series of numerical tests support the presented theoretical results and illustrate the goodness of the method where standard approaches fail to deliver accurate solutions.</description>

      <title>Numerical Solution for Nonlinear 4D Variational Data Assimilation (4D-Var) via ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) has emerged as an important methodology, widely used in numerical weather prediction, oceanographic modeling, and climate forecasting. Classical unconstrained gradient-based algorithms often struggle with local minima, making their numerical performance highly sensitive to the initial guess. In this study, we exploit the separable structure of the 4D-Var problem to propose a practical variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), referred to as the linearized multi-block ADMM with regularization. Unlike classical first-order optimization methods that primarily focus on initial conditions, our approach derives the Euler-Lagrange equation for the entire dynamical system, enabling more comprehensive and effective utilization of observational data. When the initial condition is poorly chosen, the arg min operation steers the iteration towards the observational data, thereby reducing sensitivity to the initial guess. The quadratic subproblems further simplify the solution process, while the parallel structure enhances computational efficiency, especially when utilizing modern hardware. To validate our approach, we demonstrate its superior performance using the Lorenz system, even in the presence of noisy observational data. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the linearized multi-block ADMM with regularization in solving the 4D-Var problems for the viscous Burgers' equation, across various numerical schemes, including finite difference, finite element, and spectral methods. Finally, we illustrate the recovery of dynamics under noisy observational data in a 2D turbulence scenario, particularly focusing on vorticity concentration, highlighting the robustness of our algorithm in handling complex physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>The Fourier Cosine Method for Discrete Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous convergence proof demonstrating that the well-known semi-analytical Fourier cosine (COS) formula for the inverse Fourier transform of continuous probability distributions can be extended to discrete probability distributions, with the help of spectral filters. We establish general convergence rates for these filters and further show that several classical spectral filters achieve convergence rates one order faster than previously recognized in the literature on the Gibbs phenomenon. Our numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical convergence results. Additionally, we illustrate the computational speed and accuracy of the discrete COS method with applications in computational statistics and quantitative finance. The theoretical and numerical results highlight the method's potential for solving problems involving discrete distributions, particularly when the characteristic function is known, allowing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to be bypassed.</description>

      <title>Support Graph Preconditioners for Off-Lattice Cell-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-lattice agent-based models (or cell-based models) of multicellular systems are increasingly used to create in-silico models of in-vitro and in-vivo experimental setups of cells and tissues, such as cancer spheroids, neural crest cell migration, and liver lobules. These applications, which simulate thousands to millions of cells, require robust and efficient numerical methods. At their core, these models necessitate the solution of a large friction-dominated equation of motion, resulting in a sparse, symmetric, and positive definite matrix equation. The conjugate gradient method is employed to solve this problem, but this requires a good preconditioner for optimal performance. In this study, we develop a graph-based preconditioning strategy that can be easily implemented in such agent-based models. Our approach centers on extending support graph preconditioners to block-structured matrices. We prove asymptotic bounds on the condition number of these preconditioned friction matrices. We then benchmark the conjugate gradient method with our support graph preconditioners and compare its performance to other common preconditioning strategies.</description>

      <title>The role of interface boundary conditions and sampling strategies for Schwarz-based coupling of projection-based reduced order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates a framework for the coupling of subdomain-local projection-based reduced order models (PROMs) using the Schwarz alternating method following a domain decomposition (DD) of the spatial domain on which a given problem of interest is posed. In this approach, the solution on the full domain is obtained via an iterative process in which a sequence of subdomain-local problems are solved, with information propagating between subdomains through transmission boundary conditions (BCs). We explore several new directions involving the Schwarz alternating method aimed at maximizing the method's efficiency and flexibility, and demonstrate it on three challenging two-dimensional nonlinear hyperbolic problems: the shallow water equations, Burgers' equation, and the compressible Euler equations. We demonstrate that, for a cell-centered finite volume discretization and a non-overlapping DD, it is possible to obtain a stable and accurate coupled model utilizing Dirichlet-Dirichlet (rather than Robin-Robin or alternating Dirichlet-Neumann) transmission BCs on the subdomain boundaries. We additionally explore the impact of boundary sampling when utilizing the Schwarz alternating method to couple subdomain-local hyper-reduced PROMs. Our numerical results suggest that the proposed methodology has the potential to improve PROM accuracy by enabling the spatial localization of these models via domain decomposition, and achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup over equivalent coupled full order model solutions and moderate speedups over analogous monolithic solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we delve into further study of numerical approximations of SDEs with non-globally monotone coefficients. We design and analyze a new family of stopped increment-tamed time discretization schemes of Euler, Milstein and order 1.5 type for such SDEs. By formulating a novel unified framework, the proposed methods are shown to possess the exponential integrability properties, which are crucial to recovering convergence rates in the non-global monotone setting. Armed with such exponential integrability properties and by the arguments of perturbation estimates, we successfully identify the optimal strong convergence rates of the aforementioned methods in the non-global monotone setting. Numerical experiments are finally presented to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Artificial Barriers for stochastic differential equations and for construction of Boundary-preserving schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the novel method of artificial barriers for scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and use it to construct boundary-preserving numerical schemes for strong approximations of scalar SDEs, possibly with non-globally Lipschitz drift and diffusion coefficients, whose state-space is either bounded or half-bounded. The idea of artificial barriers is to augment the SDE with artificial barriers outside the state-space to not change the solution process, and then apply a boundary-preserving numerical scheme to the resulting reflected SDE (RSDE). This enables us to construct boundary-preserving numerical schemes with the same strong convergence rate as the strong convergence rate of the numerical scheme for the corresponding RSDE. Based on the method of artificial barriers, we construct two boundary-preserving schemes that we call the Artificial Barrier Euler-Maruyama (ABEM) scheme and the Artificial Barrier Euler-Peano (ABEP) scheme. We provide numerical experiments for the ABEM scheme and the numerical results agree with the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous works show convergence of rational Chebyshev approximants to the Pad\'e approximant as the underlying domain of approximation shrinks to the origin. In the present work, the asymptotic error and interpolation properties of rational Chebyshev approximants are studied in such settings. Namely, the point-wise error of Chebyshev approximants is shown to approach a Chebyshev polynomial multiplied by the asymptotically leading order term of the error of the Pad\'e approximant, and similar results hold true for the uniform error and Chebyshev constants. Moreover, rational Chebyshev approximants are shown to attain interpolation nodes which approach scaled Chebyshev nodes in the limit. Main results are formulated for interpolatory best approximations and apply for complex Chebyshev approximation as well as real Chebyshev approximation to real functions and unitary best approximation to the exponential function.</description>

      <title>Shear-flexible geometrically exact beam element based on finite differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed two-dimensional geometrically exact beam element extends our previous work by including the effects of shear distortion, and also of distributed forces and moments acting along the beam. The general flexibility-based formulation exploits the kinematic equations combined with the inverted sectional equations and the integrated form of equilibrium equations. The resulting set of three first-order differential equations is discretized by finite differences and the boundary value problem is converted into an initial value problem using the shooting method. Due to the special structure of the governing equations, the scheme remains explicit even though the first derivatives are approximated by central differences, leading to high accuracy. The main advantage of the adopted approach is that the error can be efficiently reduced by refining the computational grid used for finite differences at the element level while keeping the number of global degrees of freedom low. The efficiency is also increased by dealing directly with the global centerline coordinates and sectional inclination with respect to global axes as the primary unknowns at the element level, thereby avoiding transformations between local and global coordinates. Two formulations of the sectional equations, referred to as the Reissner and Ziegler models, are presented and compared. In particular, stability of an axially loaded beam/column is investigated and the connections to the Haringx and Engesser stability theories are discussed. Both approaches are tested in a series of numerical examples, which illustrate (i) high accuracy with quadratic convergence when the spatial discretization is refined, (ii) easy modeling of variable stiffness along the element (such as rigid joint offsets), (iii) efficient and accurate characterization of the buckling and post-buckling behavior.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for Schr{\"o}dinger operators discretized with linear combinations of atomic orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish guaranteed and practically computable a posteriori error bounds for source problems and eigenvalue problems involving linear Schr{\"o}dinger operators with atom-centered potentials discretized with linear combinations of atomic orbitals. We show that the energy norm of the discretization error can be estimated by the dual energy norm of the residual, that further decomposes into atomic contributions, characterizing the error localized on atoms. Moreover, we show that the practical computation of the dual norms of atomic residuals involves diagonalizing radial Schr{\"o}dinger operators which can easily be precomputed in practice. We provide numerical illustrations of the performance of such a posteriori analysis on several test cases, showing that the error bounds accurately estimate the error, and that the localized error components allow for optimized adaptive basis sets.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity helps the convergence of the inverse Born series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work of the authors, we investigated the Born and inverse Born series for a scalar wave equation with linear and nonlinear terms, the nonlinearity being cubic of Kerr type [8]. We reported conditions which guarantee convergence of the inverse Born series, enabling recovery of the coefficients of the linear and nonlinear terms. In this work, we show that if the coefficient of the linear term is known, an arbitrarily strong Kerr nonlinearity can be reconstructed, for sufficiently small data. Additionally, we show that similar convergence results hold for general polynomial nonlinearities. Our results are illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Robust Discontinuous Galerkin Methods Maintaining Physical Constraints for General Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) presents challenges such as handling curved spacetime, achieving high-order shock-capturing accuracy, and preserving key physical constraints (positive density, pressure, and subluminal velocity) under nonlinear coupling. This paper introduces high-order, physical-constraint-preserving, oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (PCP-OEDG) schemes with Harten-Lax-van Leer flux for GRHD. To suppress spurious oscillations near discontinuities, we incorporate a computationally efficient oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure based on a linear damping equation, maintaining accuracy and avoiding complex characteristic decomposition. To enhance stability and robustness, we construct PCP schemes using the W-form of GRHD equations with Cholesky decomposition of the spatial metric, addressing the non-equivalence of admissible state sets in curved spacetime. We rigorously prove the PCP property of cell averages via technical estimates and the Geometric Quasi-Linearization (GQL) approach, which transforms nonlinear constraints into linear forms. Additionally, we present provably convergent PCP iterative algorithms for robust recovery of primitive variables, ensuring physical constraints are satisfied throughout. The PCP-OEDG method is validated through extensive tests, demonstrating its robustness, accuracy, and capability to handle extreme GRHD scenarios involving strong shocks, high Lorentz factors, and intense gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>A nodally bound-preserving discontinuous Galerkin method for the drift-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce and analyse discontinuous Galerkin (dG) methods for the drift-diffusion model. We explore two dG formulations: a classical interior penalty approach and a nodally bound-preserving method. Whilst the interior penalty method demonstrates well-posedness and convergence, it fails to guarantee non-negativity of the solution. To address this deficit, which is often important to ensure in applications, we employ a positivity-preserving method based on a convex subset formulation, ensuring the non-negativity of the solution at the Lagrange nodes. We validate our findings by summarising extensive numerical experiments, highlighting the novelty and effectiveness of our approach in handling the complexities of charge carrier transport.</description>

      <title>Constructing probing functions for direct sampling methods for inverse scattering problems with limited-aperture data: finite space framework and deep probing network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies an inverse scattering problem when limited-aperture data are available that are from just one or a few incident fields. This inverse problem is highly ill-posed due to the limited receivers and a few incident fields employed. Solving inverse scattering problems with limited-aperture data is important in applications as collecting full data is often either unrealistic or too expensive. The direct sampling methods (DSMs) with full-aperture data can effectively and stably estimate the locations and geometric shapes of the unknown scatterers with a very limited number of incident waves. However, a direct application of DSMs to the case of limited receivers would face the resolution limit. To break this limitation, we propose a finite space framework with two specific schemes, and an unsupervised deep learning strategy to construct effective probing functions for the DSMs in the case with limited-aperture data. Several representative numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate and compare the performance of different proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Generative Reduced Basis Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generative reduced basis (RB) approach to construct reduced order models for parametrized partial differential equations. Central to this approach is the construction of generative RB spaces that provide rapidly convergent approximations of the solution manifold. We introduce a generative snapshot method to generate significantly larger sets of snapshots from a small initial set of solution snapshots. This method leverages multivariate nonlinear transformations to enrich the RB spaces, allowing for a more accurate approximation of the solution manifold than commonly used techniques such as proper orthogonal decomposition and greedy sampling. The key components of our approach include (i) a Galerkin projection of the full order model onto the generative RB space to form the reduced order model; (ii) a posteriori error estimates to certify the accuracy of the reduced order model; and (iii) an offline-online decomposition to separate the computationally intensive model construction, performed once during the offline stage, from the real-time model evaluations performed many times during the online stage. The error estimates allow us to efficiently explore the parameter space and select parameter points that maximize the accuracy of the reduced order model. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the generative RB method not only improves the accuracy of the reduced order model but also provides tight error estimates.</description>

      <title>Provably Positivity-Preserving Constrained Transport (PPCT) Second-Order Scheme for Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a robust and efficient second-order positivity-preserving constrained transport (PPCT) scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on non-staggered Cartesian meshes. The PPCT scheme ensures two critical physical constraints: a globally discrete divergence-free (DDF) condition on the magnetic field and the positivity of density and pressure. The method is inspired by a novel splitting technique from [T.A. Dao, M. Nazarov and I. Tomas, J. Comput. Phys., 508:113009, 2024], which divides the MHD system into an Euler subsystem with steady magnetic fields and a magnetic subsystem with steady density and internal energy. To achieve these structure-preserving properties, the PPCT scheme combines a positivity-preserving (PP) finite volume method for the Euler subsystem with a finite difference constrained transport (CT) method for the magnetic subsystem via Strang splitting. The finite volume method employs a new PP limiter that retains second-order accuracy and enforces the positivity of density and pressure, with rigorous proof provided using the geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach [K. Wu and C.-W. Shu, SIAM Review, 65:1031-1073, 2023]. For the magnetic subsystem, we develop an implicit finite difference CT method that conserves energy and maintains a globally DDF constraint. This nonlinear system is efficiently solved to machine precision using an iterative algorithm. Since the CT method is unconditionally energy-stable and conserves steady density and internal energy, the PPCT scheme requires only a mild CFL condition for the finite volume method to ensure stability and the PP property. While the focus is on 2D cases for clarity, the extension to 3D is discussed. Several challenging numerical experiments, including highly magnetized MHD jets with high Mach numbers, validate the PPCT scheme's accuracy, robustness, and high resolution.</description>

      <title>Accelerated alternating minimization algorithm for low-rank approximations in the Chebyshev norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, low-rank approximations of matrices are an important component of many methods in science and engineering. Traditionally, low-rank approximations are considered in unitary invariant norms, however, recently element-wise approximations have also received significant attention in the literature. In this paper, we propose an accelerated alternating minimization algorithm for solving the problem of low-rank approximation of matrices in the Chebyshev norm. Through the numerical evaluation we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure for large-scale problems. We also theoretically investigate the alternating minimization method and introduce the notion of a $2$-way alternance of rank $r$. We show that the presence of a $2$-way alternance of rank $r$ is the necessary condition of the optimal low-rank approximation in the Chebyshev norm and that all limit points of the alternating minimization method satisfy this condition.</description>

      <title>Multicontinuum splitting scheme for multiscale flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose multicontinuum splitting schemes for multiscale problems, focusing on a parabolic equation with a high-contrast coefficient. Using the framework of multicontinuum homogenization, we introduce spatially smooth macroscopic variables and decompose the multicontinuum solution space into two components to effectively separate the dynamics at different speeds (or the effects of contrast in high-contrast cases). By treating the component containing fast dynamics (or dependent on the contrast) implicitly and the component containing slow dynamics (or independent of the contrast) explicitly, we construct partially explicit time discretization schemes, which can reduce computational cost. The derived stability conditions are contrast-independent, provided the continua are chosen appropriately. Additionally, we discuss possible methods to obtain an optimized decomposition of the solution space, which relaxes the stability conditions while enhancing computational efficiency. A Rayleigh quotient problem in tensor form is formulated, and simplifications are achieved under certain assumptions. Finally, we present numerical results for various coefficient fields and different continua to validate our proposed approach. It can be observed that the multicontinuum splitting schemes enjoy high accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mesh-Informed Reduced Order Models for Aneurysm Rupture Risk Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of the cardiovascular system needs to be accurately reproduced in order to promptly acknowledge health conditions; to this aim, advanced multifidelity and multiphysics numerical models are crucial. On one side, Full Order Models (FOMs) deliver accurate hemodynamic assessments, but their high computational demands hinder their real-time clinical application. In contrast, ROMs provide more efficient yet accurate solutions, essential for personalized healthcare and timely clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in cardiovascular medicine by integrating FOMs with ROMs for predicting the risk of aortic aneurysm growth and rupture. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), sampled at different growth stages of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, are predicted by means of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs exploit the natural graph structure of the mesh obtained by the Finite Volume (FV) discretization, taking into account the spatial local information, regardless of the dimension of the input graph. Our experimental validation framework yields promising results, confirming our method as a valid alternative that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sparse Generalized Singular Vectors for Feature Selection in Proximal Support Vector Machines with Application to Breast and Ovarian Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents approaches to compute sparse solutions of Generalized Singular Value Problem (GSVP). The GSVP is regularized by $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_q$-penalty for $0&lt;q&lt;1$, resulting in the $\ell_1$-GSVP and $\ell_q$-GSVP formulations. The solutions of these problems are determined by applying the proximal gradient descent algorithm with a fixed step size. The inherent sparsity levels within the computed solutions are exploited for feature selection, and subsequently, binary classification with non-parallel Support Vector Machines (SVM). For our feature selection task, SVM is integrated into the $\ell_1$-GSVP and $\ell_q$-GSVP frameworks to derive the $\ell_1$-GSVPSVM and $\ell_q$-GSVPSVM variants. Machine learning applications to cancer detection are considered. We remarkably report near-to-perfect balanced accuracy across breast and ovarian cancer datasets using a few selected features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Sparse Physics Informed Backpropagation (SPInProp), a new class of methods for accelerating backpropagation for a specialized neural network architecture called Low Rank Neural Representation (LRNR). The approach exploits the low rank structure within LRNR and constructs a reduced neural network approximation that is much smaller in size. We call the smaller network FastLRNR. We show that backpropagation of FastLRNR can be substituted for that of LRNR, enabling a significant reduction in complexity. We apply SPInProp to a physics informed neural networks framework and demonstrate how the solution of parametrized partial differential equations is accelerated.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to use Sinc interpolation in the context of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, neural networks with learnable activation functions, which recently gained attention as alternatives to multilayer perceptron. Many different function representations have already been tried, but we show that Sinc interpolation proposes a viable alternative, since it is known in numerical analysis to represent well both smooth functions and functions with singularities. This is important not only for function approximation but also for the solutions of partial differential equations with physics-informed neural networks. Through a series of experiments, we show that SincKANs provide better results in almost all of the examples we have considered.</description>

Abstract: We consider conditions for the convergence of sequences in terms of positive and alternating Perron expansions ($P$-representation and $P^-$-representation). These conditions are crucial to determine the continuity of functions that are defined using $P$-representation or $P^-$-representation of real numbers.</description>

      <title>Integrating Physics-Informed Deep Learning and Numerical Methods for Robust Dynamics Discovery and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating a priori physics knowledge into machine learning leads to more robust and interpretable algorithms. In this work, we combine deep learning techniques and classic numerical methods for differential equations to solve two challenging problems in dynamical systems theory: dynamics discovery and parameter estimation. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches on a suite of test problems exhibiting oscillatory and chaotic dynamics. When comparing the performance of various numerical schemes, such as the Runge-Kutta and linear multistep families of methods, we observe promising results in predicting the system dynamics and estimating physical parameters, given appropriate choices of spatial and temporal discretization schemes and numerical method orders.</description>

      <title>DeepONet for Solving PDEs: Generalization Analysis in Sobolev Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of operator learning, specifically DeepONet, to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike function learning methods that require training separate neural networks for each PDE, operator learning generalizes across different PDEs without retraining. We focus on the performance of DeepONet in Sobolev training, addressing two key questions: the approximation ability of deep branch and trunk networks, and the generalization error in Sobolev norms. Our findings highlight that deep branch networks offer significant performance benefits, while trunk networks are best kept simple. Moreover, standard sampling methods without adding derivative information in the encoding part are sufficient for minimizing generalization error in Sobolev training, based on generalization analysis. This paper fills a theoretical gap by providing error estimations for a wide range of physics-informed machine learning models and applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.07330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Intrinsic Surface Finite Element Method (ISFEM) was recently proposed to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on surfaces. ISFEM proceeds by writing the PDE with respect to a local coordinate system anchored to the surface and makes direct use of the resulting covariant basis. Starting from a shape-regular triangulation of the surface, existence of a local parametrization for each triangle is exploited to approximate relevant quantities on the local chart. Standard two-dimensional FEM techniques in combination with surface quadrature rules complete the ISFEM formulation thus achieving a method that is fully intrinsic to the surface and makes limited use of the surface embedding only for the definition of basis functions. However, theoretical properties have not yet been proved. In this work we complement the original derivation of ISFEM with its complete convergence theory and propose the analysis of the stability and error estimates by carefully tracking the role of the geometric quantities in the constants of the error inequalities. Numerical experiments are included to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new power method to obtain solutions of eigenvalue problems. The method can determine not only the dominant or lowest eigenvalues but also all eigenvalues without the need for a deflation procedure. The method uses a functional of an operator (or a matrix) to select or filter an eigenvalue. The method can freely select a solution by varying a parameter associated to an estimate of the eigenvalue. The convergence of the method is highly dependent on how closely the parameter to the eigenvalues. In this paper, numerical results of the method are shown to be in excellent agreement with the analytical ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the framework of upwind summation-by-parts (SBP) operators developed by Mattsson (2017, doi:10.1016/j.jcp.2017.01.042) and study different flux vector splittings in this context. To do so, we introduce discontinuous-Galerkin-like interface terms for multi-block upwind SBP methods applied to nonlinear conservation laws. We investigate the behavior of the upwind SBP methods for flux vector splittings of varying complexity on Cartesian as well as unstructured curvilinear multi-block meshes. Moreover, we analyze the local linear/energy stability of these methods following Gassner, Sv\"ard, and Hindenlang (2022, doi:10.1007/s10915-021-01720-8). Finally, we investigate the robustness of upwind SBP methods for challenging examples of shock-free flows of the compressible Euler equations such as a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the inviscid Taylor-Green vortex.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Hermitian Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence of Hermitian Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to the spectral properties of self-adjoint Koopman operators. Hermitian DMD is a data-driven method that approximates the Koopman operator associated with an unknown nonlinear dynamical system, using discrete-time snapshots. This approach preserves the self-adjointness of the operator in its finite-dimensional approximations. \rev{We prove that, under suitably broad conditions, the spectral measures corresponding to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions computed by Hermitian DMD converge to those of the underlying Koopman operator}. This result also applies to skew-Hermitian systems (after multiplication by $i$), applicable to generators of continuous-time measure-preserving systems. Along the way, we establish a general theorem on the convergence of spectral measures for finite sections of self-adjoint operators, including those that are unbounded, which is of independent interest to the wider spectral community. We numerically demonstrate our results by applying them to two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>When Lanczos Iterations Generate Symmetric Quadrature Nodes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Golub-Welsch algorithm [ Math. Comp., 23: 221-230 (1969)] has long been assumed symmetric for estimating quadratic forms. Recent research indicates that asymmetric quadrature nodes may be more often and the existence of a practical symmetric quadrature for estimating matrix quadratic form is even doubtful.This paper derives a sufficient condition for symmetric quadrature nodes for estimating quadratic forms involving the Jordan-Wielandt matrices which frequently arise from many applications. The condition is closely related to how to construct an initial vector for the underlying Lanczos process. Applications of such constructive results are demonstrated by estimating the Estrada index in complex network analysis.</description>

      <title>pETNNs: Partial Evolutionary Tensor Neural Networks for Solving Time-dependent Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs), a novel framework for solving time-dependent partial differential equations with high accuracy and capable of handling high-dimensional problems. Our architecture incorporates tensor neural networks and evolutional parametric approximation. A posterior error bounded is proposed to support the extrapolation capabilities. In the numerical implementations, we adopt a partial update strategy to achieve a significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining precision and robustness. Notably, as a low-rank approximation method of complex dynamical systems, the pETNNs enhance the accuracy of evolutional deep neural networks and empowers computational abilities to address high-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the pETNNs in solving time-dependent complex equations, including the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, high-dimensional heat equations, highdimensional transport equations, and dispersive equations of higher-order derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fast scheme for approximating the Mittag-Leffler function by an efficient sum-of-exponentials (SOE), and apply the scheme to the viscoelastic model of wave propagation with mixed finite element methods for the spatial discretization and the Newmark-beta scheme for the second-order temporal derivative. Compared with traditional L1 scheme for fractional derivative, our fast scheme reduces the memory complexity from $\mathcal O(N_sN) $ to $\mathcal O(N_sN_{exp})$ and the computation complexity from $\mathcal O(N_sN^2)$ to $\mathcal O(N_sN_{exp}N)$, where $N$ denotes the total number of temporal grid points, $N_{exp}$ is the number of exponentials in SOE, and $N_s$ represents the complexity of memory and computation related to the spatial discretization. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Barycentric rational approximation for learning the index of a dynamical system from limited data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of data-driven identification of dynamical systems, specifically for systems whose behavior at large frequencies is non-standard, as encoded by a non-trivial relative degree of the transfer function or, alternatively, a non-trivial index of a corresponding realization as a descriptor system. We develop novel surrogate modeling strategies that allow state-of-the-art rational approximation algorithms (e.g., AAA and vector fitting) to better handle data coming from such systems with non-trivial relative degree. Our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we describe a strategy to build rational surrogate models with prescribed relative degree, with the objective of mirroring the high-frequency behavior of the high-fidelity problem, when known. The surrogate model's desired degree is achieved through constraints on its barycentric coefficients, rather than through ad-hoc modifications of the rational form. On the other hand, we present a degree-identification routine that allows one to estimate the unknown relative degree of a system from low-frequency data. By identifying the degree of the system that generated the data, we can build a surrogate model that, in addition to matching the data well (at low frequencies), has enhanced extrapolation capabilities (at high frequencies). We showcase the effectiveness and robustness of the newly proposed method through a suite of numerical tests.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Regularity Structures B-series which are used for describing solutions of singular stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). We define composition and substitutions of these B-series and as in the context of B-series for ordinary differential equations, these operations can be rewritten via products and Hopf algebras which have been used for building up renormalised models. These models provide a suitable topology for solving singular SPDEs. This new construction sheds a new light on these products and open interesting perspectives for the study of singular SPDEs in connection with B-series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computers, operating on entirely different physical principles and abstractions from those of classical digital computers, sets forth a new computing paradigm that can potentially result in game-changing efficiencies and computational performance. Specifically, the ability to simultaneously evolve the state of an entire quantum system leads to quantum parallelism and interference. Despite these prospects, opportunities to bring quantum computing to bear on problems of computational mechanics remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum computing can indeed be used to solve representative volume element (RVE) problems in computational homogenisation with polylogarithmic complexity of $\mathcal{O}((\log N)^c)$, compared to $\mathcal{O}(N^c)$ in classical computing. Thus, our quantum RVE solver attains exponential acceleration with respect to classical solvers, bringing concurrent multiscale computing closer to practicality. The proposed quantum RVE solver combines conventional algorithms such as a fixed-point iteration for a homogeneous reference material and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, the quantum computing reformulation of these algorithms requires a fundamental paradigm shift and a complete rethinking and overhaul of the classical implementation. We employ or develop several techniques, including the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), quantum encoding of polynomials, classical piecewise Chebyshev approximation of functions and an auxiliary algorithm for implementing the fixed-point iteration and show that, indeed, an efficient implementation of RVE solvers on quantum computers is possible. We additionally provide theoretical proofs and numerical evidence confirming the anticipated $\mathcal{O} \left ((\log N)^c \right)$ complexity of the proposed solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new shape functional defined for toroidal domains that we call harmonic helicity, and study its shape optimization. Given a toroidal domain, we consider its associated harmonic field. The latter is the magnetic field obtained uniquely up to normalization when imposing zero normal trace and zero electrical current inside the domain. We then study the helicity of this field, which is a quantity of interest in magneto-hydrodynamics corresponding to the L2 product of the field with its image by the Biot--Savart operator. To do so, we begin by discussing the appropriate functional framework and an equivalent PDE characterization. We then focus on shape optimization, and we identify the shape gradient of the harmonic helicity. Finally, we study and implement an efficient numerical scheme to compute harmonic helicity and its shape gradient using finite elements exterior calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a heat radiative transport equation, we consider a particle undergoing collisions in a space-time domain and propose a method to sample its escape time, space and direction from the domain. The first step of the procedure is an estimation of how many elementary collisions is safe to take before chances of exiting the domain are too high; then these collisions are aggregated into a single movement. The method does not use any model nor any particular regime of parameters. We give theoretical results both under the normal approximation and without it and test the method on some benchmarks from the literature. The results confirm the theoretical predictions and show that the proposal is an efficient method to sample the escape distribution of the particle.</description>

The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible.
  While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii).
  The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.</description>

      <title>Surrogate model for Bayesian optimal experimental design in chromatography</title>

Abstract: We applied Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (OED) in the estimation of parameters involved in the Equilibrium Dispersive Model for chromatography with two components with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The coefficients estimated were Henry's coefficients, the total absorption capacity and the number of theoretical plates, while the design variables were the injection time and the initial concentration. The Bayesian OED algorithm is based on nested Monte Carlo estimation, which becomes computationally challenging due to the simulation time of the PDE involved in the dispersive model. This complication was relaxed by introducing a surrogate model based on Piecewise Sparse Linear Interpolation. Using the surrogate model instead the original reduces significantly the simulation time and it approximates the solution of the PDE with high degree of accuracy. The estimation of the parameters over strategical design points provided by OED reduces the uncertainty in the estimation of parameters. Additionally, the Bayesian OED methodology indicates no improvements when increasing the number of measurements in temporal nodes above a threshold value.</description>

      <title>Random large eddy simulation for 3-dimensional incompressible viscous flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for simulation of incompressible viscous flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering method in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Numerical simulations are carried out for both laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>
