      <title>Introduction to some of the simplest topological phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes explain the classification of some simple fermionic topological phases of matter in a pedestrian manner, with an aim to be maximally pedagogical = doing things in excruciating detail. We focus on a many-body perspective, even if many of the models we work with are non-interacting. We start out with symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of free fermions that are protected by U(1) symmetry = topological insulators. We then look at fermion topological phases that don't even need a symmetry = topological superconductors, and explain how their classification changes in presence of spinless time-reversal symmetry. We close by perturbatively checking which of the 1D topological phases we had found are stable to interactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlation effects in twisted bilayer graphene under strain and lattice relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of lattice effects due to heterostrain and relaxation on the correlated electron physics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, by applying dynamical mean-field theory to the topological heavy fermion model. Heterostrain is responsible for splitting the 8-fold degenerate flat bands into two 4-fold degenerate subsets, while relaxation breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the unperturbed THF model. The interplay of dynamical correlation effects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a wide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band degeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent maximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully reproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy results alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy of local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy measurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the stronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the electron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and stability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping. Our results show that even fine-level structures in the experimental data can now be faithfully reproduced and understood.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: A Gauging Nexus between Topological and Fracton Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work [arXiv:2505.13604], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper, we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Strain-tunable anomalous Hall effect in hexagonal MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control and manipulate time-reversal ($T$) symmetry-breaking phases with near-zero net magnetization is a sought-after goal in spintronic devices. The recently discovered hexagonal altermagnet manganese telluride ($\alpha$-MnTe) is a prime example. It has a compensated $A$-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state where the in-plane ferromagnetic (FM) moments in each layer are stacked antiferromagnetically along the $c$ axis, yet exhibits a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that breaks the $T$-symmetry with a vanishingly small $c$-axis FM moment. However, the presence of three 120$^\circ$ separated in-plane magnetic domains presents a challenge in understanding the origin of AHE and the effective control of the altermagnetic state. Here we use neutron scattering to show that a compressive uniaxial strain along the next-nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn bond direction detwins $\alpha$-MnTe into a single in-plane magnetic domain, aligning the in-plane moments along the same direction. Furthermore, we find that uniaxial strain (-0.2% to 0.1%) significantly sharpens the magnetic hysteresis loop and switches the sign of the AHE near room temperature. Remarkably, this is achieved without altering the AFM phase-transition temperature, which can only be explained by a strain-induced modification of the electronic band structure. Our work not only unambiguously establishes the relationship between the in-plane moment direction and the AHE in $\alpha$-MnTe but also paves the way for future applications in highly scalable, strain-tunable magnetic sensors and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Knight shift measurements probing Fermi surface changes under pressure in CeRhIn$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Knight shift measurements of the In(1) and In(2) sites in CeRhIn$_5$ as a function of pressure. In contrast to the $c$ axis, the in-plane components of the In(1) Knight shift tensor exhibit little to no pressure dependence. These results indicate that the dipolar component of the tensor is strongly suppressed at the In(1) site, while it remains constant with pressure at the In(2) site. We analyze the hyperfine coupling in terms of a tight binding model for the electronic structure, and determine that the pressure dependence of the In(1) shift cannot be explained in terms of changes to the crystal field parameters, but rather can be understood in terms of an increase in the 4f electron content at the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that the hyperfine coupling reflects changes in the electronic structure near a Kondo breakdown quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Hybridization gap and $f$-electron effect evolutions with Cd- and Sn-doping in CeCoIn$_5$ via infrared spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated hole (Cd)- and electron (Sn)-doped CeCoIn$_5$ (CeCo(In$_{1-x}T_x$)$_5$ ($T$ = Cd or Sn)) using infrared spectroscopy. Doping-dependent hybridization gap distribution functions were obtained from the optical conductivity spectra based on the periodic Anderson model formalism. The hybridization gap distribution exhibits two components: in-plane and out-of-plane hybridization gaps. The doping-dependent evolution of the two gaps indicated that the out-of-plane gap was more sensitive to doping. Furthermore, the magnetic optical resistivity exhibited a doping-dependent evolution of the $f$-electron amplitude. The two dopant types exhibited different physical properties depending on the level of doping. The Sn dopant increases the $f$-electron amplitude, whereas the Cd dopant does not affect the $f$-electron amplitude. Doping-dependent effective mass is peaked at pure (or undoped) CeCoIn$_5$. Our spectroscopic results may help understand the doping-dependent electronic evolution of one of the canonical heavy fermion systems, CeCoIn$_5$.</description>

      <title>Holographic Aspects of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT, particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition in the deep interior.</description>

      <title>A General Many-Body Perturbation Framework for Moir\'e Systems: Application to Rhombohedral Pentalayer Graphene/hBN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices host a rich variety of correlated topological states, including interaction-driven integer and fractional Chern insulators. A common approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework for moir\'e systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle corrections. We apply this framework to moir\'e superlattice consisted of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Our all-band Hartree-Fock calculations, which include all plane-wave components up to the high-energy cutoff of the continuum model, reveal a phase diagram at moir\'e filling $\nu=1$ that qualitatively aligns with experimental measurements. Incorporating RPA correlation energy further yields quantitative agreement with the evolution of transport properties across electric fields. The $GW$ quasiparticle bands exhibit significantly reduced gaps and bandwidths compared to Hartree-Fock results, while quasiparticle weights close to unity indicate that the ground state is well-described by a Slater determinant, justifying the qualitative effectiveness of mean-field approaches for integer fillings in this system. Our versatile framework provides a systematic beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Anderson chain with two-particle hybridization of localized and itinerant electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modified Anderson lattice is proposed, whose the Hamiltonian accounts for the two-particle hybridization of localized and itinerant electrons instead of one-particle hybridization which takes into account in the original Anderson model. The 1D version of this model can be solved using the Bethe ansazt. It has been shown that hybridization between itinerant and frozen localized electrons results in an effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons. The magnitude and sign of this interaction depend on the position of the level relative to the Fermi energy (the energy of this level corresponds to the two-particle state of localized electrons at a site). It is shown that when the energy of an localized electron in the two-particle state lies above the Fermi energy, the effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons is attractive. A repulsive interaction between itinerant electrons occurs when this energy lies below the Fermi energy. Thus, two-part hybridization between localized and itinerant electrons can lead to effective attraction between itinerant electrons, which is unique in itself and may underlie the nature of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a random singlet ground state in the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$. Cationic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ disorder generates a broad distribution of Cu$^{2+}$-F$^{-}$-Cu$^{2+}$ exchange couplings. Despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions, no magnetic order or freezing occurs, with $\mu$SR measurements confirming dynamics down to 58 mK. $T$-linear specific heat, a Curie-like susceptibility tail, and universal power-law scaling with data collapse in $\chi(T)$, $M(H)$, $C_{\rm mag}/T$, $^{23}$Na $(1/T_1T)$ and $\lambda_{\rm LF}$ demonstrate a disorder-driven network of singlets and orphan spins, distinct from a clean quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Inelastic scattering and transient localization from coupling to two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an electron interacting locally with two-level systems (TLSs) as an archetypal model for charge transport in the presence of inelastic scatterers. To assess the importance of quantum effects in the optical and d.c. conductivity we solve the model numerically without approximations using the finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM), and compare the results with Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). In the slow fluctuation limit, the coupling to the TLSs causes transient localization of the carriers analogous to the one recently found in the electron-boson scattering problem, featuring enhanced resistivities and displaced Drude peaks. Fast inelastic scatterers suppress localization, restoring a more conventional regime where transport and optical properties are governed by independent scattering events.</description>

      <title>Climbing the ladder: a method for identifying promising copper-lead apatites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a DFT screening procedure for copper-substituted lead apatites of the composition Pb$_9$Cu(XO$_4$)$_6$Y that enforces three design rules: thermodynamic stability, Cu site preference, and symmetry robustness of the near-Fermi electronic structure. A convex-hull analysis over P/V/As as X, O/F/Cl/Br as Y, identifies vanadates as the only members on or beneath the hull. Across the family, Cu substitution at Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($4f$) preserves flat bands at E$_F$, whereas Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($6h$) either gaps or severely distorts them. Small symmetry-lowering relaxations ($P3 \rightarrow P1$) are also capable of opening the band gap, motivating symmetry robustness as a filter. Applying these criteria singles out Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ (and, possibly, Cl$_2$) as leading candidates. This work motivates experimental study of the selected compounds, as well as a dedicated study of strong correlations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a consequence of their spin-orbit entangled ground state, many $5d^{5}$ iridate materials display a peculiar double peak structure in optical transport quantities, such as absorption and conductivity. Their common interpretation is based on the presence of Hubbard subbands in the half-filled $j_{\mathrm{eff}}=1/2$ manifold. Herein, we challenge this picture, proposing a scenario based on the presence of spin-polaron (SP) quasiparticles, and assigning a dominant SP character to the first peak. We illustrate it by taking the materials Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ as paradigmatic examples, which we investigate within the dynamical mean-field theory and the self-consistent Born approximation. Both theories reproduce nontrivial features revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and optical transport measurements, supporting our interpretation. In the case of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, we show how the SP scenario survives in the low-doped regime. Similar optical transport fingerprints are expected to be found in the wider class of $5d^5$ iridates and more generally in strongly correlated antiferromagnetic regimes, such as those found in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Enhanced Thermoelectric Effect Driven by Martensitic Transformation in the Weak Itinerant Ferromagnet Co$_2$NbSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetic and thermoelectric properties of the full Heusler alloy Co$_2$NbSn, which exhibits a martensitic transformation at 240 K. Magnetization measurements reveal weak itinerant ferromagnetism in the martensitic phase, which is well described by Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory. The characteristic spin fluctuation parameters were estimated to be T_0 = 1.0$\times$10^3 K and T_A = 7.2$\times$10^3 K. Seebeck coefficient measurements under magnetic fields up to 9 T show complex temperature and field dependence, which we decomposed into electron diffusion, spin fluctuation drag, and magnon drag components. A significant magnon-drag contribution was identified in both austenite and martensitic phases. Remarkably, this contribution is strongly enhanced in the martensitic phase compared to the austenite phase, despite a smaller magnetic moment. These findings provide evidence for robust low-energy spin excitations and highlight the potential of martensitic transformation in enhancing the thermoelectric performance of itinerant ferromagnetic alloys.</description>

      <title>Chern classes of the multilayer fractional quantum Hall bundle on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called multilayer wave functions were introduced in the study of the fractional Quantum Hall effect by Halperin and others. They are defined with the help of a symmetric matrix $K$ in $M^k(\mathbb{N})$, which encodes the couplings between the $k$ layers where particles live. We study the multilayer quantum states in the case where each layer is a Riemann surface of genus $g$. These states form a vector bundle over the Jacobian variety of the Riemann surface, or the space of Aharonov-Bohm fluxes in physics terminology. Burban-Klevtsov have determined the rank and first Chern class of this bundle when $g=1$, and Klevtsov-Zvonkine computed the Chern character of this bundle in the single layer case for any genus. We generalize the latter approach to the multilayer case and compute the Chern character of the multilayer bundle for any genus, and any possible number of non-localized quasi-holes, under the assumption that the bilinear form associated to $K-I$ is non negative. The key tools are the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula, Berezin integration and Wick's formula for exterior algebras. We show that when all quasi-holes are localized, the Chern character is compatible with the bundle being projectively flat. Furthermore, for those configurations, the conductance becomes independent of the genus and is equal to the sum of the coefficients of the inverse matrix $K^{-1}$, proving two conjectures by Keski-Vakkuri and Wen. We also find the relation linking $K$, the genus of the surface, the magnetic field and the number of non-localized quasi holes in each layer, which was studied under the name of ''shift formula''. Finally, we study conditions on the matrix $K$ under which states having only localized quasi-holes maximize the total particle number, as well as the asymptotics for large magnetic fields in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality in cuprate superconductors revealed by optical conductivity measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous temperature ($T$)-linear behaviour of the transport scattering rate in the normal state of strongly correlated electron systems is called strange metallicity \cite{zaanen:2004,phillips:2022,hartnoll:2022,chowdhury:2022,yuan:2022}. Although strange metallicity is crucial to understanding superconductivity in correlated electron systems, its origin remains elusive to date \cite{hussey:2023}. Here, we present the doping-, temperature-, and frequency ($\omega$)-dependent transport properties of overdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ in a wide doping range of 0.183 to 0.231. We observe that the optical scattering rate and effective mass exhibit an $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour at a critical doping of $p_{c} \simeq$ 0.231. Away from the critical doping, the $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour is destroyed below a doping-dependent crossover temperature $T_\Delta(p) \sim |p-p_{c}|^{0.24}$. Furthermore, the optical coherence mode (OCM) observed within the superconducting dome rapidly broadens and eventually disappears as the critical doping is approached. The emergence of the $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour of the transport scattering rate and broadening of the OCM near the critical doping strongly suggests that strange metallic behaviour is caused by quantum critical fluctuations. Our results provide compelling spectroscopic evidence for quantum criticality in cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic defect intolerance in the ultra-pure metal PtSn$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that can exceed 1000, we show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of timescales in a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.</description>

      <title>Single crystal growth, structural and physical properties, and absence of a charge density wave in Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials with charge density waves (CDWs) are fascinating quantum systems, offering an ideal platform to explore intertwined orders and to uncover novel mechanisms behind CDW formation. Chemical models have been developed and applied to predict CDW in $AM_6X_6$-type kagome materials, such as the rattling chain model based on ScV6Sn6 and the magnetic energy-saving model based on FeGe. In this study, we successfully synthesized Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6 single crystals using the vapor transport method. As predicted by the rattling chain model, these crystals are expected to exhibit kagome CDW behavior. Magnetization measurements indicate that Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6 is an easy-axis antiferromagnet with T_N = 488 K and transport measurements reveal metallic behavior primarily driven by electron-type carriers. However, no clear signatures of a CDW were observed in Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate a markedly distinct electronic structure compared to related compounds: instead of a carrier-doping-induced rigid shift, the density of states shifted away from the Fermi level. Consistent with our structural investigations, the absence of a CDW and the unusual band structure can be attributed to the bonding characteristic within Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6. The strong covalent bonds of Ti-Ge1b, along with the solid Ge1b-Ge1b dimers, prevent the Ti-Ge1b-Ge1b-Ti chain from rattling. The presence of Fe-Fe antibonding state at the Fermi level enhances the spin polarization and depletes the electronic density around the Fermi level. Our results suggest that both the ionic radius and the bonding characteristics of the filler atom are crucial for the formation of CDWs in kagome materials. These factors can serve as supplementary terms to the rattling chain model, providing new insights for the discovery of novel kagome CDW materials.</description>

      <title>Fidelity zeros and Lee-Yang theory of quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lee-Yang theory is central to the analysis of thermal phase transitions. However, the underlying mechanism of the theory and the nature of Lee-Yang zeros in quantum many-body systems remains elusive. Here, we develop a unified framework for understanding quantum phase transitions from fidelity zeros induced by symmetry breaking. These zeros, arising from transitions between symmetry sectors, obey the Lee-Yang theorem and give rise to fidelity edges near critical points. Quantum criticality is further characterized through the finite-size scaling of fidelity zeros. As concrete examples, we analytically and numerically investigate fidelity zeros in one- and two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models under a complex magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of Lee-Yang theory and open avenues for exploring unexplored landscapes of phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>What causes the variation in superconducting properties of UTe$_{2}$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaching a consensus on the superconducting order parameter of unconventional superconductors remains a central challenge in the field of magnetically-mediated superconductivity. Though UTe$_{2}$ is largely accepted as a rare example of an odd-parity superconductor, its precise order parameter remains highly debated, even at ambient conditions. A key underlying issue is the large sample-to-sample variation in superconducting properties at zero applied pressure and magnetic field. Here, we investigate the origin of the observed variation by means of single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. Our results reveal highly ordered crystalline lattices, in agreement with the expected $Immm$ structure, and no signs of uranium vacancies. Tiny amounts of interstitial defects, however, are observed on the Te2 layers that host Te chains along the b axis. We argue that these defects give rise to slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are enough to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_{2}$. Our findings highlight the need to focus future order parameter determination efforts on single crystals of UTe$_{2}$ with minimal amounts of structural disorder.</description>

      <title>Superfluid-Mott transition in a frustrated triangular optical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric frustration can significantly increase the complexity and richness of many-body physics and, for instance, suppress antiferromagnetic order in quantum magnets. Here, we employ ultracold bosonic $^{39}$K atoms in a triangular optical lattice to study geometric frustration by stabilizing the gas at the frustrated upper band edge using negative absolute temperatures. We find that geometric frustration suppresses the critical interaction strength for the (chiral-)superfluid to Mott insulator ($\chi$-SF-MI) quantum phase transition by a factor of 2.7(3) and furthermore changes the critical dynamics of the transition. Although the emergence of coherence during fast ramps from MI to the ($\chi$-)SF regime is continuous in both cases, for ramps longer than a few tunnelling times, significant differences emerge. In the \frs case, no long-range order emerges on the studied timescales, highlighting a significantly reduced rate or even saturation of the emerging coherence. This work opens the door to quantum simulations of frustrated systems that are often intractable by classical simulations.</description>

      <title>Particle-hole asymmetric phases in doped twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite much theoretical work, developing a comprehensive ab initio model for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has proven challenging due to the inherent trade-off between accurately describing the band structure and incorporating the interactions within the Hamiltonian, particularly given the topological obstruction -- so-called fragile topology -- to the description of the model in terms of localized symmetric Wannier functions within the flat band manifold. Here, we circumvent this obstruction by using an extended 8-orbital model, for which localized Wannier orbitals have been formulated by Carr et al. [1]. We constructed an extended multi-orbital Hubbard model, and performed Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations to explore its phase diagram across commensurate fillings from -3 to 3. We found several nearly-degenerate insulating states at charge neutrality, all of which exhibit orbital orders. Crucially, TBG near magic angle is known to be particle-hole asymmetric, which is naturally captured by the single-particle band structure of our model and is reflected in the distinction between the symmetry broken states obtained at electron and hole dopings away from the charge neutral point. At filling -1 and +2, quantum anomalous hall states are obtained, while for the rest of the integer fillings away from charge neutrality, we found the system to realize metallic states with various orbital, valley and spin orderings. We also observed that most of the Hartree--Fock ground states exhibit a generalized valley Hund's-like rule, resulting in valley polarization. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of the intra-valley and inter-valley exchange interactions is crucial to properly stabilize the ordered symmetry-broken states. In agreement with experiments, we find significant particle-hole asymmetry, which underscores the importance of using particle-hole asymmetric models.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Fractional Chern Insulators and Competing States in Flat Moir\'e Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breakthrough experiments have recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moir\'e materials. However, all states observed are Abelian, the possible existence of more exotic non-Abelian FCIs remains controversial both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we investigate the competition between charge density wave (CDW) order, gapless composite fermion liquid (CFL), and non-Abelian Moore-Read states at half-filling of a moir\'e band. Although groundstate (quasi-)degeneracies and spectral flow are not sufficient for distinguishing between charge order and Moore-Read states, we find evidence using entanglement spectroscopy that both these states of matter can be realized with Coulomb interactions. By further analyzing the graviton excitations of Moore-Read states, we unveil that the ground states exhibit a mixed behavior of Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian, despite the weak breaking of particle-hole symmetry. In a double twisted bilayer graphene model, transitions between these phases can be driven by the coupling strength between the layers: at weak coupling there is a CFL phase and at strong coupling a CDW order emerges. Remarkably, however, there is compelling evidence for a non-Abelian Moore-Read FCI phase at intermediate coupling.</description>

      <title>Neodymium ions as charge reservoir in NdNiO$_2$: from lack of long range order to electron-doping-induced antiferromagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study magnetism in the electron-doped infinite-layer nickelate NdNiO$_2$. We perform an unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculation for a tight-binding model which contains both nickel and neodymium orbitals. We reproduce the self-doping effect, which is the escape of charge onto the neodymium bands. By fixing all free parameters to realistic values we find that undoped NdNiO$_2$ lies right {\it outside} the antiferromagnetic (AFM) region of the phase diagram. This is consistent with experiments, which find no long-range order in the ground state of NdNiO$_2$, yet see short-range AFM correlations and broad magnetic excitations. We also find that the self-doping effect leads to a dramatic increase in the stability of the AFM solution upon electron doping -- a behavior that is strikingly different from what is, for instance, observed in the cuprates. Finally, for smaller charge transfer energies than suggested for NdNiO$_2$, the self-doping effect may be quite strong and stabilise various stripe configurations already on the mean-field level.</description>

Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.</description>

      <title>Next-generation EDIpack: A Lanczos-based package for quantum impurity models featuring general broken-symmetry phases, flexible bath topologies and multi-platform interoperability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a next-generation version of EDIpack, a flexible, high-performance numerical library using Lanczos-based exact diagonalization to solve generic quantum impurity problems, such as those introduced in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory to describe extended strongly correlated materials. This new release efficiently solves impurity problems allowing for different broken-symmetry solutions, including superconductivity, featuring local spin-orbit coupling and/or electron-phonon coupling. It provides quick access to dynamical correlation functions on the entire complex frequency plane at zero and low-temperatures. The modular architecture of the software not only provides Fortran APIs but also includes bindings to C/C++, interfaces with Python and Julia or with TRIQS and w2dynamics research platforms, thus ensuring unprecedented level of inter-operability. The outlook includes further extensions to study quantum materials and cold atoms quantum simulators, as well as quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface serves as a mold for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges, such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally, half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition, when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.</description>

      <title>Interaction dependence of the Hall response for the Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the behavior of the Hall response of a Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder in a magnetic field as a function of the repulsive on-site atomic interactions. We consider a wide range of interaction strengths, from the weakly interacting limit to the hardcore regime. This is realized by computing the Hall polarization following the quench of a weak linear potential which induces the flow of a current through the system, using time-dependent matrix product state numerical simulations. We complement our understanding in the regime of small magnetic fields by analytical calculations of the equilibrium value of the Hall polarization for non-interacting bosonic atoms, or under a mean-field assumption. The Bose-Hubbard triangular flux ladder exhibits a rich phase diagram, containing Meissner, vortex and biased-chiral superfluid phases. We show that the Hall response can be employed to fingerprint the various chiral state, the frustration effects occurring in the limit of strong interactions, and the phase boundaries of the equilibrium phase diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are eigenstates in non-integrable isolated quantum systems that defy typical thermalization paradigms, violating the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and quantum ergodicity. We identify exact analytic scar solutions in a 2+1 dimensional lattice gauge theory in a quasi-1d limit as zero-magic resource stabilizer states.</description>

      <title>Nodal superconducting gap structure and topological surface states of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ is a candidate for hosting intrinsic spin-triplet superconductivity. At present, however, the type of triplet Cooper pairing realized in UTe$_2$ remains unknown, which calls for further experimental and theoretical investigations. In this paper, we develop a microscopic minimal model for the superconducting phases of UTe$_2$ based on recent findings in the description of its low-energy normal state electronic properties. We apply the resulting theoretical model to extract the nodal gap properties of the allowed superconducting ground states, and determine their associated topological surface states on the experimentally relevant (0-11) cleave plane. We find that the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ enforces additional point nodes in excess to the point nodes imposed by symmetry, which may reconcile several experiments seemingly in conflict with B$_{2u}$ or B$_{3u}$ pairing symmetries. Furthermore, we map out the in-gap Majorana surface-bound modes existing on the (0-11) surface, and discuss their potential for additional insight into the pairing structure of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Accurate crystal field Hamiltonians of single-ion magnets at mean-field cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.</description>
