      <title>Intermediate mass T Tauri disk masses and a comparison to their Herbig disk descendants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precursors of Herbig stars are called Intermediate Mass T Tauri (IMTT) stars, which have spectral types later than F, but stellar masses between 1.5 and 5 M_\odot, and will eventually become Herbig stars with spectral types of A and B. ALMA Band 6 and 7 archival data are obtained for 34 IMTT disks with continuum observations, 32 of which have at least 12CO, 13CO, or C18O observations although most of them at quite shallow integrations. The disk integrated flux together with a stellar luminosity scaled disk temperature are used to obtain a total disk dust mass by assuming optically thin emission. Using thermochemical Dust And LInes (DALI) models from previous work, we additionally obtain gas masses of 10/35 of the IMTT disks based on the CO isotopologues. The IMTT disks in this study have the same dust mass and radius distributions as Herbig disks. The dust mass of the IMTT disks is higher compared to that of the T Tauri disks, as is also found for the Herbig disks. No differences in dust mass are found for group I versus group II disks, in contrast to Herbig disks. The disks for which a gas mass could be determined show similar high mass disks as for the Herbig disks. Comparing the disk dust and gas mass distributions to the mass distribution of exoplanets shows that there also is not enough dust mass in disks around intermediate mass stars to form the massive exoplanets. On the other hand there is more than enough gas to form the atmospheres of exoplanets. We conclude that the sampled IMTT disk population is almost indistinguishable compared to Herbig disks, as their disk masses are the same, even though these are younger objects. Based on this, we conclude that planet formation is already well on its way in these objects, and thus planet formation should start early on in the lifetime of Herbig disks.</description>

      <title>A complete Herbig disk mass survey in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disks around intermediate mass stars called Herbig disks are the formation sites of giant exoplanets. Obtaining a complete inventory of these disks will therefore give insights into giant planet formation. However, until now no complete disk survey has been done on Herbig disks in a single star-forming region. Orion is the only nearby region with a significant number of Herbig disks (N=35) to carry out such a survey. Using new NOEMA observations of 25 Herbig disks, in combination with ALMA archival data of 10 Herbig disks, results in a complete sample of all know Herbig disks in Orion. Using uv-plane analysis for the NOEMA observed disks, and literature values of the ALMA observed disks, we obtain the dust masses of all Herbig disks and obtain a cumulative dust mass distribution. Additionally, six disks with new CO isotopologues detections are presented, one of which is detected in C17O. We calculate the external ultraviolet (UV) irradiance on each disk and compare the dust mass to it. We find a median disk dust mass of 11.7 M_\oplus for the Herbig disks. Comparing the Herbig disks in Orion to previous surveys for mainly T Tauri disks in Orion, we find that while ~50% of the Herbig disks have a mass higher than 10 M_\oplus, this is at most 25% for the T~Tauri disks. This difference is especially striking when considering that the Herbig disks are around a factor of two older than the T Tauri disks. Comparing to the Herbig disks observed with ALMA from a previous study, no significant difference is found between the distributions. We find a steeper (slope of -7.6) relationship between the dust mass and external UV irradation compared to that of the T~Tauri disks (slope of -1.3). This work shows the importance of complete samples, giving rise to the need of a complete survey of the Herbig disk population.</description>

      <title>NGTS-33b: A Young Super-Jupiter Hosted by a Fast Rotating Massive Hot Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few decades planet search surveys have been focusing on solar type stars, and only recently the high-mass regimes. This is mostly due to challenges arising from the lack of instrumental precision, and more importantly, the inherent active nature of fast rotating massive stars. Here we report NGTS-33b (TOI-6442b), a super-Jupiter planet with mass, radius and orbital period of 3.6 $\pm$ 0.3 M$_{\rm jup}$, 1.64 $\pm$ 0.07 R$_{\rm jup}$ and $2.827972 \pm 0.000001$ days, respectively. The host is a fast rotating ($0.6654 \pm 0.0006$ day) and hot (T$_{\rm eff}$ = 7437 $\pm$ 72 K) A9V type star, with a mass and radius of 1.60 $\pm$ 0.11 M$_{\odot}$ and 1.47 $\pm$ 0.06 R$_{\odot}$, respectively. Planet structure and Gyrochronology models shows that NGTS-33 is also very young with age limits of 10-50 Myr. In addition, membership analysis points towards the star being part of the Vela OB2 association, which has an age of $\sim$ 20-35 Myr, thus providing further evidences about the young nature of NGTS-33. Its low bulk density of 0.19$\pm$0.03 g cm$^{-3}$ is 13$\%$ smaller than expected when compared to transiting hot Jupiters with similar masses. Such cannot be solely explained by its age, where an up to 15$\%$ inflated atmosphere is expected from planet structure models. Finally, we found that its emission spectroscopy metric is similar to JWST community targets, making the planet an interesting target for atmospheric follow-up. Therefore, NGTS-33b's discovery will not only add to the scarce population of young, massive and hot Jupiters, but will also help place further strong constraints on current formation and evolution models for such planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Water vapor as a probe of the origin of gas in debris disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris disks embrace the formation and evolution histories of planetary systems. Recent detections of gas in these disks have received considerable attention, as its origin ties up ongoing disk evolution and the present composition of planet-forming materials. Observations of the CO gas alone, however, cannot reliably differentiate between two leading, competing hypotheses: (1) the observed gas is the leftover of protoplanetary disk gas, and (2) the gas is the outcome of collisions between icy bodies. We propose that such differentiation may become possible by observing cold water vapor. Order-of-magnitude analyses and comparison with existing observations are performed. We show that different hypotheses lead to different masses of water vapor. This occurs because, for both hypotheses, the presence of cold water vapor is attributed to photodesorption from dust particles by attenuated interstellar UV radiation. Cold water vapor cannot be observed by current astronomical facilities as most of its emission lines fall in the far-IR (FIR) range. This work highlights the need for a future FIR space observatory to reveal the origin of gas in debris disks and the evolution of planet-forming disks in general.</description>

      <title>Solar Energetic Particle Track Accumulation in Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Dust Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplanetary dust grains (IDPs) originate from a variety of sources and are dynamically transported across the solar system. While in transport, high-$Z$ solar energetic particles (SEPs) with energies of $\sim$1 MeV/nuc leave damage tracks as they pass through IDPs. SEP track densities can be used as a measure of a grain's space exposure and in turn, help to constrain their lifetimes and origins. Stratospherically collected IDPs with relatively high track densities ($&gt;10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$) have been interpreted as originating from the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. To further test this hypothesis, we use a dynamical dust grain tracing model to explore the accumulation of SEP tracks within EKB dust grains. We demonstrate that, neglecting collisions, dust grains with radii up to 500 $\mu$m are capable of transiting from the EKB to 1 au despite gravitational perturbations from the outer planets, albeit with decreasing probability as a function of size. Despite this, we find that EKB grains cannot accumulate sufficient tracks to match those reported in the terrestrial stratospheric IDP collection when applying SEP track accumulation rates established from lunar samples at 1 au and assuming the SEP flux scales with heliocentric distance as $r^{-1.7}$. By exploring the radial scaling of the SEP flux, we find that a shallower SEP radial distribution of $r^{-1.0}$ does allow for the accumulation of $&gt;$$10^{10}$ tracks cm$^{-2}$ in EKB dust grains that reach 1 au. We urge further research into the propagation and distribution of high-$Z$ SEPs throughout the heliosphere in order to better constrain track accumulation in IDPs.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Stability in Planetary Systems with Similar Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs numerical simulations to explore the relationship between the dynamical instability of planetary systems and the uniformity of planetary masses within the system, quantified by the Gini index. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between system stability and mass uniformity. Specifically, planetary systems with higher mass uniformity demonstrate increased stability, particularly when they are distant from first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs). In general, for non-resonant planetary systems with a constant total mass, non-equal mass systems are less stable than equal mass systems for a given spacing in units of mutual Hill radius. This instability may arise from the equipartition of the total random energy, which can lead to higher eccentricities in smaller planets, ultimately destabilizing the system. This work suggests that the observed mass uniformity within multi-planet systems detected by \textit{Kepler} may result from a combination of survival bias and ongoing dynamical evolution processes.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous rotation of a nanosatellite FITSAT-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous rotation of an ultra-small satellite was observed and its driving torque was explained by the thermal interaction between the air molecules and the surfaces of the satellite heated by the radiation from the earth. This mechanism has the similarity with a usual radiometer, except the point that the velocity of the satellite is sufficiently faster than that of the thermal velocity of the air molecules, and that the mean free path of the air molecules is sufficiently longer than the characteristic length of the satellite. Using dimension analysis, the torque was found to be significant to a small size of satellite. This rotation mechanism can be applied to any small objects, which are revolting around a planet radiating a black body radiation and has the atmospheric gas.</description>

      <title>Did the terrestrial planets of the Solar System form by pebble accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant accretion process leading to the formation of the terrestrial planets of the Solar System is a subject of intense scientific debate. Two radically different scenarios have been proposed. The classic scenario starts from a disk of planetesimals which, by mutual collisions, produce a set of Moon to Mars-mass planetary embryos. After the removal of gas from the disk, the embryos experience mutual giant impacts which, together with the accretion of additional planetesimals, lead to the formation of the terrestrial planets on a timescale of tens of millions of years. In the alternative, pebble accretion scenario, the terrestrial planets grow by accreting sunward-drifting mm-cm sized particles from the outer disk. The planets all form within the lifetime of the disk, with the sole exception of Earth, which undergoes a single post-disk giant impact with Theia (a fifth protoplanet formed by pebble accretion itself) to form the Moon. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we revisit all available constraints: compositional (in terms of nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies and chemical composition), dynamical and chronological. We find that the pebble accretion scenario is unable to match these constraints in a self-consistent manner, unlike the classic scenario.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG LXIV: An inner eccentric sub-Neptune and an outer sub-Neptune-mass candidate around BD+00 444 (TOI-2443)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined in depth the star BD+00 444 (GJ 105.5, TOI-2443; V = 9.5 mag; d = 23.9 pc), with the aim of characterizing and confirming the planetary nature of its small companion, the planet candidate TOI-2443.01, which was discovered by TESS. We monitored BD+00 444 with the HARPS-N spectrograph for 1.5 years to search for planet-induced radial-velocity (RV) variations, and then analyzed the RV measurements jointly with TESS and ground-based photometry. We determined that the host is a quiet K5 V, and we revealed that the sub-Neptune BD+00 444 b has a radius of $R_b=2.36\pm0.05 R_{\oplus}$, a mass of $M_b=4.8\pm1.1 M_{\oplus}$ and, consequently, a rather low-density value of $\rho_b=2.00+0.49-0.45$ g cm-3, which makes it compatible with both an Earth-like rocky interior with a thin H-He atmosphere and a half-rocky, half-water composition with a small amount of H-He. Having an orbital period of about 15.67 days and an equilibrium temperature of about 519 K, BD+00 444 b has an estimated transmission spectroscopy metric of about 159, which makes it ideal for atmospheric follow-up with the JWST. Notably, it is the second most eccentric inner transiting planet, $e=0.302+0.051-0.035$, with a mass below 20 $M_{\oplus}$, among those with well-determined eccentricities. We estimated that tidal forces from the host star affect both planet b's rotation and eccentricity, and strong tidal dissipation may signal intense volcanic activity. Furthermore, our analysis suggests the presence of a sub-Neptune-mass planet candidate, BD+00 444 c, having an orbital period of $P=96.6\pm1.4$ days, and a minimum mass $M\sin{i}=9.3+1.8-2.0 M_{\oplus}$. With an equilibrium temperature of about 283 K, BD+00 444 c is right inside the habitable zone; however, this candidate necessitates further observations and stronger statistical evidence to be confirmed.

      <title>Gl 725A b: a potential super-Earth detected with SOPHIE and SPIRou in an M dwarf binary system at 3.5 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a super-Earth candidate orbiting the nearby mid M dwarf Gl\,725A using the radial velocity (RV) method. The planetary signal has been independently identified using high-precision RVs from the SOPHIE and SPIRou spectrographs, in the optical and near-infrared domains, respectively. We modelled the stellar activity signal jointly with the planet using two Gaussian Processes, one for each instrument to account for the chromaticity of the stellar activity and instrumental systematics, along with a Keplerian model. The signal is significantly detected with a RV semi-amplitude of $1.67\pm0.20$ m/s. The planet Gl 725A b is found to be in an orbit compatible with circular with a period of $11.2201\pm0.0051$ days. We analysed 27 sectors of TESS photometry on which no transit event was found. We determined a minimum mass of $M_{p}\sin{i}=2.78\pm0.35\,M_{\oplus}$ which places the planet in the super-Earth regime. Using Mass-Radius relationships we predict a planetary radius to be between 1.2 and $2.0\,R_{\oplus}$. The proximity of Gl 725A, of only 3.5 pc, makes this new exoplanet one of the closest to Earth and joins the group of S-type low-mass planets in short orbits ($P&lt;15$ d) around close M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at an oblique heliospheric termination shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Injection process of pickup ion acceleration at a heliospheric termination shock is investigated. Using two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation, accelerated pickup ions are self-consistently reproduced by tracking long time evolution of shock with unprecedentedly large system size in the shock normal direction. Reflected pickup ions drive upstream large amplitude waves through resonant instabilities. Convection of the large amplitude waves causes shock surface reformation and alters the downstream electromagnetic structure. A part of pickup ions are accelerated to tens of upstream flow energy in the time scale of $\sim 100$ times inverse ion gyro frequency. The initial acceleration occurs through shock surfing acceleration mechanism followed by shock drift acceleration mechanism. Large electrostatic potential accompanied by the upstream waves enables the shock surfing acceleration to occur.</description>

Abstract: We carried out a project involving the systematic analysis of microlensing data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network survey. The aim of this project is to identify lensing events with complex anomaly features that are difficult to explain using standard binary-lens or binary-source models. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of microlensing events KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 display highly complex patterns with three or more anomaly features. These features cannot be adequately explained by a binary-lens (2L1S) model alone. However, the 2L1S model can effectively describe certain segments of the light curve. By incorporating an additional source into the modeling, we identified a comprehensive model that accounts for all the observed anomaly features. Bayesian analysis, based on constraints provided by lensing observables, indicates that the lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are binary systems composed of M dwarfs. For KMT-2022-BLG-2480, the primary lens is an early K-type main-sequence star with an M dwarf companion. The lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are likely located in the bulge, whereas the lens of KMT-2022-BLG-2480 is more likely situated in the disk. In all events, the binary stars of the sources have similar magnitudes due to a detection bias favoring binary source events with a relatively bright secondary source star, which increases detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the non-dissipative orbital evolution of a binary system comprising non-compact components with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Paper we determine the non-dissipative tidal evolution of a close binary system with an arbitrary eccentricity in which the spin angular momenta of both components is misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. We focus on the situation where the orbital angular momentum dominates the spin angular momenta and so remains at small inclination to the conserved total angular momentum. Torques arising from rotational distortion and tidal distortion taking account of Coriolis forces are included. This extends the previous work of Ivanov &amp; Papaloizou relaxing the limitation resulting from the assumption that one of the components is compact and has zero spin angular momentum. Unlike the above study, the evolution of spin-orbit inclination angles is driven by both types of torque. We develop a simple analytic theory describing the evolution of orbital angles and compare it with direct numerical simulations. We find that the tidal torque prevails near 'critical curves' in parameter space where the time-averaged apsidal precession rate is close to zero. In the limit of small spin, these curves exist only for systems that have at least one component with retrograde rotation. As in our previous work, we find solutions close to these curves for which the apsidal angle librates. As noted there, this could result in oscillation between prograde and retrograde states. We consider the application of our approach to systems with parameters similar to those of the misaligned binary DI Her.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Cosmic Rays and Associated MeV Gamma-Ray Emissions in the Protoplanetary System</title>

Abstract: Low-energy cosmic rays (LECRs) play a crucial role in the formation of planetary systems, and detecting and reconstructing the properties of early LECRs is essential for understanding the mechanisms of planetary system formation. Given that LECRs interact with the surrounding medium to produce nuclear de-excitation line emissions, which are gamma-ray emissions with energy mainly within 0.1--10 MeV and are unaffected by stellar wind modulation, these emissions can accurately reflect the properties of LECRs. This study introduces an innovative method for using gamma-ray emissions to infer LECR properties. We employed the Parker transport equation to simulate the propagation and spectral evolution of LECRs in a protoplanetary disk and calculated the characteristic gamma-ray emissions resulting from interactions between LECRs and disk material. These gamma-ray emissions encapsulate the spectral information of LECRs, providing a powerful tool to reconstruct the cosmic ray environment at that time. This method, supported by further theoretical developments and observations, will fundamentally enhance our understanding of the impact of CRs on the origin and evolution of planetary systems and address significant scientific questions regarding the cosmic ray environment at the origin of life.</description>

      <title>The lowest-radiation environments in the Solar System: new opportunities for underground rare-event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino, muon, and gamma-ray fluxes in extraterrestrial environments in our Solar System via semi-analytical estimates and Monte Carlo simulations. In sites with negligible atmosphere, we find a strong reduction in the cosmic-ray-induced neutrino and muon fluxes relative to their intensities on Earth. Neutrinos with energies between 50 MeV and 100 TeV show particularly strong suppression, by as much as 10$^3$, even at shallow depths. The solar neutrino suppression increases as the square of the site's distance from the Sun. Natural radiation due to nuclear decay is also expected to be lower in many of these locations and may be reduced to effectively negligible levels in the liquid water environments. The sites satisfying these characteristics represent an opportunity for greatly extending the physics reach of underground searches in fundamental physics, such as searches for WIMP Dark Matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay, the diffuse supernova neutrinos, and neutrinos from nearby supernova. As a potential near-term target, we propose a measurement of muon and gamma-ray fluxes in an accessible underground lunar site such as the Mare Tranquillitatis Pit to perform a first measurement of the prompt component in cosmic-ray-induced particle production, and to constrain lunar evolution models.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Object Accessibility and Mission Design</title>

Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) represent a compelling and under-explored category of celestial bodies, providing physical laboratories to understand the formation of our solar system and probe the composition and properties of material formed in exoplanetary systems. In this work, we investigate existing approaches to designing successful flyby missions to ISOs, including a deep learning-driven guidance and control algorithm for ISOs traveling at velocities over 60 km/s. We have generated spacecraft trajectories to a series of synthetic representative ISOs, simulating a ground campaign to observe the target and resolve its state, thereby determining the cruise and close approach delta-Vs required for the encounter. We discuss the accessibility of and mission design to ISOs with varying characteristics, with special focuses on 1) state covariance estimation throughout the cruise, 2) handoffs from traditional navigation approaches to novel autonomous navigation for fast flyby regimes, and 3) overall recommendations about preparing for the future in situ exploration of these targets. The lessons learned also apply to the fast flyby of other small bodies, e.g., long-period comets and potentially hazardous asteroids, which also require tactical responses with similar characteristics.</description>
