      <title>Multiplicative near-vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-vector spaces extend linear algebra tools to non-linear algebraic structures, enabling the study of non-linear problems. However, explicit constructions remain rare. This paper introduces a broad computable family of near-vector spaces, called multiplicative, and explores their properties. This family is fully determined over finite, real, and complex fields. We also discuss the existence of infinite coproducts, and products in the category of near-vector spaces. Finally, we introduce the complexification of a multiplicative near-vector space over the real numbers.</description>

      <title>Homological Integrals for Weak Hopf Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a homological integral for an infinite-dimensional weak Hopf algebra and use the homological integral to prove several structure theorems. For example, we prove that the Artin--Schelter property and the Van den Bergh condition are equivalent for a noetherian weak Hopf algebra, and that the antipode is automatically invertible in this case. We also prove a decomposition theorem that states that any weak Hopf algebra finite over an affine center is a direct sum of Artin--Schelter Gorenstein, Cohen--Macaulay, GK dimension homogeneous weak Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Koszul resolution for linear monoidal functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce regular sequences and associated Koszul resolutions for monoids in the category of functors over an essentially small linear symmetric monoidal category. Next we define polynomials over such monoids. We compute the Hochschild cohomology functors and prove a relative analogue of Hilbert's syzygy theorem for polynomials over tensor idempotent commutative monoids.</description>

      <title>Adjointable maps between linear orthosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an (anisotropic) Hermitian space $H$, the collection $P(H)$ of at most one-dimensional subspaces of $H$, equipped with the orthogonal relation $\perp$ and the zero linear subspace $\{0\}$, is a linear orthoset and up to orthoisomorphism any linear orthoset of rank $\geq 4$ arises in this way. We investigate in this paper the correspondence of structure-preserving maps between Hermitian spaces on the one hand and between the associated linear orthosets on the other hand. Our particular focus is on adjointable maps.
  We show that, under a mild assumption, adjointable maps between linear orthosets are induced by quasilinear maps between Hermitian spaces and if the latter are linear, they are adjointable as well. Specialised versions of this correlation lead to Wigner-type theorems; we see, for instance, that orthoisomorphisms between the orthosets associated with at least $3$-dimensional Hermitian spaces are induced by quasiunitary maps.
  In addition, we point out that orthomodular spaces of dimension $\geq 4$ can be characterised as irreducible Fr\'echet orthosets such that the inclusion map of any subspace is adjointable. Together with a transitivity condition, we may in this way describe the infinite-dimensional classical Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Results on left-right approximation for algebraic morphisms and for analytic morphisms of weakly finite singularity type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Artin approximation (AP) reads: any formal solution of a system of (analytic, resp. algebraic) equations of implicit function type is approximated by ``ordinary" solutions (i.e. analytic, resp. algebraic). Morphisms of scheme-germs, e.g. Maps((k^n,o),(k^m,o)) are usually studied up to the left-right equivalence. The natural question is the left-right version of Artin approximation: when is the formal left-right equivalence of morphisms approximated by the ``ordinary" (i.e. analytic, resp. algebraic) equivalence? In this case the standard Artin approximation is not directly applicable, as the involved (functional) equations are not of implicit function type. Moreover, the na\"ive extension does not hold in the analytic case, because of Osgood-Gabrielov-Shiota examples. The left-right version of Artin approximation (LRAP) was established by M. Shiota for morphisms that are either Nash or [real-analytic and of finite singularity type]. We establish LRAP and its stronger version of P\l oski (LRAPP) for Maps(X,Y) where X,Y are analytic/algebraic germs of schemes of any characteristic. More precisely: * LRAP, LRAPP, the inverse Artin approximation (and its P\l oski's version) hold for algebraic morphisms and for finite analytic morphisms. * LRAP holds for analytic morphisms of weakly-finite singularity type. (For char&gt;0 we impose certain integrability condition.)
  This latter class of morphisms of ``weakly-finite singularity type" (which we introduce) is of separate importance. It extends naturally the traditional class of morphisms of ``finite singularity type", while preserving their non-pathological behavior. The definition goes via the higher critical loci and higher discriminants of morphisms with singular targets.
  We establish basic properties of these critical loci. In particular: any map is finitely (right) determined by its higher critical loci.</description>
