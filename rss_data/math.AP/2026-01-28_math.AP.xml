      <title>Dynamic Response of a Finite Circular Plate on an Elastic Half-Space Using the Truncated Lamb Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an exact operator formulation for the dynamic interaction between a finite circular elastic plate and an elastic half-space. Classical analyses, beginning with Lamb's representation of the half-space response, typically assume an infinite plate and rely on diagonalization of the soil operator via the continuous Hankel transform. For a plate of finite radius $R$, however, both traction and displacement are supported only on $0 \le r \le R$, leading to the spatially truncated Lamb operator \[ \mathscr{M}(\omega) = \chi_{[0,R]} \, T(\omega)\, \chi_{[0,R]}, \] where $T(\omega)$ is the Hankel multiplier involving the Rayleigh denominator $\Omega(\xi,\omega)$. Truncation destroys the diagonal structure of $T(\omega)$ and introduces real-axis singularities associated with the Rayleigh pole, in addition to square-root branch points at $\xi = k_T$ and $\xi = k_L$. We represent the action of $\mathscr{M}(\omega)$ on a finite-disk Bessel basis $\{ \phi_n(r) = A_{1,n} J_0(\lambda_n r) + A_{2,n} I_0(\lambda_n r)\},$ which satisfies the free-edge boundary conditions of the plate, and derive explicit expressions for the resulting matrix elements. These involve integrals of the Lamb kernel evaluated as Cauchy principal values, with residue contributions corresponding to radiation damping in the half-space. The resulting operator matrix is dense but spectrally convergent. Its inversion yields a complete frequency-domain solution for finite-radius plates. The analysis reproduces Chen et al.'s finite-radius experiments for small $R$, approaches the infinite-radius limit as $R \to \infty$, and quantifies finite-radius corrections. To our knowledge, this is the first exact operator-level treatment of finite-radius plate-half-space interaction that retains the full nonlocal Lamb kernel.</description>

      <title>Quantitative light-particle limit for the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck-Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic limit of the Vlasov--Fokker--Planck--Navier--Stokes system in the light particle regime, where the particle relaxation takes place on a singularly fast time scale. Using a relative entropy method adapted to this scaling, we develop the first quantitative convergence theory for the light particle limit. Our analysis yields explicit rates for the convergence of both the kinetic distribution and the fluid velocity, extending the qualitative compactness-based result of Goudon, Jabin, and Vasseur [Indiana Univ. Math. J., 53, (2004), 1495--1515]. Moreover, we show that these quantitative estimates propagate in weak topologies and, in particular, lead to optimal convergence rates in the bounded Lipschitz distance. The results apply on both the torus and the whole space, providing a unified quantitative description of the light particle hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>The {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon inequality related to grain boundary motion and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality for the mathematical model of grain boundary motion. We first derive a curve shortening equation with time-dependent mobility, which guarantees the energy dissipation law for the grain boundary energy, including the difference between orientations of the constituent grains as a state variable. Next, we discuss the {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality for the grain boundary energy. Finally, we give applications of the inequality to the energy.</description>

      <title>A Fokker-Planck equation with superlinear drift at infinity for Integrate-and-Fire model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Integrate-and-Fire model is a Fokker-Planck equation arising in neuroscience. It describes the evolution of the probability density of the neuronal membrane potential and fitting has shown that the inclusion of a em superlinear drift provides the most realistic description. To make sense of this, we propose to set the equation on the full line, the neural activity being described by the flux at infinity. This framework serves as a model extension of the classical Noisy Integrate-and-Fire model, with a fixed firing potential. We first establish the well-posedness of the solution, establish the boundary condition at infinity which is the major difficulty. Then, state rigorously the entropy dissipation property. Finally, using Doeblin's method, we prove the exponential convergence of the solution toward the unique stationary state in full generality.</description>

      <title>Remarks on well-posedness for linear elliptic equations via divergence-free transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of linear elliptic equations, focusing on the divergence-free transformation introduced in the author's recent work [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 548 (2025), 129425]. By comparing this approach with classical bilinear form methods, we demonstrate that while standard techniques encounter limitations in handling zero-order coefficients $c \in L^1(U)$, the divergence-free transformation successfully establishes well-posedness in this setting. Furthermore, utilizing the Riesz-Thorin interpolation theorem between the cases $c \in L^1(U)$ and $c \in L^{\frac{2d}{d+2}}(U)$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions under the assumption $c \in L^s(U)$ for $s \in [1, \frac{2d}{d+2}]$.</description>

      <title>On blow up NLS with a multiplicative noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is of significant interest to understand whether a noise will speed up or prevent blow up. Under certain nondegenerate conditions, \cite{dD2005Blowup} proved a multiplicative noise will speed up blow up of NLS, in the sense that, blow up can happen in any short time with positive probability. We prove that such probability is indeed quite small, and provide a large deviation type upper bound.</description>

      <title>Existence of Weak Solutions to a Constrained Aggregation-Diffusion-Reaction Model for Multiple Sclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an existence result for weak solutions to an aggregation-diffusion-reaction equation with a constraint, arising in the modelling of multiple sclerosis. The model is derived from a general chemotaxis-type framework and describes the time evolution of the density of activated macrophages, which is subject to attraction by oligodendrocytes. The latter are governed by a constraint equation. The proof relies on a variational splitting scheme that isolates the transport (aggregation-diffusion) and reaction contributions. The structure of the constraint makes it possible to recover the oligodendrocyte density as the limit of a sequence of characteristic functions.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Solutions to a Compressible Non-Newtonian Korteweg System with Density-Dependent Viscous Stress Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to prove that if capillarity effect is taken into account then there exist dissipative solutions to a system describing viscoplastic compressible flows with density dependent viscosities in a periodic domain $\T^d$ with $d=2,3$. We calculate the relative entropy inequality and in consequence show existence of dissipative solutions and the weak-strong uniqueness for this system. Our result extends the recent result concerning the link between Euler--Korteweg and Navier--Stokes--Korteweg systems for Newtonian flows (when the viscosity depends on the density) [See D.~Bresch, M. Gisclon, I. Lacroix-Violet, {\it Arch. Rational Mech. Anal.} (2019)] to non-Newtonian flows.</description>

      <title>Integral equation methods for scattering by general compact obstacles: wavenumber-explicit estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in understanding the dependence on the wavenumber, $k$, of boundary integral operators (BIOs), supported on some set $\Gamma\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, that arise in the solution of BVPs for the Helmholtz equation, $\Delta u + k^2 u=0$. Recently, for the Dirichlet BVP with data $g$, Caetano et al (2025) have proposed an integral equation (IE) $A_k\phi=g$ that applies for arbitrary compact $\Gamma$. This formulation is a generalisation of standard first kind IEs, where the BIO is $S_k$, the single-layer BIO on a surface $\Gamma$, that apply when $\Gamma$ is the boundary of a Lipschitz domain or a screen.
  In this paper we study the dependence of $A_k$ on $k$, showing that, for $k\geq k_0&gt;0$, $\|A_k\|\leq ck$ while $\|A_k^{-1}\| \leq c'k$ if $\Gamma$ is star-shaped, where $c, c'&gt;0$ depend only on $k_0$ and $\Gamma$. Amongst other bounds we also show that: (i) on the one hand, given any mildly increasing unbounded positive sequence $(k_m)$ and any unbounded sequence $(a_m)$, there exists $\Gamma$, with connected complement, such that $\|A_{k_m}^{-1}\|\geq a_m$ for every $m$; (ii) on the other hand, for every $\Gamma\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $k_0,\varepsilon, \delta&gt;0$, there exists $c&gt;0$ and $E\subset [k_0,\infty)$, with Lebesgue measure $m(E)\leq \varepsilon$, such that $\|A_{k}^{-1}\|\leq c k^{2n+2+\delta}$ on $[k_0,\infty)\setminus E$, i.e., the growth of $\|A_{k}^{-1}\|$ is at worst polynomial in $k$ if one avoids a set $E$ of arbitrarily small measure.
  As a corollary of these results we obtain the first $k$-explicit bounds on $\|S_k^{-1}\|$ and the condition number of $S_k$ for the case that $\Gamma$ is the boundary of a Lipschitz domain, or a screen not contained in a hyperplane, and analogous estimates for the case that $\Gamma$ is a $d$-set (and so of Hausdorff dimension $d$), for non-integer values of $d$.</description>

      <title>Mode stability of self-similar wave maps without symmetry in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider wave maps from $(1+d)$-dimensional Minkowski space into the $d$-sphere. For every $d \geq 3$, there exists an explicit self-similar solution that exhibits finite time blowup. This solution is corotational and its mode stability in the class of corotational functions is known. Recently, Weissenbacher, Koch, and the first author proved mode stability without symmetry assumptions in $d =3$. In this paper we extend this result to all $d \geq 4$. On a technical level, this is the first successful implementation of the quasi-solution method where two additional parameters are present.</description>

Abstract: We study the $\Gamma$-convergence of sequences of free discontinuity functionals with linear growth defined in the space ${\rm BD}$ of functions with bounded deformation. We prove a compactness result with respect to $\Gamma$-convergence and outline the main properties of the $\Gamma$-limits, which lead to an integral representation result. The corresponding integrands are obtained by taking limits of suitable minimisation problems on small cubes. These results are then used to study the deterministic and stochastic homogenisation problem for a large class of free discontinuity functionals defined in ${\rm BD}$.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behavior of the Repulsive Pressureless Euler-Poisson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is a study of the asymptotic behavior of distributional solutions to the one-dimensional repulsive pressureless Euler-Poisson system. The system is a model for the dynamics of a mass distribution evolving on \mathbb{R} whose masses exert outward forces on one another. A discrete (describing the evolution of finitely many particles) solution is called sticky if, upon collision, particles stick together and move as one for all subsequent time, according to the conservation of mass and momentum principles. We prove results on the total energy (Hamiltonian) of the system and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of so-called "perfect" states, where the Hamiltonian is constant over all time and the solution converges to equilibrium, a single stationary particle. We provide a necessary and a sufficient condition for finite-time collapse, and present a quadratic envelope within which a solution must remain in order to collapse. We demonstrate various (counter)examples that illustrate the unique behavior of the repulsive scheme with the sticky condition, analytically and with a computer simulation.</description>

      <title>Universality in the Low Mach number limit via a convex integration framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low Mach number limit of the compressible Euler equations through the lens of convex integration. For any prescribed $L^2$ weak solution of the incompressible Euler equations, we construct a corresponding family of weak solutions to the compressible Euler equations via a refined convex integration scheme. We then prove that, as the Mach number tends to zero, this family of solutions converges strongly to the given incompressible solution. This result demonstrates that the incompressible system acts as a universal attractor in this setting: every incompressible flow can be realized as the limit of convex integration solutions to the compressible system. Our approach highlights a new form of universality for singular limits and provides a rigorous framework for understanding the incompressible limit from the perspective of weak solution theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we systematically review a series of effective methods for studying the qualitative properties of solutions to fractional equations. Beginning with the pioneering extension method and the method of moving planes in integral forms, we introduce a variety of direct methods, including the direct method of moving planes, the method of moving spheres, blow-up and rescaling techniques, the sliding method, regularity lifting, and approaches for interior and boundary regularity estimates.
  To elucidate the core ideas behind these methods, we employ simple examples that demonstrate how they can be applied to investigate qualitative properties of solutions. We also provide a comparative discussion of their respective strengths and limitations. It is our hope that this paper will serve as a useful handbook for researchers engaged in the study of fractional equations.</description>

      <title>A general theory of nonlocal elasticity based on nonlocal gradients and connections with Eringen's model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of nonlocal linear elasticity based on nonlocal gradients with general radial kernels. Starting from a nonlocal hyperelastic energy functional, we perform a formal linearization around the identity deformation to obtain a system of nonlocal linear elasticity equations. We establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, proving a general Korn-type inequality for nonlocal gradients. We show that this framework encompasses Eringen's nonlocal elasticity model as a particular case, establishing an explicit connection between the two formulations. Finally, we prove localization results demonstrating that solutions to the nonlocal problems converge to their classical local counterparts in two different regimes: as the interaction horizon vanishes and, in the fractional case, as the fractional parameter approaches one. These results provide a comprehensive and unified mathematical foundation for nonlocal elasticity theories.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates of stable and finite Morse index solutions to elliptic equations that arise in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis studies qualitative properties of solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations of Poisson type with Dirichlet boundary conditions that arise from some physical phenomena, with a particular focus on regularity, stability, and multiplicity of solutions. Building on the modern framework of solution stability and Morse index theory, the work investigates how these notions influence regularity in nonlinear elliptic problems. A central contribution is the construction of a counterexample showing that bounded radial Morse index does not prevent singular behavior of solutions in dimensions three through nine, challenging a natural extension of the Brezis-V\'azquez regularity conjecture. In addition, optimal regularity results are established for radial solutions of a non-autonomous Hardy-H\'enon equation, identifying the precise range of dimensions for which regularity holds. The thesis also addresses existence and multiplicity results for elliptic equations involving nonlinearities with spatially vanishing coefficients. Under suitable assumptions, the existence of multiple distinct solutions is proved using variational and topological methods. Finally, the thesis outlines several directions for future research, including extensions of stability-based regularity techniques to non-autonomous problems and potential applications of these techniques to field theories arising in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>On $\alpha$-entropy solutions of a nonlocal thin film equation: existence and finite speed of propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an initial-boundary value problem for a class of nonlocal thin film equations governed by the spectral fractional Laplacian with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. We were the first to establish an $\alpha$-entropy estimate for nonlocal thin film equations, which yields essential a priori bounds for the regularity and long-time behavior of weak solutions. By developing a localized version of this estimate, we prove finite speed of propagation, showing that the support of nonnegative solutions remains compact for positive times. Furthermore, we find a sufficient condition for a waiting time phenomenon, whereby the solution remains identically zero in a region for a nontrivial time interval. These results highlight new features in the interaction between nonlocal effects and classical thin film dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-parameter hyperbolic relaxation approximation to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, incorporating a first-order relaxation and the artificial compressibility method. With vanishingly small perturbations of initial velocity, we rigorously prove the simultaneous convergence of fluid velocity and pressure toward the Navier-Stokes limit in the three-dimensional case by constructing an intermediate affine system to obtain the necessary error estimates for the pressure. Furthermore, we extend the velocity convergence analysis to the case of $\mathcal O(1)$ initial velocity perturbations, and establish the global-in-time recovery of the velocity field using a modulated energy structure and delicate bootstrap arguments in both two- and three-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Boundary Value Problems Governed by Symmetric Nonlocal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal boundary value problems with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary are well-studied for nonlocal operators of the type $\mathcal{L}_\gamma u = \operatorname{PV} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \big(u(\cdot)-u(y)\big) \gamma(\cdot,y) \, \mathrm{d}y$ where the underlying kernel function $\gamma: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow [0,\infty)$ is assumed to be measurable and symmetric. In this paper, a theory is introduced for problems whose governing operator is of the more general type \[\mathcal{L}u:= \operatorname{PV} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\big(u(\cdot)-u(y)\big) \, K(\cdot, \mathrm{d}y)\] where ${K: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d) \rightarrow [0,\infty]}$ is a symmetric transition kernel. Our main focus is on nonlocal Dirichlet and Neumann problems and a classical Hilbert space approach is developed for solving designated weak formulations. As an example, the discrete Poisson problem on $\Omega=(0,1)^d$ is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider \[ \begin{cases} F(D^2 u,Du,u,x) = u^{-p}v^{-q},~\text{in}~\Omega\\ F(D^2 v,Dv,v,x)=u^{-r}v^{-s},~~\text{in}~~\Omega\\ u,v&gt;0~~\text{in}~~\Omega\\ u=v=0~\quad~\text{on}~~\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \] where $\Omega$ is an open connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ and $p,s$ are two non-negative and $q,r$ are positive real numbers. This article discuses the conditions in terms of the relations among $p,q,r$ and $s$ which lead to existence, uniqueness and non-existence of positive solutions to the system. Furthermore, we also have studied some regularity properties of solution of the system. These results are inspired by the study of Lane-Emden system of equations as in \cite{busca2002liouville,ghergu2010lane}.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Ricci flow on CP1-bundles over a product of K\"ahler-Einstein manifolds whose initial metric is constructed by the ansatz used in works by M. Wang et. al. We prove that the ansatz is preserved along the Ricci flow. Furthermore, in the K\"ahler case, we proved that Type I finite-time singularity must occur under such an ansatz.</description>

Abstract: We consider the non-homogeneous abstract linear Schr\"odinger and wave equations with zero initial conditions, defined by operators of strip-type and parabola-type in Banach spaces, respectively, and establish the well-posedness of classical solutions in appropriate vector-valued Sobolev-Slobodetskii spaces. We obtain analogous results for two extensions of these equations by replacing the previously mentioned boundedness properties of the associated operators with $R$-boundedness. As an application, we consider an abstract semilinear wave equation and establish the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to this problem for short times.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Persistence in Infinite Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by infinite-dimensional ecological and biological models such as reaction-diffusion SPDEs and stochastic functional differential equations, we develop a general criteria for stochastic persistence (coexistence) in terms of an average lyapunov function, which was previously known only in finite dimensions. To apply our results to SPDEs we analyze the projective process, and we employ a combination of mild (stochastic convolution) and variational (lyapunov function) techniques. Our analysis also requires some nontrivial well-posedness and nonnegativity results for reaction-diffusion SPDEs, which we state and prove in great generality, extending the known results in the literature. Finally, we present several examples including ecological models (Lotka-Volterra), an epidemic model (SIR), and a model for turbulence. Notably we show that, as in the SDE case, coexistence in the Lotka-Volterra model is determined by the invasion rates.</description>

      <title>On a Class of Multi-Dimensional Non-linear Time-Fractional Fokker-Planck Equations Capturing Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-fractional Fokker-Planck equation is a key model for characterizing anomalous diffusion, stochastic transport, and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics with applications in finance, chaotic dynamics, optical physics, and biological systems. In this work, we develop a semi-analytical solution for the multi-dimensional time-fractional Fokker-Planck equation employing the Laplace residual power series method. This method blends the Laplace transform and the traditional residual power series method, guaranteeing efficient solutions incorporating the memory and nonlocal effects. To validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the approach, we address several examples, including non-linear problems in multi-dimensions, and analyze the evolution of errors. The numerical simulations are compared with existing methods to confirm the adopted method's strength. The smooth and stable error evolution promises that the suggested method is a powerful tool for analyzing time-fractional Fokker-Planck equations.</description>

      <title>Variable Elliptic Structures on the Plane: Transport Dynamics, Rigidity, and Function Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study variable elliptic structures in the plane defined by a smoothly varying quadratic relation i^2 + beta(x,y) i + alpha(x,y) = 0, and the associated first order operator dbar = 1/2 (dx + i dy). Differentiating the structure relation yields explicit expressions for the derivatives of i(x,y) in terms of the coefficient functions alpha and beta, leading to a universal transport system governing their admissible variations. In the elliptic regime this system reduces to a forced complex Burgers equation for a scalar spectral parameter encoding the structure coefficients. We identify a rigidity condition under which the transport becomes conservative, and show that in this regime the generalized Cauchy Riemann operator satisfies a Leibniz rule and admits a factorization of the associated second order operator into first order components. As a consequence, classical tools of planar complex analysis, including Cauchy Pompeiu type formulas, integral representations, and elliptic second order operators, reappear in a variable coefficient setting with explicit structure. The theory is developed at the level of direct computation, emphasizing transparency of the integrability mechanism and the interplay between transport dynamics, rigidity, and function theory.</description>

      <title>Approximate controllability of a bilinear wave equation and minimum time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the global approximate controllability (GAC) of a Klein-Gordon wave equation, posed on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ of arbitrary dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}^*$, with bilinear control potentials supported on the first $(2d+1)$-Fourier modes. Let $Z(W_0)\subset \mathbb{T}^d$ be the set of essential zeroes of the initial state $W_0\in H^1\times L^2(\mathbb{T}^d)$, and $r(W_0)\geq 0$ be the maximum radius of a ball of $\mathbb{T}^d$ contained in $Z(W_0)$. Due to finite speed of propagation, the minimum control time starting from $W_0$ is necessarily larger than or equal to $r(W_0)$. We prove the following three facts.
  In low dimensions $d \in \{1,2\}$: the minimum time for GAC from $W_0 \neq 0$ is equal to $r(W_0)$.
  In any dimensions $d\geq 3$: the minimum time for GAC from $W_0$ is zero if $Z(W_0)$ has zero Lebesgue measure; and the GAC in sufficiently large time from all $W_0\neq 0$.
  The proof strategy consists in combining Lie bracket techniques \emph{\`a la Agrachev-Sarychev} with the propagation of well-prepared positive states.</description>

      <title>Mass generation for the two dimensional O(N) Linear Sigma Model in the large N limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the $O(N)$ Linear Sigma Model on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ under a scaling dictated by the formal $1/N$ expansion. We show that in the large $N$ limit, correlations decay exponentially fast, where the acquired mass decays exponentially in the inverse temperature. In fact, each marginal converges to a massive Gaussian Free Field (GFF) on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, quantified in the $2$-Wasserstein distance with a weighted $H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ cost function. In contrast to prior work on the torus via parabolic stochastic quantization, our results hold without restrictions on the coupling constants, allowing us to also obtain a massive GFF in a suitable double scaling limit. Our proof combines the Feyel/\"Ust\"unel extension of Talagrand's inequality with some classical tools in Euclidean Quantum Field Theory.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds for non-trace class noise and applications to SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of stochastic PDEs with colored, non-trace class space-time noise, one frequently encounters Gaussian series of the form $$ \sum_{n\geq 1} \gamma_n \mu_n f_n, $$ where $(\gamma_n)_{n}$ is a sequence of standard independent Gaussian variables, $g$ is an $L^\eta(\mathcal{O})$ function, $(\mu_n)_{n}$ is a sequence of scalars, and $(f_n)_n$ is an orthonormal system in $L^2(\mathcal{O})$ where $\mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is an open set. In this manuscript, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the above sum to converge in Bessel potential spaces $H^{-s,q}(\mathcal{O})$. The latter can be interpreted as a Sobolev embedding for Gaussian series. Our main theorem is formulated using weighted sequence spaces that encode the $L^\infty$-growth of the orthonormal system $(f_n)_{n}$, a feature that is crucial for obtaining sharp estimates. We apply our results to the stochastic heat equation with additive non-trace class noise. In this case, our conditions capture the scaling relationship between the heat operator and the coloring of the noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit formula for the exponent $\beta$ in the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle (FUP) established by Cohen 2023, quantifying its dependence on the porosity parameter $\nu$ of the Fourier support. This quantitative version of FUP yields an explicit essential spectral gap for convex co-compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds arising from quasi-Fuchsian groups, thereby refining the result of Tao 2025. Our result extends the earlier work of Jin-Zhang 2020 to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Green's Function-Based Enclosure Framework for Poisson's Equation and Generalized Sub- and Super-Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enclosing solutions of Poisson's equation based on generalized sub- and super-solutions constructed using fundamental solutions. The conventional definition of sub- and super-solutions based on variational inequalities often fails for natural function classes such as piecewise linear functions and encounters theoretical difficulties in non-convex polygonal domains, where H^2 regularity is lost because of corner singularities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of ``Green-representable solutions'' utilizing test functions constructed from fundamental solutions. This framework enables a new formulation of sub- and super-solutions that permits rigorous pointwise evaluation. For one-dimensional problems, we derive explicit constructions of the test functions. For two-dimensional polygonal domains, we employ the Method of Fundamental Solutions to generate test functions. The approach is validated through numerical experiments in both settings, including non-convex polygons. The results demonstrate that the proposed method yields strict and accurate pointwise enclosures of the true solution, even for problems with discontinuous source terms or geometric singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theories for a large fermionic system with the pseudo-relativistic kinetic energy and an attractive Yukawa interaction potential. We prove that the system is stable if and only if the total mass does not excess a critical value, and investigate the existence and properties of ground states in both sub-critical and critical mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Fabry-P\'erot Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise non-Hermitian Fabry-P\'erot resonances in high-contrast resonator systems and study the properties of their associated resonant modes from continuous differential models. We consider two non-Hermitian effects: the exceptional point degeneracy and the skin effect induced by imaginary gauge potentials. Using the propagation matrix formalism, we characterise these two non-Hermitian effects beyond the subwavelength regime. This analysis allows us to (i) establish the existence of exceptional points purely from radiation conditions and to (ii) prove that the non-Hermitian skin effect applies uniformly across resonant modes, yielding broadband edge localisation.</description>

      <title>Hodge decomposition for generalized Vekua spaces in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the spaces $A^p_{\alpha, \beta}(\Omega)$ of $L^p$-solutions to the Vekua equation (generalized monogenic functions) $D w=\alpha\overline{w}+\beta w$ in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $D=\sum_{i=1}^n e_i \partial_i$ is the Moisil-Teodorescu operator, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are bounded functions on $\Omega$.
  The main result of this work consists of a Hodge decomposition of the $L^2$ solutions of the Vekua equation, from this orthogonal decomposition arises an operator associated with the Vekua operator, which in turn factorizes certain Schr\"odinger operators. Moreover, we provide an explicit expression of the ortho-projection over $A^p_{\alpha, \beta}(\Omega)$ in terms of the well-known ortho-projection of $L^2$ monogenic functions and an isomorphism operator. Finally, we prove the existence of component-wise reproductive Vekua kernels and the interrelationship with the Vekua projection in Bergman's sense.</description>

      <title>Wiener-type Criterion for the Removability of the Fundamental Singularity for the Heat Equation and its Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the removability of the fundamental singularity, and equivalently for the unique solvability of the singular Dirichlet problem for the heat equation. In the measure-theoretical context, the criterion determines whether the $h$-parabolic measure of the singularity point is null or positive. From the probabilistic point of view, the criterion presents an asymptotic law for conditional Brownian motion. In {\it U.G. Abdulla, J Math Phys, 65, 121503 (2024)} the Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-type test was established. Here, we prove a new Wiener-type criterion for the "geometric" characterization of the removability of the fundamental singularity for arbitrary open sets in terms of the fine-topological thinness of the complementary set near the singularity point. In the special case when the boundary of the open set is locally represented by a graph, the minimal thinness criterion for the removability of the singularity is expressed in terms of the minimal regularity of the boundary manifold at the singularity point.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of radial potentials for given Dirichlet spectra with distinct angular momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an inverse spectral problem for radial Schr\"odinger operators with singular potentials. First, we show that the knowledge of the Dirichlet spectra for infinitely many angular momenta~$\ell$ satisfying a M\"untz-type condition uniquely determines the potential. Next, in a neighborhood of the zero potential, we prove local uniqueness from two Dirichlet spectra associated with distinct angular momenta in the cases \((\ell_1,\ell_2) = (0,1)\) and \((0,3)\). Our approach relies on an explicit analysis of the associated singular differential equation, combined with the classical Kneser--Sommerfeld formula. These results sharpen a theorem of Carlson-Shubin~(1994) and confirm, in the linearized setting and for these configurations, a conjecture originally formulated by Rundell and Sacks~(2001).</description>

      <title>Ground state solutions to generalized nonlinear wave equations with infinite-dimensional kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to existence results for time-periodic solutions of generalized nonlinear wave equations in a closed Riemannian manifold M. Our main focus lies on the doubly degenerate setting where the associated generalized wave operator has an infinite dimensional kernel and the nonlinearity may vanish on open subsets of M. To deal with this setting, we apply a direct variational approach based on a new variant of the nonlinear saddle point reduction to the associated Nehari-Pankov set. This allows us to find ground state solutions and to characterize the associated ground state energy by a fairly simple minimax principle.</description>

      <title>Blow-up, decay, and convergence to equilibrium for focusing damped cubic Klein-Gordon and Duffing equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study long-time dynamics of the damped focusing cubic Klein-Gordon equation on a compact three-dimensional Riemannian manifold, together with its space-independent reduction, the damped focusing Duffing equation. Under the geometric control condition on the damping and an assumption on the set of stationary solutions, we establish a sharp trichotomy for initial data with energy slightly above that of the ground state: every solution either blows up in finite time, decays exponentially to zero, or converges to a ground state. We provide a complete classification of the Duffing dynamics above the energy of the constant solution, use it to construct Klein-Gordon solutions realising each of the three behaviours in the case of a domain without boundary, and derive a simple spectral criterion ensuring that the ground states are nonconstant - and hence that different types of behaviour can indeed occur for solutions with initial energy above that of the ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of semilinear wave equations in non-cylindrical time-dependent domains, subject to exterior homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. Under mild regularity and monotonicity assumptions on the evolving spatial domains, we establish existence of weak solutions by two different methods: a constructive time-discretization scheme and a penalty approach. The analysis applies to nonlocal fractional Laplacians and potentials with Lipschitz continuous gradient, and to vector-valued maps.</description>

      <title>Sharp embeddings between weighted Paley-Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06442v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of estimating the operator norm of the embeddings between multidimensional weighted Paley-Wiener spaces. These can be equivalently thought as Fourier uncertainty principles for bandlimited functions. By means of radial symmetrization mechanisms, we show that such problems can all be shifted to dimension one. We provide precise asymptotics in the general case and, in some particular situations, we are able to identify the sharp constants and characterize the extremizers. The sharp constant study is actually a consequence of a more general result we prove in the setup of de Branges spaces of entire functions, addressing the operator given by multiplication by $z^k$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Applications to sharp higher order Poincar\'{e} inequalities and other related extremal problems are discussed.</description>

This generalises the $C^2$-gluing of Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, carried-out near light cones in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Relative periodic solutions in spatial Kepler problem with symmetric perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial Kepler problem with a perturbation satisfying the rotational symmetry w.r.t. the $z$-axis and the reflection symmetry w.r.t. the $(x, y)$-plane, can be reduced to an Hamiltonian system with 2 degrees of freedom after fixing the angular momentum. For small enough perturbations, we show that for certain choices of energy and angular momentum, the corresponding energy surface is compact and diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^3$, and on each compact energy surface there is a unique $z$-symmetric brake orbit, which forms a Hopf link with a planar relative periodic orbit. Moreover under some additional technical assumptions, by applying recent results from symplectic dynamics (\cite{CHHL23}) and Franks' Theorem, we prove there are infinitely many relative periodic orbits on each compact energy surface. These results can be applied to the motion of a satellite around a uniformly mass-distributed ellipsoid and the $n$-pyramidal problem, where one point mass moves along the $z$-axis and $n$ other equal point masses form a regular $n$-gon perpendicular to the $z$-axis.</description>

This leads to new results regarding the symbol calculus of such operators and their Schatten-class properties.</description>
