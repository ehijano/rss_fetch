      <title>Blow-up solutions to a class of nonlinear coupled Schr\"odinger systems with power-type-growth nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider a system of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations whose nonlinearities satisfy a power-type-growth. First, we prove that the Cauchy problem is local and global well-posedness in $L^2$ and $H^1$. Next, we establish the existence of ground state solutions. Then we use these solutions to study the dichotomy of global existence versus blow-up in finite time. Similar results were presented in the reference Noguera N. and Pastor A. 2022 https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219199720500236 for the special case when the growth of the nonlinearities was quadratic. Here we will extend them to systems with nolinearities of order $p$ (cubic, quartic and so on). Finally, we recover some known results for two particular systems, one with quadratic and the other with cubic growth nolinearities.</description>

      <title>Sobolev inequality and its applications to nonlinear PDE on noncommutative Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Sobolev inequality on noncommutative Euclidean spaces. As a simple consequence, we obtain the Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality and as its application we show global well-posedness of nonlinear PDEs in the noncommutative Euclidean space. Moreover, we show that the logarithmic Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the Nash inequality for possibly different constants in this noncommutative setting by completing the list in noncommutative Varopoulos's theorem in [37]. Finally, we present a direct application of the Nash inequality to compute the time decay for solutions of the heat equation in the noncommutative setting.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of fractional integrals and fractional derivatives on Laguerre Lipschitz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the boundedness of a class of fractional integrals and derivatives associated with
  Laguerre polynomial expansions on Laguerre Lipschitz spaces.
  The consideration of such operators is motivated by the study of corresponding results on Gaussian Lipschitz spaces.
  The key idea used here is to develop the Poisson integral theory in the Laguerre setting.</description>

      <title>Peridynamics and Anisotropic Fractional Sobolev Spaces with Variable Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our primary objective is to develop the peridynamic fractional Sobolev space and establish novel BBM-type results associated with it. We also address the peridynamic fractional anisotropic $p-$Laplacian. A secondary objective is to explore anisotropic fractional Sobolev spaces with variable exponents, where we also derive new BBM-type results. Additionally, we address the eigenvalue problem in the isotropic case.</description>

      <title>Improvement of conditions for finite time blow-up in a fourth-order nonlocal parabolic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of blow-up phenomenon for a fouth-order nonlocal parabolic equation with Neumann boundary condition,
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{ll}\ds u_{t}+u_{xxxx}=|u|^{p-1}u-\frac{1}{a}\int_{0}^a|u|^{p-1}u\ dx, &amp;
  u_x(0)=u_x(a)=u_{xxx}(0)=u_{xxx}(a)=0, &amp;
  u(x,0)=u_0(x)\in H^2(0, a),\ \ \int_0^au_0(x)\ dx=0, &amp;\end{array}\right.
  \end{equation*}
  where $a$ is a positive constant and $p&gt;1$. The existing results on the problem suggest that the weak solution will blow up in finite time if $I(u_0)&lt;0$ and the initial energy satisfies some appropriate assumptions, here $I(u_0)$ is the initial Nehari functional. In this paper, we extend the previous blow-up conditions with proving that those assumptions on the energy functional are superfluous and only $I(u_0)&lt;0$ is sufficient to ensure the weak solution blowing up in finite time. Our conclusion depicts the significant influence of mass conservation on the dynamic behavior of solution.</description>

      <title>Attaining the optimal constant for higher-order Sobolev inequalities on manifolds via asymptotic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$, and $k\geq 1$ an integer such that $n&gt;2k$. We show that there exists $B_0&gt;0$ such that for all $u \in H^{k}(M)$, \[\|u\|_{L^{2^\sharp}(M)}^2 \leq K_0^2 \int_M |\Delta_g^{k/2} u|^2 \,dv_g + B_0 \|u\|_{H^{k-1}(M)}^2,\] where $2^\sharp = \frac{2n}{n-2k}$ and $\Delta_g = -\operatorname{div}_g(\nabla\cdot)$. Here $K_0$ is the optimal constant for the Euclidean Sobolev inequality $\big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |u|^{2^\sharp}\big)^{2/2^\sharp} \leq K_0^2 \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |\nabla^k u|^2$ for all $u \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$.
  This result is proved as a consequence of the pointwise blow-up analysis for a sequence of positive solutions $(u_\alpha)_\alpha$ to polyharmonic critical non-linear equations of the form $(\Delta_g + \alpha)^k u = u^{2^\sharp-1}$ in $M$. We obtain a pointwise description of $u_\alpha$, with explicit dependence in $\alpha$ as $\alpha\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>A modified Ricci flow on arbitrary weighted graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a modified Ricci flow, as well as a quasi-normalized Ricci flow, on arbitrary weighted graph. Each of these two flows has a unique global solution. In particular, these global existence and uniqueness results do not require an exit condition proposed by Bai et al in a recent work [2]. As applications, these two Ricci flows are applied to community detection for complex networks, including Karate Club, American football games, Facebook, as well as artificial networks. In our algorithms, unlike in [5,15], there is no need to perform surgery at every iteration, only one surgery needs to be performed after the last iteration. From three commonly used criteria for evaluating community detection algorithms, ARI, NMI and Q, we conclude that our algorithms outperform existing algorithms, including Ollivier's Ricci flow [5], normalized Ollivier's Ricci flow and normalized Lin-Lu-Yau's Ricci flow [15]. The codes for our algorithms are available at https://github.com/mjc191812/Modified-Ricci-Flow.</description>

      <title>Gradient regularity for a class of elliptic obstacle problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove some regularity results for a priori bounded local minimizers of non-autonomous integral functionals of the form $$\mathcal{F}(v,\Omega)=\int_\Omega F(x,Dv)dx,$$ under the constraint $v \ge \psi$ a.e. in $\Omega$, where $\psi$ is a fixed obstacle function. Assuming that the coefficients of the partial map $x \mapsto D_\xi F(x,\xi)$ satisfy a suitable Sobolev regularity, we are able to obtain higher differentiability and Lipschitz continuity results for the local minimizers.</description>

      <title>Regularity Propagation of Global Weak Solutions to a Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard System for Incompressible Two-phase Flows with Chemotaxis and Active Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a diffuse interface model that describes the dynamics of incompressible viscous two-phase flows, incorporating mechanisms such as chemotaxis, active transport, and long-range interactions of Oono's type. The evolution system couples the Navier-Stokes equations for the volume-averaged fluid velocity $\bm{v}$, a convective Cahn-Hilliard equation for the phase-field variable $\varphi$, and an advection-diffusion equation for the density of a chemical substance $\sigma$. For the initial-boundary value problem with a physically relevant singular potential in three dimensions, we demonstrate that every global weak solution $(\bm{v}, \varphi, \sigma)$ exhibits a propagation of regularity over time. Specifically, after an arbitrary positive time, the phase-field $\varphi$ transitions into a strong solution, whereas the chemical density $\sigma$ only partially regularizes. Subsequently, the velocity field $\bm{v}$ becomes regular after a sufficiently large time, followed by a further regularization of the chemical density $\sigma$, which in turn enhances the spatial regularity of $\varphi$. Furthermore, we show that every global weak solution stabilizes towards a single equilibrium as $t\to +\infty$. Our analysis uncovers the influence of chemotaxis, active transport, and long-range interactions on the propagation of regularity at different stages of time. The proof relies on several key points, including a novel regularity result for a convective Cahn-Hilliard-diffusion system with minimal regularity requirements on the velocity field $\bm{v}$, the strict separation property of $\varphi$ for large times, as well as two conditional uniqueness results pertaining to the full system and its subsystem for $(\varphi, \sigma)$ with a given velocity, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the well-possedness of time-dependent three-dimensional Euler fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mathematical properties of time-dependent flows of incompressible fluids that respond as an Euler fluid until the modulus of the symmetric part of the velocity gradient exceeds a certain, a-priori given but arbitrarily large, critical value. Once the velocity gradient exceeds this threshold, a dissipation mechanism is activated. Assuming that the fluid, after such an activation, dissipates the energy in a specific manner, we prove that the corresponding initial-boundary-value problem is globally-in-time well-posed in the sense of Hadamard. In particular, we show that for an arbitrary, sufficiently regular, initial velocity there is a unique weak solution to the spatially periodic problem.</description>

      <title>Non-isothermal diffuse interface model for phase transition and interface evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal diffuse interface model for phase transition and interface evolution involving heat transfer. This model is constructed by integrating concepts from classical irreversible thermodynamics with the energetic variational approach. By making specific assumptions about the kinematics of the temperature, we derive a non-isothermal Allen-Cahn equation. Through both asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that in the sharp interface limit, the non-isothermal Allen-Cahn equation converges to a two-phase Stefan-like problem, under a certain scaling of the melting/freezing energy. In this regime, the motion of the liquid-solid interface and the temperature interface coincide and are governed by the mean curvature, at least for a short time. The result provides a justification for the classical Stefan problem within a certain physical regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a rigorous proof of the nonexistence of breather solutions for NLS equations is presented. By using suitable virial functionals, we are able to characterize the nonexistence of breather solutions, different from standing waves, by only using their inner energy and the power of the corresponding nonlinearity of the equation. We extend this result for several NLS models with different power nonlinearities and even the derivative and logarithmic NLS equations.</description>

      <title>Wave Interaction For A System In Elastodynamics With Initial Data Lying On The Level Set Of One Of The Riemann Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the study of interaction of waves originating from the Riemann problem centred at two different points for a system of equations modelling propagation of elastic waves. The system consists of two equations for $(u,\sigma)$, where, u is the velocity and $\sigma$ is the stress and is strictly hyperbolic and nonconservative. Study of interaction of waves is one of the most important steps in the construction of global solution with initial data in the space of functions of bounded variation using approximation procedure like the Glimm's scheme. This amounts to constructing a solution with initial data consisting of three states $(u_L, \sigma_L), (u_m, \sigma_m),$ and $(u_R, \sigma_R)$. Usually this analysis is done for the states which are in a small neighbourhood of a fixed state. Here we get explicit formula for the solution of the system when the data lies in the level sets of Riemann invariants. The speciality of the work is that we donot assume smallness conditions on the initial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of normalized solutions to the following Choquard equation with $F$ being a Berestycki-Lions type function \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u+\lambda u=(I_{\alpha}\ast F(u))f(u),\quad \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N, \\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2dx=\rho^2, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $N\geq 3$, $\rho&gt;0$ is assigned, $\alpha\in (0,N)$, $I_{\alpha}$ is the Riesz potential, and $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$ is an unknown parameter that appears as a Lagrange multiplier. Here, the general nonlinearity $F$ contains the $L^2$-subcritical and $L^2$-supercritical mixed case, the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev lower critical and upper critical cases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a system of equations which appear in the modelling of many physical phenomena. Initially this system appeared in description of the large scale structure formation. Recently it is derived as a second order queueing model. We construct weakly asymptotic solutions of the initial boundary value problem for the system and interaction of waves in the quarter plane $\{(x,t): x&gt;0,t&gt;0\}$ with boundary Riemann solution centered at $(0,0)$ and Riemann solution centered at a point $(x_0,0), x_0&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Variational characterization of a singular mixed local and nonlocal semilinear elliptic equation and its application to decomposition, symmetry and jumping problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish variational characterization of solutions of a mixed local and nonlocal singular semilinear elliptic problem. As an application of this fact, we deduce decomposition property. Further, using moving plane method, we prove symmetry of solutions of a mixed local and nonlocal singular perturbed problem, where the decomposition plays a crucial role. Finally, we apply the variational property to deduce existence, nonexistence and regularity results of a mixed local and nonlocal singular jumping problem.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability of nonsingular solitons of the Principal Chiral Field equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Principal Chiral Field model posed in 1+1 dimensions into the Lie group $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$. In this work we show the nonlinear stability of small enough nonsingular solitons. The method of proof involves the use of vector field methods as in a previous work by the second and third authors dealing with the Einstein's field equations under the Belinski-Zakharov formalism, extending for all times the size of suitable null weighted norms of the perturbations at time zero.</description>

Abstract: We prove new boundary regularity results for minimizers to the one-phase Alt-Caffarelli functional (also known as Bernoulli free boundary problem) in the case of continuous and H\"older-continuous boundary data. As an application, we use them to extend recent generic uniqueness and regularity results to families of continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Sharp local well-posedness for the Schr\"odinger-Korteweg-de Vries system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp local existence result for the Schr\"odinger-Korteweg-de Vries system with initial data in $H^k(\mathbb{R})\times H^s(\mathbb{R})$. The proof is based on the concept of \textit{integrated-by-parts strong solution}, which generalizes the classical notion of strong solution, and on frequency-restricted estimates. Moreover, we extend the known global well-posedness result to regularities $k,s&gt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>Carleson perturbations of locally Lipschitz elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1-sided Chord Arc Domains $\Omega$, we show that the $A_\infty$-absolute continuity of the elliptic measure is stable under $L^2$ Carleson perturbations provided that the elliptic operator $L_0=-{\rm div} A_0\nabla$ which is being perturbed satisfies \[\sup_{X\in \Omega }{\rm dist}(X,\partial \Omega)|\nabla A_0(X)| &lt;\infty.\] $L^2$ Carleson perturbations are are more natural and slightly more general than the Carleson perturbations previously found in the literature (those would be "$L^\infty$ Carleson perturbations"). We decided to limit the article to 1-sided CAD to make it more accessible, but the proof can easily extended to more general setting as long as we have a rich elliptic theory and the domain is 1-sided NTA.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of a chemotaxis-consumption-growth model with nonzero Dirichlet conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the asymptotics of certain parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis-consumption systems with logistic growth and constant concentration of chemoattractant on the boundary. First we prove that in two dimensional bounded domains there exists a unique global classical solution which is uniformly bounded in time, and then we show that if the concentration of chemoattractant on the boundary is sufficiently low then the solution converges to the positive steady state as time goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Solving Schiffer's problem in inverse scattering theory almost surely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we present a probabilistic perspective on the Schiffer's problem in the inverse scattering theory, which asks whether one can uniquely determine the shape of an unknown obstacle by a single far-field measurement. It is a longstanding problem and has received considerable studies in the literature. We show that this conjecture holds true in more general settings in the probability sense. Our new perspective has important implications from the practical viewpoint and also points an interesting direction of research for broader inverse problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the spectral and resolvent estimates for semiclassical pseudodifferential operators with symbol of Gevrey-$s$ regularity, near the boundary of the range of the principal symbol. We prove that the boundary spectrum free region is of size ${\mathcal O}(h^{1-\frac{1}{s}})$ where the resolvent is at most fractional exponentially large in $h$, as the semiclassical parameter $h\to 0^+$. This is a natural Gevrey analogue of a result by N. Dencker, J. Sj{\"o}strand, and M. Zworski in the $C^{\infty}$ and analytic cases.</description>

      <title>Silent Orbits and Cancellations in the Wave Trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that the wave trace of a bounded and strictly convex planar domain may be arbitrarily smooth in a neighborhood of some point in the length spectrum. In other words, the Poisson relation, which asserts that the singular support of the wave trace is contained in the closure of $\pm$ the length spectrum, can almost be made into a strict inclusion. To do so, we construct large families of domains for which there exist multiple periodic billiard orbits having the same length but different Maslov indices. Using the microlocal Balian-Bloch-Zelditch parametrix for wave invariants developed in our previous paper, we solve a large system of equations for the boundary curvature jets, which leads to the required cancellations. We call such periodic orbits silent, since they are undetectable from the ostensibly audible wave trace. Such cancellations show that there are potential limitations in using the wave trace for inverse spectral problems and more fundamentally, that the Laplace spectrum and length spectrum are inherently different mathematical objects, at least insofar as the wave trace is concerned.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansion of the Eigenvalues of a Bathtub Potential with Quadratic Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalues of a one-dimensional semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator, where the potential consist of two quadratic ends (that is, looks like a harmonic oscillator at each infinite end), possibly with a flat region in the middle. Such a potential notably has a discontinuity in the second derivative. We derive an asymptotic expansion, valid either in the high energy regime or the semiclassical regime, with a leading order term given by the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition, and an asymptotic expansion consisting of negative powers of the leading order term, with coefficients that are oscillatory in the leading order term. We apply this expansion to study the results of the Gutzwiller Trace formula and the heat kernel asymptotic for this class of potentials, giving an idea into what results to expect for such trace formulas for non-smooth potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a concise point of view on the first and the second Korn's inequality for general exponent $p$ and for a class of domains that includes Lipschitz domains. Our argument is conceptually very simple and, for $p = 2$, uses only the classical Riesz representation theorem in Hilbert spaces. Moreover, the argument for the general exponent $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ remains the same, the only change being invoking now the $q$-Riesz representation theorem (with $q$ the harmonic conjugate of $p$). We also complement the analysis with elementary derivations of Poincar\'e-Korn inequalities in bounded and unbounded domains, which are essential tools in showing the coercivity of variational problems of elasticity but also propedeutic to the proof of the first Korn inequality.</description>

      <title>On the regularity problem for parabolic operators and the role of half-time derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present the following result on regularity of solutions of the second order parabolic equation $\partial_t u - \mbox{div} (A \nabla u)+B\cdot \nabla u=0$ on cylindrical domains of the form $\Omega=\mathcal O\times\mathbb R$ where $\mathcal O\subset\mathbb R^n$ is a $1$-sided chord arc domain (it satisfies both corkscrew and Harnack chain conditions) and has uniformly $n-1$ rectifiable boundary. Let $u$ be a solution of such PDE in $\Omega$ and the non-tangential maximal function of its gradient in spatial directions $\tilde{N}(\nabla u)$ belongs to $L^p(\partial\Omega)$ for some $p&gt;1$. Furthermore, assume that for $u|_{\partial\Omega}=f$ we have that $D^{1/2}_tf\in L^p(\partial\Omega)$. Then both $\tilde{N}(D^{1/2}_t u)$ and $\tilde{N}(D^{1/2}_tH_t u)$ also belong to $L^p(\partial\Omega)$, where $D^{1/2}_t$ and $H_t$ are the half-derivative and the Hilbert transform in the time variable, respectively. We expect this result will spur new developments in the study of solvability of the $L^p$ parabolic Regularity problem as thanks to it it is now possible to formulate the parabolic Regularity problem on a large class of time-varying domains.</description>

Abstract: Given $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$ and a compact Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{N}$, we construct for every map $u$ in the critical Sobolev space $W^{m/(m + 1), m + 1} (\mathbb{S}^m, \mathcal{N})$, a map $U : \mathbb{B}^{m + 1} \to \mathcal{N}$ whose trace is $u$ and which satisfies an exponential weak-type Sobolev estimate. The result and its proof carry on to the extension to a half-space of maps on its boundary hyperplane and to the extension to the hyperbolic space of maps on its boundary sphere at infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an incompressible fluid with axial symmetry without swirl, assuming initial data such that the initial vorticity is very concentrated inside $N$ small disjoint rings of thickness $\varepsilon$, each one of vorticity mass and main radius of order $|\log\varepsilon|$. When $\varepsilon \to 0$, we show that, at least for small but positive times, the motion of the rings converges to a dynamical system firstly introduced in [NoDEA Nonlinear Diff. Eq. Appl. 6 (1999), 473-499]. In the special case of two vortex rings with large enough main radius, the result is improved reaching longer times, in such a way to cover the case of several overtakings between the rings, thus providing a mathematical rigorous derivation of the leapfrogging phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Backward-forward characterization of attainable set for conservation laws with spatially discontinuous flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a scalar conservation law with a spatially discontinuous flux at a single point x=0, and assume that the flux is uniformly convex when x\neq 0. Given an interface connection (A,B), we define a backward solution operator consistent with the concept of AB-entropy solution [4,13,16]. We then analyze the family A^{[AB]}(T) of profiles that can be attained at time T&gt;0 by AB-entropy solutions with L^\infty-initial data. We provide a characterization of A^{[AB]}(T) as fixed points of the backward-forward solution operator. As an intermediate step we establish a full characterization of A^{[AB]}(T) in terms of unilateral constraints and Ole\v{\i}nik-type estimates, valid for all connections. Building on such a characterization we derive uniform BV bounds on the flux of AB-entropy solutions, which in turn yield the L^1_{loc}-Lipschitz continuity in time of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Variational method for fractional Hamiltonian system in bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we consider the following fractional Hamiltonian system \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \begin{aligned} (-\Delta)^{s} u&amp;=H_v(u,v) \;\;&amp;&amp;\text{in}~\Omega,\\ (-\Delta)^{s} v&amp;=H_u(u,v) &amp;&amp;\text{in}~\Omega,\\ u &amp;= v = 0 &amp;&amp;\text{in} ~ \mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega, \end{aligned} \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $s\in (0,1)$, $N&gt;2s$, $H \in C^1(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R})$ and $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a smooth bounded domain. %As the problem remains unchanged if $H(u, v)$ is replaced by $H(u, v)-H(0, 0)$, hence we always assume $H(0,0)=0$.
  To apply the variational method for this problem, the key question is to find a suitable functional setting. Instead of usual fractional Sobolev spaces, we use the solutions space of $(-\Delta)^{s}u=f\in L^r(\Omega)$ for $r\ge 1$, for which we show the (compact) embedding properties. When $H$ has subcritical and superlinear growth, we construct two frameworks, respectively with interpolation space method and dual method, to show the existence of nontrivial solution. As byproduct, we revisit the fractional Lane-Emden system, i.e. $H(u, v)=\frac{1}{p+1}|u|^{p+1}+\frac{1}{q+1}|v|^{q+1}$, and consider the existence, uniqueness of (radial) positive solutions under subcritical assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of ``pure tone'' nonlinear sound waves of all frequencies. These are smooth, time periodic, oscillatory solutions of the $3\times3$ compressible Euler equations satisfying periodic or acoustic boundary conditions in one space dimension. This resolves a centuries old problem in the theory of Acoustics, by establishing that the pure modes of the linearized equations are the small amplitude limits of solutions of the nonlinear equations. Riemann's celebrated 1860 proof that compressions always form shocks is known to hold for isentropic and barotropic flows, but our proof shows that for generic entropy profiles, shock-free periodic solutions containing nontrivial compressions and rarefactions exist for every wavenumber $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the H\"older regularity condition for harmonic functions on metric measure spaces and prove that under mild volume regular condition and upper heat kernel estimate, the H\"older regularity condition, the weak Bakry-\'Emery non-negative curvature condition, the heat kernel H\"older continuity with or without exponential terms and the heat kernel near-diagonal lower bound are equivalent. As applications, firstly, we prove the validity of the so-called generalized reverse H\"older inequality on the Sierpi\'nski carpet cable system, which was left open by Devyver, Russ, Yang (Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN (2023), no. 18, 15537-15583). Secondly, we prove that two-sided heat kernel estimates alone imply gradient estimate for the heat kernel on strongly recurrent fractal-like cable systems, which improves the main results of the aforementioned paper. Thirdly, we obtain H\"older (Lipschitz) estimate for heat kernel on general metric measure spaces, which extends the classical Li-Yau gradient estimate for heat kernel on Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>A diffuse-interface Landau-de Gennes model for free-boundary nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a diffuse-interface Landau-de Gennes free energy for free-boundary nematic liquid crystals (NLC) in three dimensions submerged in isotropic liquid, where a phase field is introduced to model the deformable interface. The energy we propose consists of the original Landau-de Gennes free energy, three penalty terms and a volume constraint. We prove the existence and regularity of minimizers to the diffuse-interface energy functional. We also prove a uniform maximum principle of the minimizer under appropriate assumptions, together with a uniqueness result for small domains. Then, we establish a sharp-interface limit where minimizers of the diffuse-interface energy converge to a minimizer of a sharp-interface energy under the framework of $\Gamma$-convergence. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments with the diffuse-interface model, the findings of which are compared with existing works.</description>

      <title>Initial Data Identification for Conservation Laws with Spatially Discontinuous Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scalar conservation law with a spatially discontinuous flux at a single point $x=0$, and we study the initial data identification problem for $AB$-entropy solutions associated to an interface connection $(A,B)$. This problem consists in identifying the set of initial data driven by the corresponding $AB$-entropy solution to a given target profile~$\omega^T$, at a time horizon $T&gt;0$. We provide a full characterization of such a set in terms of suitable integral inequalities, and we establish structural and geometrical properties of this set. A distinctive feature of the initial set is that it is in general not convex, differently from the case of conservation laws with convex flux independent on the space variable. The results rely on the properties of the $AB$-backward-forward evolution operator introduced in~\cite{talamini_ancona_attset}, and on a proper concept of $AB$-genuine/interface characteristic for $AB$-entropy solutions provided in this paper.</description>

      <title>Existence, Stability and Optimal Drug Dosage for a Reaction-Diffusion System Arising in a Cancer Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a reaction-diffusion system modeling injection of a chemotherapeutic drug on the surface of a living tissue during a treatment for cancer patients is studied. The system describes the interaction of the chemotherapeutic drug and the normal, tumor and immune cells. We first establish well-posedness for the nonlinear reaction-diffusion system, then investigate the long-time behavior of solutions. Particularly, it is shown that the cancer cells will be eliminated assuming that its reproduction rate is sufficiently small in a short time period in each treatment interval. The analysis is then essentially exploited to study an optimal drug injection rate problem during a chemotherapeutic drug treatment for tumor cells, which is formulated as an optimal boundary control problem with constraints. For this, we show that the existence of an optimal drug injection rate through the boundary, and derive the first-order optimality condition.</description>

      <title>Global Strong Solutions to the Cauchy Problem of Three-dimensional Isentropic Magnetohydrodynamics Equations with Large Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem to the three-dimensional isentropic compressible Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system with density-dependent viscosities. When the initial density is linearly equivalent to a large constant state, we prove that strong solutions exist globally in time, and there is no restriction on the size of the initial velocity and initial magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Some sharp inequalities of Mizohata--Takeuchi-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ be a strictly convex, compact patch of a $C^2$ hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature and surface measure $d\sigma$ induced by the Lebesgue measure in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The Mizohata--Takeuchi conjecture states that
  \begin{equation*}
  \int |\widehat{gd\sigma}|^2w \leq C \|Xw\|_\infty \int |g|^2
  \end{equation*}
  for all $g\in L^2(\Sigma)$ and all weights $w:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow [0,+\infty)$, where $X$ denotes the $X$-ray transform. As partial progress towards the conjecture, we show, as a straightforward consequence of recently-established decoupling inequalities, that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists a positive constant $C_\epsilon$, which depends only on $\Sigma$ and $\epsilon$, such that for all $R \geq 1$ and all weights $w:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow [0,+\infty)$ we have \begin{equation*}
  \int_{B_R} |\widehat{gd\sigma}|^2w \leq C_\epsilon R^\epsilon \sup_T \left(\int _T w^{\frac{n+1}{2}}\right)^{\frac{2}{n+1}}\int |g|^2,
  \end{equation*}
  where $T$ ranges over the family of all tubes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of dimensions $R^{1/2} \times \dots \times R^{1/2} \times R$. From this we deduce the Mizohata--Takeuchi conjecture with an $R^{\frac{n-1}{n+1}}$-loss; i.e., that \begin{equation*}
  \int_{B_R} |\widehat{gd\sigma}|^2w \leq C_\epsilon R^{\frac{n-1}{n+1}+ \epsilon}\|Xw\|_\infty\int |g|^2
  \end{equation*}
  for any ball $B_R$ of radius $R$ and any $\epsilon&gt;0$. The power $(n-1)/(n+1)$ here cannot be replaced by anything smaller unless properties of $\widehat{gd\sigma}$ beyond 'decoupling axioms' are exploited. We also provide estimates which improve this inequality under various conditions on the weight, and discuss some new cases where the conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Convergence in total variation for the kinetic Langevin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove non asymptotic total variation estimates for the kinetic Langevin algorithm in high dimension when the target measure satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality and has gradient Lipschitz potential. The main point is that the estimate improves significantly upon the corresponding bound for the non kinetic version of the algorithm, due to Dalalyan. In particular the dimension dependence drops from $O(n)$ to $O(\sqrt n)$.</description>
