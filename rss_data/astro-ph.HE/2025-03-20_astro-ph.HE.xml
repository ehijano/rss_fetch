      <title>Search for dark matter subhalos among unassociated Fermi-LAT sources in presence of dataset shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for dark matter (DM) annihilating subhalos of the Milky Way halo among the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) unassociated sources. We construct, for the first time, a statistical model of the unassociated sources at latitudes above 10 degrees. The latter is built as a combination of both DM annihilation subhalos as well as Galactic and extragalactic astrophysical components. The astrophysical components are constructed based on distributions of associated sources, while the distribution of DM subhalos is derived from Monte Carlo simulations. In this model we take into account the differences in the distributions of associated and unassociated sources including both covariate and prior probability shifts (both being forms of ``dataset shifts''). Previous searches of DM subhalos were based on classify-and-count strategies, while the approach adopted in this work is based on quantification learning, which allows one to determine a well-defined statistical interpretation of the contribution of a population of DM subhalos to the unassociated Fermi-LAT sources. In the $b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel and for a range of DM masses from 10 GeV to 1 TeV, we don't find a significant contribution from DM subhalos and derive a statistical 95% confidence upper limit on the DM annihilation cross section in this channel. While the derived limits are consistent with previous classify-and-count approaches, our generative statistical model opens new avenues for population studies of Fermi-LAT sources and, more generally, for searches of anomalies on top of backgrounds in presence of statistical and systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>The curious case of EP241021a: Unraveling the mystery of its exceptional rebrightening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are a rare and poorly understood phenomenon with a variety of possible progenitors. The launch of the Einstein Probe (EP) mission has facilitated a rapid increase in the real-time discovery and follow-up of FXTs. We focus on the recent EP discovered transient EP241021a, which shows a peculiar panchromatic behavior. We obtained optical and near-infrared multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the Fraunhofer Telescope at Wendelstein Observatory, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope over the first 100 days of its evolution. EP241021a was discovered by EP as a soft X-ray trigger, but was not detected at gamma-ray frequencies. The observed soft X-ray prompt emission spectrum is consistent with non-thermal radiation, which requires at least a mildly relativistic outflow with bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma \gtrsim 4$. The optical and near-infrared lightcurve has a two component behavior where an initially fading component $\sim t^{-1}$ turns to a rise steeper than $\sim t^{4}$ after a few days before peaking at $M_r\approx -22$ mag and quickly returning to the initial decay. The peak absolute magnitude is the most luminous optical emission associated to an FXT, superseding EP240414a. Standard supernova models are unable to reproduce either the absolute magnitude or rapid timescale ($&lt;2$ d) of the rebrightening. The X-ray, optical and near-infrared spectral energy distributions display a red color $r-J\approx 1$ mag, and point to a non-thermal origin ($\nu^{-1}$) for the broadband emission. By considering a gamma-ray burst as a plausible scenario, we favor a refreshed shock as the cause of the rebrightening. This is consistent with the inference of an at least mildly relativistic outflow based on the prompt trigger. Our results suggest a likely link between EP discovered FXTs and low luminosity gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the Very-High-Energy Diffuse $\gamma$-Ray Emission: The Case for Galactic Source Cocoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The secondary/primary cosmic-ray ratios and the diffuse backgrounds of gamma rays and neutrinos provide us with complementary information about the transport of Galactic cosmic rays. We use the recent measurement of the diffuse gamma ray background in the $\sim \rm TeV -\rm PeV$ range by LHAASO and of the very high energy diffuse neutrino background from the Galactic disc by IceCube to show that CRs may be accumulating an approximately energy independent grammage $X\sim 0.4\, \rm g \, \rm cm^{-2}$, in regions where gamma rays and neutrinos are produced with a hard spectrum, resembling the source spectrum. We speculate that this grammage reflects the early stages of cosmic ray transport around sources, in so-called cocoons, where particles spend $\sim 0.3\, \rm Myr$ before starting their journey in the Galactic environment.</description>

      <title>Stellar $\beta^{-}$-decay rate of $^{63}$Ni and its impact on the ${s}$-process nucleosynthesis in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\beta^{-}$-decay rate of $^{63}$Ni, an important branching point, affects the subsequent nucleosynthesis in the weak component of the slow-neutron capture process (weak $s$-process). To evaluate the impact of the uncertainties of stellar lifetime of $^{63}$Ni on abundances, we calculate the contribution to $\beta^{-}$-decay rates from its excited states using the large-scale shell model with various interactions and also explore the atomic effects in the highly ionized plasma. In the core He burning stage and the shell C burning stage of massive stars, our new rates can be larger than those from Takahashi and Yokoi(1987) by up to a factor of 4 and 6, respectively. We evaluate the impact of the stellar decay rates of $^{63}$Ni on the nucleosynthesis of $A=60\sim90$ in a star with an initial mass of 25 $M_{\bigodot}$ and solar metalicity. We find that the new rates can lead to the abundance changes of $^{64}$Ni, $^{63}$Cu, $^{65}$Cu, $^{64}$Zn, $^{66}$Zn, $^{67}$Zn, and $^{68}$Zn by up to $18\%$, $14\%$, $7\%$, $98\%$, $16\%$, $15\%$, and $13\%$, respectively, after the shell C burning stage at the Lagrangian mass coordinate $M_{r}=2M_{\bigodot}$. The enhancement of the decay rate of $^{63}$Ni increases the weak $s$-process efficiency of nuclei after $^{65}$Cu.</description>

      <title>Discrete treatment of inverse Compton scattering: implications on parameter estimation in gamma-ray astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gamma-ray astronomy and cosmic-ray physics, the continuous approximation of inverse Compton scattering (ICS) is widely adopted to model the evolution of electron energy. However, when the initial electron energy approaches $\sim100$ TeV, the discrete nature of ICS becomes prominent, and the energy of evolved electrons should be considered as a broad distribution rather than a deterministic value. By simulating the evolution paths of individual electrons under ICS, we capture this discrete nature and demonstrate that when the electron injection spectrum exhibits a high-energy cutoff, the correct discrete treatment yields a higher cutoff energy in the evolved spectrum compared to the continuous approximation. Applying the discrete ICS treatment to interpret the gamma-ray spectrum of the Geminga pulsar halo measured by HAWC, we find that the inferred cutoff energy of the injection spectrum is correspondingly lower than that derived using the continuous approximation at a $95\%$ confidence level. This suggests that the systematic bias introduced by the approximation has exceeded the measurement precision. We also expect the application of the discrete ICS correction in the PeV regime using the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source 1LHAASO J1954+2836u as a case study, pointing out that adopting the continuous approximation may considerably overestimate the electron acceleration capability of the source.</description>

      <title>A constraint on superheavy elements of the GRB-kilonova AT 2023vfi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the kilonova (KN) AT 2017gfo, accompanying the gravitational wave event GW170817, provides crucial insight into the synthesis of heavy elements during binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Following this landmark event, another KN was detected in association with the second-brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, GRB 230307A, and subsequently confirmed by observations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work, we conduct an end-to-end simulation to analyze the temporal evolution of the KN AT 2023vfi associated with GRB 230307A, and constrain the abundances of superheavy elements produced. We find that the temporal evolution of AT 2023vfi is similar to AT 2017gfo in the first week post-burst. Additionally, the \textit{r}-process nuclide abundances of lanthanide-rich ejecta, derived from numerical relativity simulations of BNS mergers, can also successfully interpret the temporal evolution of the KN with the lanthanide-rich ejecta mass of $0.02 M_\odot$, which is consistent with the mass range of dynamical ejecta from numerical simulations in literature. Both findings strongly suggest the hypothesis that GRB 230307A originated from a BNS merger, similar to AT 2017gfo. Based on the first time observation of the KN for JWST, we are able to constrain the superheavy elements of another KN following AT 2017gfo. The pre-radioactive-decay abundances of the superheavy nuclides: $^{222}$Rn, $^{223}$Ra, $^{224}$Ra and $^{225}$Ac, are estimated to be at least on the order of $1 \times 10^{-5}$. These abundance estimates provide valuable insight into the synthesis of superheavy elements in BNS mergers, contributing to our understanding of astrophysical \textit{r}-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The active galaxies of Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the $Euclid$ Quick Release (Q1) fields. For each $Euclid$ source we collect multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy information from Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), $Gaia$, Dark Energy Survey (DES), Wise-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), $Spitzer$, Dark Energy Survey (DESI), and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), including spectroscopic redshift from public compilations. We investigate the AGN contents of the Q1 fields by applying selection criteria using $Euclid$ colours and WISE-AllWISE cuts finding respectively 292,222 and 65,131 candidates. We also create a high-purity QSO catalogue based on $Gaia$ DR3 information containing 1971 candidates. Furthermore, we utilise the collected spectroscopic information from DESI to perform broad-line and narrow-line AGN selections, leading to a total of 4392 AGN candidates in the Q1 field. We investigate and refine the Q1 probabilistic random forest QSO population, selecting a total of 180,666 candidates. Additionally, we perform SED fitting on a subset of sources with available $z_{\text{spec}}$, and by utilizing the derived AGN fraction, we identify a total of 7766 AGN candidates. We discuss purity and completeness of the selections and define two new colour selection criteria ($JH$_$I_{\text{E}}Y$ and $I_{\text{E}}H$_$gz$) to improve on purity, finding 313,714 and 267,513 candidates respectively in the Q1 data. We find a total of 229,779 AGN candidates equivalent to an AGN surface density of 3641 deg$^{-2}$ for $18&lt;I_{\text{E}}\leq 24.5$, and a subsample of 30,422 candidates corresponding to an AGN surface density of 482 deg$^{-2}$ when limiting the depth to $18&lt;I_{\text{E}}\leq 22$. The surface density of AGN recovered from this work is in line with predictions based on the AGN X-ray luminosity functions.</description>

      <title>Orbital eccentricity in a neutron star - black hole binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars provides a unique opportunity to discern information about their astrophysical environment. Two signatures that are considered powerful tracers to distinguish between different binary formation channels are general-relativistic spin-induced orbital precession and orbital eccentricity. Both effects leave characteristic imprints in the gravitational-wave signal that can be extracted from observations. To date, neither precession nor eccentricity have been discerned in neutron star - black hole binaries. Here we report the first measurement of orbital eccentricity in a neutron star - black hole binary. Using, for the first time, a waveform model that incorporates precession and eccentricity, we perform Bayesian inference on the event GW200105 and infer a median orbital eccentricity of $e_{20}\sim 0.145$ at an orbital period of $0.1$s, excluding zero at more than $99\%$ confidence. We find inconclusive evidence for the presence of precession, consistent with previous, non-eccentric results. Our result implies a fraction of these binaries will exhibit orbital eccentricity even at small separations, suggesting formation through mechanisms involving dynamical interactions beyond isolated binary evolution. Future observations will reveal the contribution of eccentric neutron star - black hole binaries to the total merger rate across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Ejecta Mass During the Search for Kilonovae Associated with Neutron Star-Black Hole Mergers: A case study of S230518h, GW230529, S230627c and the Low-Significance Candidate S240422ed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers, detectable via their gravitational-wave (GW) emission, are expected to produce kilonovae (KNe). Four NSBH candidates have been identified and followed-up by more than fifty instruments since the start of the fourth GW Observing Run (O4), in May 2023, up to July 2024; however, no confirmed associated KN has been detected. This study evaluates ejecta properties from multi-messenger observations to understand the absence of detectable KN: we use GW public information and joint observations taken from 05.2023 to 07.2024 (LVK, ATLAS, DECam, GECKO, GOTO, GRANDMA, SAGUARO, TESS, WINTER, ZTF). First, our analysis on follow-up observation strategies shows that, on average, more than 50% of the simulated KNe associated with NSBH mergers reach their peak luminosity around one day after merger in the $g,r,i$- bands, which is not necessarily covered for each NSBH GW candidate. We also analyze the trade-off between observation efficiency and the intrinsic properties of the KN emission, to understand the impact on how these constraints affect our ability to detect the KN, and underlying ejecta properties for each GW candidate. In particular, we can only confirm the kilonova was not missed for 1% of the GW230529 and S230627c sky localization region, given the large sky localization error of GW230529 and the large distance for S230627c and, their respective KN faint luminosities. More constraining, for S230518h, we infer the dynamical ejecta and post-merger disk wind ejecta $m_{dyn}, m_{wind}$ $&lt;$ $0.03$ $M_\odot$ and the viewing angle $\theta&gt;25^\circ$. Similarly, the non-astrophysical origin of S240422ed is likely further confirmed by the fact that we would have detected even a faint KN at the time and presumed distance of the S240422ed event candidate, within a minimum 45% credible region of the sky area, that can be larger depending on the KN scenario.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Supernova Remnants and Candidates in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a star formation rate of order 0.4 M$_\odot $ yr$^{-1}$, M31 should have significant population of supernova remnants (SNRs), and, in fact, 156 SNR and SNR candidates have been suggested by Lee et al. (2014) by searching for nebulae with elevated [SII]/H${\alpha}$ ratios in narrow band images. Here we use a combination of low and high resolution optical spectroscopy obtained with Hectospec on the MMT to characterize 152 of these nebulae. Of these candidates, we find 93 nebulae that have [SII]/H${\alpha}$ ratios that exceed 0.4, the traditional ratio used to separate SNRs from HII regions, strongly suggesting that at least these objects are SNRs. Our high resolution spectroscopy reveals 108 nebulae that have velocity widths in H${\alpha} $ (full-width at 20% peak flux) that exceed 50 km s$^{-1}$, significantly larger than found in HII regions. There are 72 objects that satisfy both tests. Here we discuss the spectroscopic characteristics of all of the objects in our sample, and the likelihood that other objects in the sample of Lee et al. are also SNRs, and we briefly consider confirmation by X-ray, radio and UV observations. We also discuss several new candidates that have been identified serendipitously in the course of examining a large amount of archival Hectospec data.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Magnetars: Exploring Type-I and Type-II States in Toroidal Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first two-dimensional general-relativistic analysis of superconducting regions in axially symmetric highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) models with toroidal magnetic fields. We investigate the topology and distribution of type-II and type-I superconducting regions for varying toroidal magnetic field strengths and stellar masses by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations using the XNS code. Our results reveal that the outer cores of low- to intermediate-mass magnetars sustain superconductivity over larger regions compared to higher-mass stars with non-trivial distribution of type-II and type-I regions. Consistent with previous one-dimensional (1D) models, we find that regardless of the gravitational mass, the inner cores of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields are devoid of $S$-wave proton superconductivity. Furthermore, these models contain non-superconducting, torus-shaped regions - a novel feature absent in previous 1D studies. Finally, we speculate on the potential indirect effects of superconductivity on continuous gravitational wave emissions from millisecond pulsars, such as PSR J1843-1113, highlighting their relevance for future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Rotating Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Black Hole as a Particle Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similar to particle accelerators, black holes also have the ability to accelerate particles, generating significant amounts of energy through particle collisions. In this study, we examine the horizon and spacetime structures of a rotating black hole within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity. Additionally, we extend the analysis to explore particle collisions and energy extraction near this black hole using the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. Our findings reveal that the mass and angular momentum of the colliding particles significantly influence the center of mass energy, more so than the parameters of the black hole itself. Furthermore, we apply the Banados-Silk-West mechanism to massless particles, particularly photons, while disregarding their intrinsic spin in plasma; an aspect that has not been previously explored. The Banados-Silk-West mechanism cannot be directly applied, as the refractive index condition only permits photon propagation, meaning that massive particles in vacuum cannot be included in this study. We derive the propagation conditions for photons and analyze photon collisions by treating them as massive particles in a dispersive medium. The impact of the plasma parameter on the extracted center of mass energy is also examined. Our results show that the plasma parameter has a relatively weak and unchanged effect on the center of mass energy across all cases, indicating that energy losses due to friction within the medium are a contributing factor.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Hall Effect Implementations in Hall-Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is no standard numerical implementation of the Hall effect, which is one of the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects. Numerical instability arises when a simple implementation is used, in which the Hall electric field is added to the electric field to update magnetic fields without further modifications to the numerical scheme. In this paper, several implementations proposed in the literature are compared to identify an approach that provides stable and accurate results. We consider two types of implementations of the Hall effect. One is a modified version of the Harten-Lax-van Leer method (Hall-HLL) in which the phase speeds of whistler waves are adopted as the signal speeds; the other involves adding a fourth-order hyper-resistivity to a Hall-MHD code. Based on an extensive series of test calculations, we found that hyper-resistivity yields more accurate results than the Hall-HLL, particularly in problems where the whisler-wave timescale is shorter than the the timescale of physical processes of interest. Through both von Neumann stability analysis and numerical experiments, an appropriate coefficient for the hyper-resistivity is determined.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Astrometry of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey for Precise Localisation of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short, intense radio signals from distant astrophysical sources, and their accurate localisation is crucial for probing their origins and utilising them as cosmological tools. This study focuses on improving the astrometric precision of FRBs discovered by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by correcting systematic positional errors in the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), which is used as a primary reference for ASKAP FRB localisation. We present a detailed methodology for refining astrometry in two RACS epochs (RACS-Low1 and RACS-Low3) through crossmatching with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue. The uncorrected RACS-Low1 and RACS-Low3 catalogues had significant astrometric offsets, with all-sky median values of $0.58''$ in RA and $-0.26''$ in Dec. (RACS-Low1) and $0.29''$ in RA and $1.24''$ in Dec. (RACS-Low3), with a substantial and direction-dependent scatter around these values. After correction, the median offset was completely eliminated, and the 68\% confidence interval in the all-sky residuals was reduced to $0.2''$ or better for both surveys. By validating the corrected catalogues against other, independent radio surveys, we conclude that the individual corrected RACS source positions are accurate to a 1-$\sigma$ confidence level of $0.3''$ over the bulk of the survey area, degrading slightly to $0.4''$ near the Galactic plane. This work lays the groundwork to extend our corrections to the full RACS catalogue that will enhance future radio observations, particularly for FRB studies.</description>

      <title>Photon Absorption in a Doubly Special Relativity Model with Undeformed Free Propagation and Total Momentum Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of a dynamical framework within doubly special relativity theories has impeded the development of a corresponding phenomenology of modified interactions. In this work we show that in a model based on the classical basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e and total momentum conservation, one has a well-defined cross section of the photon-photon annihilation process, once a prescription for the channel treatment is set. The modification of the interaction can lead to observable effects in the opacity of the Universe to very high-energy gamma rays when the gamma-ray energy approaches the energy scale of the deformation. The magnitude and observability of this deformation are examined as functions of the gamma-ray energy and source distance.</description>

      <title>Connecting a Magnetized Disk to a Convective Low-mass Protostar: A Global Three-dimensional Model of Boundary Layer Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early stages of star formation, boundary layer accretion, where protostars accrete material from disks extending down to their surfaces, plays a crucial role. Understanding how a magneto-rotational-instability (MRI)-active disk connects to a protostar's surface remains a significant challenge. To investigate the mechanisms of mass and angular momentum transfer, we develop a global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of boundary layer accretion around a magnetized, convective low-mass protostar. Our results reveal that angular momentum transport mechanisms transition significantly from the outer MRI-active disk to the protostellar surface. Various mechanisms--MRI, spiral shocks, coronal accretion, jets, and disk winds--contribute to angular momentum transfer, resulting in three distinct disk structures: (1) the MRI-active disk, (2) the transition layer, and (3) the boundary layer. The simulated protostar is strongly magnetized due to the accumulation of the disk fields, wrapping by disk toroidal fields, and stellar dynamo activity. Magnetic concentrations analogous to starspots form on the protostar and interact with the rotating disk gas to generate spiral shocks. These shocks play a key role in driving accretion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of global MHD models for a comprehensive understanding of angular momentum transport. Additionally, we identify explosive events triggered by magnetic reconnection in both the protostar and the disk atmosphere. We also find decretion flows in the disk midplane, which may be important for the radial transport of refractory materials, such as Calcium-Aluminium-rich Inclusions (CAIs) precursor gas, to the outer disk.</description>

      <title>No Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Neutrino Sky Upholds Lorentz Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) would upend the foundations of modern physics. Because LIV effects grow with energy, high-energy astrophysical neutrinos provide the most sensitive tests of Lorentz invariance in the neutrino sector. We examine an understudied yet phenomenologically rich LIV signature: compass asymmetries, where neutrinos of different flavors propagate preferentially along different directions. Using the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the abundances of $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$, and $\nu_{\tau}$ across the sky, we find no evidence of LIV-induced flavor anisotropy in 7.5 years of IceCube High-Energy Starting Events. Thus, we place upper limits on the values of hundreds of LIV parameters with operator dimensions 2-8, tightening existing limits by orders of magnitude and bounding hundreds of parameters for the first time.</description>

Abstract: Among several dozen known repeating Fast radio bursts (FRBs), those precisely localized offer the best opportunities to explore their multi-wavelength counterparts, which are key to uncovering their origins. Here we report our X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and optical observations with the $Swift$ satellite of the repeating FRB 20190520B, in coordination with simultaneous radio observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our aim was to detect potentially associated multi-wavelength bursts and identify any persistent multi-wavelength counterpart to the associated persistent radio source (PRS). While a total of 10 radio bursts were detected by FAST during the $Swift$ observations, we detected no X-ray, UV, or optical bursts in accompany with the radio bursts. We obtained the energy upper limits ($3\sigma$) on any multi-wavelength bursts as follows: $5.03 \times 10^{47}$ erg in the hard X-ray band (15--150 keV), $7.98 \times 10^{45}$ erg in the soft X-ray band (0.3--10 keV), and $4.51 \times 10^{44}$ erg in the U band (3465\AA), respectively. The energy ratio between soft X-ray (0.3--10 keV) and radio emission of the bursts is constrained as $&lt;6\times10^{7}$, and the ratio between optical (U band) and radio as $&lt;1.19\times10^{6}$. We detect no multi-wavelength counterpart to the PRS. The 3$\sigma$ luminosity upper limits are 1.04$\times10^{47}$ (15--150 keV), 8.81$\times10^{42}$ (0.3--10 keV), 9.26$\times10^{42}$ (UVW1), and 2.54$\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (U), respectively. We show that the PRS is much more radio loud than representative pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, extended jets of Galactic X-ray binaries, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, suggestive of boosted radio emission of the PRS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN) Mkn 590 recently underwent a sudden re-ignition, marked by substantial increases in optical/UV and X-ray continuum flux since last couple of years. Swift-XRT observations revealed the re-emergence of a soft X-ray excess (SXE) as the source transitioned from a low-flux state in July 2023 to a significantly higher flux state in October 2024. This evolution was in response to an order-of-magnitude increase in extreme-UV (EUV) continuum emission, detected by Swift-UVOT. Follow-up optical spectra from FLOYDS Faulkes confirmed the enhancement of dynamically broadened Balmer lines, He II emission, and Fe II complex. As the Eddington fraction increased by a factor of $\sim$ 20 over the last 20 months, we found clear evidence of formation of a warm corona, strongly linked to the cold accretion disc underneath. Based on our multi-wavelength study on recent data, we propose that Mkn 590 is currently becoming a Seyfert-1.2, similar to its state in 1990s.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in astrophysical gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from proton-proton cross-sections in the GeV to PeV range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of Cosmic Ray (CR) sources represents one of the biggest and long-standing questions in astrophysics. Direct measurements of cosmic rays cannot provide directional information due to their deflection in (extra)galactic magnetic fields. Cosmic-ray interactions at the sources lead to the production of high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos, which, combined in the multimessenger picture, are the key to identifying the origins of CRs and estimating transport properties. While gamma-ray observations alone raise the question of whether their origin is hadronic or leptonic, the observation of high-energy neutrino emission directly points to the presence of CR hadrons. To identify the emission signatures from acceleration and transport effects a proper modeling of those interactions in a transport framework is needed. Significant work has been done to tune the production cross sections to accelerator data and different models exist that put the exact evolution of the Monte-Carlo generated showers into a statistical approach of a probabilistic description of the production of the final states of the showers relevant for astrophysical observations.
  In this work, we present the implementation of different hadronic interaction (HI) models into the publicly available transport code CRPropa. We apply different descriptions of the HI, trained on observational data in different energy regimes to a nearby, giant molecular cloud and the Galactic diffuse emission. In this case, the resulting gamma-ray and neutrinos fluxes can differ by a factor $\sim 2$ dependent on the choice of the HI model.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Temperature Analytically In Hydrodynamics Simulations with Gas and Radiation Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical hydrodynamics simulations of gases dominated by ideal, nondegenerate matter pressure and thermal radiation pressure in equilibrium entail finding the temperature as part of the evolution. Since the temperature is not typically a variable that is evolved independently, it must be extracted from the the evolved variables (e.g. the rest-mass density and specific internal energy). This extraction requires solving a quartic equation, which, in many applications, is done numerically using an iterative root-finding method. Here we show instead how the equation can be solved analytically and provide explicit expressions for the solution. We also derive Taylor expansions in limiting regimes and discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of the iterative versus analytic approaches to solving the quartic.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave probes of particle dark matter: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various theories of dark matter predict distinctive astrophysical signatures in gravitational-wave sources that could be observed by ground- and space-based laser interferometers. Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering. This review outlines these dark matter candidates, their observational signatures, and approaches for their detection.</description>

      <title>Constraints on LIGO/Virgo Compact Object Mergers from Late-time Radio Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from a search for radio afterglows of compact object mergers conducted with the Australian SKA Pathfinder. We used data from four epochs of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey to search compact binary merger localization regions observed during the LIGO/Virgo O2, and O3 observing runs. Our investigation focused on eleven events (published in the GWTC-1, GWTC-2, and GWTC-3 catalogues of gravitational-wave events) with 90\% posterior localisations smaller than $150\,\deg^2$ and $\ge$99\% probabilities of being of astrophysical origin, to identify potential radio afterglow-like transients up to $\lesssim$1500 days post-merger. We identified candidate afterglow-type variable sources in the 90\% localisation for events -- GW190503, GW200202 and GW200208, which were ruled out as unlikely to be related to the corresponding GW event on further analysis. Since we find no likely candidate counterparts, we constrain the inclination angle and the circum-merger density at isotropic equivalent energies ranging from $2\times10^{51} -1\times10^{54}\rm \:erg$. These constraints are based on the assumption that the electron energy distribution in the associated jets follows a power-law index of $ p = 2.2$, with 1% of the shock energy in the magnetic field ($ \epsilon_B = 0.01$) and 10% in the electrons ($\epsilon_e = 0.1$). We discuss the detectability of late-time afterglows as a function of merger distance and inclination angles with millijansky surveys.</description>

      <title>Propagation Times and Energy Losses of Cosmic Protons and Antiprotons in Interplanetary Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the heliospheric modulation of cosmic rays in interplanetary space, focusing on their propagation times and energy losses over the solar cycle. To perform the calculations, we employed a data-driven model based on the stochastic method. Our model was calibrated using time-resolved and energy-resolved data from several missions including AMS-02, PAMELA, EPHIN/SOHO, BESS, and data from Voyager-1. This approach allows us to calculate probability density functions for the propagation time and energy losses of cosmic protons and antiprotons in the heliosphere. Furthermore, we explore the temporal evolution of these probabilities spanning from 1993 to 2018, covering a full 22-year cycle of magnetic polarity, which includes two solar minima and two magnetic reversals. Our calculations were carried out for cosmic protons and antiprotons, enabling us to investigate the role of charge-sign dependent effects in cosmic ray transport. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical processes of cosmic-ray propagation in the heliosphere and contribute to a deeper understanding of the solar modulation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>The EXOD search for faint transients in XMM-Newton observations. Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The XMM-Newton observatory has accumulated a vast archive of over 17,000 X-ray observations over the last 25 years. However, the standard data processing pipelines may fail to detect certain types of transient X-ray sources due to their short-lived or dim nature. Identifying these transient sources is important for understanding the full range of temporal X-ray behaviour, as well as understanding the types of sources that could be routinely detected by future missions such as Athena. This work aims to reprocess XMM-Newton archival observations using newly developed dedicated software in order to identify neglected and missed transient X-ray sources that were not detected by the existing pipeline. We use a new approach that builds upon previous methodologies, by transforming event lists into data cubes, which are then searched for transient variability in short time windows. Our method enhances the detection capabilities in the Poisson regime by accounting for the statistical properties of sparse count rates, and allowing for transient search in previously discarded periods of high background activity. Our reprocessing efforts identified 32,247 variable sources at the 3-sigma level and 4,083 sources at the 5-sigma level in 12,926 XMM archival observations. We highlight four noteworthy sources: A candidate quasi-periodic eruption (QPE), a new magnetar candidate, a previously undetected Galactic hard X-ray burst and a possible X-ray counterpart to a Galactic radio pulsar. Our method demonstrates a new, fast, and effective way to process event list data from XMM-Newton, which is efficient in finding rapid outburst-like or eclipsing behaviour. This technique can be adapted for use with future telescopes, such as Athena, and can be generalised to other photon counting instruments operating in the low-count Poisson regime.</description>

      <title>Association of 220 PeV Neutrino KM3-230213A with Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration released the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been a speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without fixed LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>

      <title>Indirect detection of dark matter absorption in the Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nuclear absorption of dark matter as an alternative to the typical indirect detection search channels of dark matter decay or annihilation. In this scenario, an atomic nucleus transitions to an excited state by absorbing a pseudoscalar dark matter particle and promptly emits a photon as it transitions back to its ground state. The nuclear excitation of carbon and oxygen in the Galactic Center would produce a discrete photon spectrum in the $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV range that could be detected by gamma-ray telescopes. Using the \texttt{BIGSTICK} large-scale shell-model code, we calculate the excitation energies of carbon and oxygen. We constrain the dark matter-nucleus coupling for current COMPTEL data, and provide projections for future experiments AMEGO-X, e-ASTROGAM, and GRAMS for dark matter masses from $\sim$ 10 to 30 MeV. We find the excitation process to be very sensitive to the dark matter mass and find that the future experiments considered would improve constraints on the dark matter-nucleus coupling within an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Adapting a novel framework for rapid inference of massive black hole binaries for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is designed to detect a variety of gravitational-wave events, including mergers of massive black hole binaries, stellar-mass black hole inspirals, and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. LISA's capability to observe signals with high signal-to-noise ratios raises concerns about waveform accuracy. Additionally, its ability to observe long-duration signals will raise the computational cost of Bayesian inference, making it challenging to use costly and novel models with standard stochastic sampling methods without incorporating likelihood and waveform acceleration techniques. In this work, we present our attempt to tackle these issues. We adapt ${\tt RIFT}$ for LISA to take advantage of its embarrassingly parallel architecture, enabling efficient analysis of large datasets with costly gravitational wave models without relying on likelihood or waveform acceleration. We demonstrate that our open-source code can accurately infer parameters of massive black hole binary signals by carrying out a zero-noise injection recovery using the numerical relativity surrogate model ${\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$. By utilizing all available $m\neq0$ modes in the inference, we study the impact of higher modes on LISA data analysis. We study the impact of multiple massive black hole binary signals in a dataset on the inference of a single signal, showing that the selected source's inference remains largely unaffected. Furthermore, we analyze the LDC-1A and blind LDC-2A datasets from the Radler and Sangria challenge of the LISA data challenges. When eschewing specialized hardware, we find ${\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$ injection-recovery takes approximately $20$ hours to complete, while the analysis of Sangria and Radler datasets takes about $10$ hours to complete.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRCam simulations and observations of AGN ionization cones in cosmic noon galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an "ionization cone" that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon ($z\sim2-3$). To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at $z=2-3$ created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby ($z&lt;0.05$) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at $z=2-3$ with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III]$+\mathrm{H}\beta$ emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at $z=2.4-3.4$ in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III]$+\mathrm{H}\beta$ morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of $1-2.5$ kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of $\sim 2$.</description>
