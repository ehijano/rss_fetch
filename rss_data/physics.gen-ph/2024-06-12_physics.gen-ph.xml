      <title>A Hybrid Euclidean-Lorentzian Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited velocity in a geometry of Lorentzian signature, seem to prevent the universe to reach thermodynamic equilibrium as suggested by the cosmic microwave background. Thus it was suggested that the universe which was initially minuscule has reached a more considerable radius in a short duration by a process known as cosmic inflation. However, to drive such a process have led to the suggestion of an ad-hoc scalar field the inflaton, which has no purpose in nature other than driving the cosmic inflation field and then stopping it once the universe reached the right size. In a recent paper it was shown that rapid expansion can occur without postulating an inflation by following Hawking's suggestion and assuming that primordially the metric of the universe had an Euclidean signature, in which case velocity is not limited and thermalization and rapid expansion are derived without the need to assume an ad-hoc field. However, while in the previous work emphasis was put on the dynamics and physical statistics of the particles in a Euclidean space vs. Lorentzian space in which both spaces were given. No mathematical model was given regarding the development of current Lorentzian space-time from the early Euclidean space-time, and how fundamental problems such as the space-time singularity and the homogeneity of the CMB can be solved in the hybrid Euclidean-Lorentzian picture. This lacuna is to be rectified in the current paper.</description>

      <title>Solution of the dark matter riddle within standard model physics: From black holes, galaxies and clusters to cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is postulated that the energy density of the (quantum) vacuum acts firstly as dark energy and secondly as a part of dark matter. Assisted by electric fields arising from a small charge mismatch in the cosmic plasma, it can condense on mass concentrations. No longer participating in the cosmic expansion, this constitutes ``electro-aether-energy'' (EAE), ``electro-zero-point-energy'' or ``electro-vacuum-energy'', which solves the dark matter riddle without new physics. A radial electric field of 1 kV/m is predicted in the Galaxy. For proper electric fields, EAE can cover the results deduced with MOND. An instability allows a speedy filling of dark matter cores. Hydrostatic equilibrium in galaxy clusters is obeyed. Flowing in of EAE explains why black holes become supermassive, do not have mass gaps and overcome the final parsec problem. Rupture of charged clouds reduces, e. g., the primordial baryon cloud to the cosmic web. The large coherence scale of the electric field acts as a scaffold for gentle galaxy formation and their vast polar structures. In galaxy merging and bars, there occurs no dynamical friction. At cosmological scales, EAE acts as pressureless dark matter. Its amount increases in time, which likely solves the Hubble tension by its late time physics. A big crunch can occur. Of the large cosmological constant injected at the Big Bang, a small part kept that form, without fine-tuning.</description>
