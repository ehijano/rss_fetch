      <title>NotSoTiny: A Large, Living Benchmark for RTL Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have shown early promise in generating RTL code, yet evaluating their capabilities in realistic setups remains a challenge. So far, RTL benchmarks have been limited in scale, skewed toward trivial designs, offering minimal verification rigor, and remaining vulnerable to data contamination. To overcome these limitations and to push the field forward, this paper introduces NotSoTiny, a benchmark that assesses LLM on the generation of structurally rich and context-aware RTL. Built from hundreds of actual hardware designs produced by the Tiny Tapeout community, our automated pipeline removes duplicates, verifies correctness and periodically incorporates new designs to mitigate contamination, matching Tiny Tapeout release schedule. Evaluation results show that NotSoTiny tasks are more challenging than prior benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in overcoming current limitations of LLMs applied to hardware design, and in guiding the improvement of such promising technology.</description>

      <title>ElfCore: A 28nm Neural Processor Enabling Dynamic Structured Sparse Training and Online Self-Supervised Learning with Activity-Dependent Weight Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present ElfCore, a 28nm digital spiking neural network processor tailored for event-driven sensory signal processing. ElfCore is the first to efficiently integrate: (1) a local online self-supervised learning engine that enables multi-layer temporal learning without labeled inputs; (2) a dynamic structured sparse training engine that supports high-accuracy sparse-to-sparse learning; and (3) an activity-dependent sparse weight update mechanism that selectively updates weights based solely on input activity and network dynamics. Demonstrated on tasks including gesture recognition, speech, and biomedical signal processing, ElfCore outperforms state-of-the-art solutions with up to 16X lower power consumption, 3.8X reduced on-chip memory requirements, and 5.9X greater network capacity efficiency.</description>

      <title>HYLU: Hybrid Parallel Sparse LU Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07690v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces HYLU, a hybrid parallel LU factorization-based general-purpose solver designed for efficiently solving sparse linear systems (Ax=b) on multi-core shared-memory architectures. The key technical feature of HYLU is the integration of hybrid numerical kernels so that it can adapt to various sparsity patterns of coefficient matrices. Tests on 34 sparse matrices from SuiteSparse Matrix Collection reveal that HYLU outperforms Intel MKL PARDISO in the numerical factorization phase by geometric means of 2.04X (for one-time solving) and 2.58X (for repeated solving). HYLU can be downloaded from https://github.com/chenxm1986/hylu.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model for Verilog Code Generation: Literature Review and the Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code generation has emerged as a critical research area at the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of limitations of existing studies. Finally, we have outlined a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities for future research endeavors in LLM-assisted hardware design.</description>

      <title>Designing Spatial Architectures for Sparse Attention: STAR Accelerator via Cross-Stage Tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on self-attention for contextual understanding, demanding high-throughput inference and large-scale token parallelism (LTPP). Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: cross-stage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage compute- and memory-efficient algorithm-hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add-only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2$\times$ speedup and 71.2$\times$ energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1$\times$ energy and 27.1$\times$ area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1$\times$ throughput improvement.</description>

      <title>V-Rex: Real-Time Streaming Video LLM Acceleration via Dynamic KV Cache Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.
  In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.</description>
