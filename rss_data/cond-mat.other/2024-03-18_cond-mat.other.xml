      <title>Emergent Haldane Model and Photon-Valley Locking in Chiral Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of Haldane's topological graphene model in practical materials has presented significant challenges. Here, we propose achieving this model by embedding graphene in chiral cavities, using the asymptotically decoupled framework detailed in Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 153603 (2021)]. Additionally, we introduce an equilibrium strategy for achieving valley polarization in this system with C2-symmetry breaking. Through numerical methods, we quantify the locking of photon numbers with Bloch electrons and calculate the topology-induced imbalance of valley photons. Furthermore, we elucidate that topological phase transition is characterized by the sign change of photon numbers during interband excitation. These findings underscore the remarkable potential of utilizing cavity quantum fluctuations to engineer electronic and photonic properties specific to valleys and topologies, particularly within the realm of strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Modified Steinberg-Guinan elasticity model to describe softening-hardening dual anomaly in vanadium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constitutive models are essential for describing the mechanical behavior of materials under high temperatures and pressures, among which the Steinberg-Guinan (SG) model is widely adopted. Recent work has discovered a peculiar dual anomaly of compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening in the elasticity of compressed vanadium [Phys. Rev. B 104, 134102 (2021)], which is beyond the capability of the SG model to describe. In this work, a modified SG constitutive model is proposed to embody such an anomalous behavior. Elemental vanadium is considered as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of this improved model in describing the dual anomalies of mechanical elasticity. This new variant of the SG model can also be applied to other materials that present an irregular variation in the mechanical elasticity, and is important to faithfully model and simulate the mechanical response of materials under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>The effect of Coulomb assisted hopping on STM signal: extended two site Hubbard model analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study STM signal in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping. We perform an extended two site Hubbard model analysis between the atom on the tip and the atom in the sample nearest to each other. We show that in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping the STM signal depends on several spectral functions thereby complicating its interpretation. Furthermore in the broadband tip limit there are now three different competing rates for the total current (instead of one for the usual two site Hubbard model analysis). We find an exact (within the Fermi golden rule - that is in the limit of weak coupling between tip and sample) an expression for the current as a function of the bias voltage. As an example we apply our calculations to the case of free fermions with a uniform density of states. Even in this simple case there are non-trivial corrections where the dI/dV (the rate of change of the current with respect to bias voltage) is not uniform as a two site (non-extended) Hubbard model analysis would predict.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic order influenced phonon and electron dynamics in MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ through terahertz time-domain spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$, the first topological insulator with inherent magnetic ordering, has attracted significant attention recently for providing a platform to realize several exotic quantum phenomena at relatively higher temperatures. In this work, we have carried out an exhaustive investigation of MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ thin films using THz time-domain spectroscopy. The extracted real THz conductivity displays a strong IR active E$_u$ phonon absorption peak (at $\sim$1.5 THz) merged on top of the Drude-like contributions from bulk and surface electrons. The extracted parameters from the THz conductivity data fitted to the Drude-Fano-Lorentz model, show significant changes in their temperature dependence around the magnetic ordering N\'eel temperature of $\sim$ 25K, which is suggestive of the coupling between magnetic ordering and electronic band structure. The frequency of the E$_u$ phonon displays an anomalous blue-shift with increasing temperatures by $\sim$ 0.1 THz ($\sim$7 %) for MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and $\sim$0.2 THz ($\sim$13 %) for Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ between 7K and 250K. The line-shape of the E$_u$ phonon mode in Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ shows significant Fano asymmetry compared to that of MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$, indicating that Sb doping plays an important role in the Fano interference between the phonons and the electrons, in this system. These results indicate that the anomalous phonon behaviour seen in MBT arise mainly from positive cubic anharmonicity induced self energy parameter, whereas both anharmonicity and the electron phonon coupling are at play in making the relatively higher anomalous blue shift of phonons in MBST. Our studies provide the first comprehensive understanding of the phonon and electron dynamics of MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and Sb doped MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ in the THz range using time-domain THz spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Surface State Dissipation in Confined 3He-A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the power dependence of superfluid Helmholtz resonators in flat (750 and 1800 nm) rectangular channels. In the A-phase of superfluid 3He, we observe a non-linear response for velocities larger than a critical value. The small size of the channels stabilizes a static uniform texture that eliminates dissipative processes produced by changes in the texture. For such a static texture, the lowest velocity dissipative process is due to the pumping of surface bound states into the bulk liquid. We show that the temperature dependence of the critical velocity observed in our devices is consistent with this surface-state dissipation. Characterization of the force-velocity curves of our devices may provide a platform for studying the physics of exotic surface bound states in superfluid $^3$He.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Non-Relativistic Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-relativistic quantum field theory is a framework that describes systems where the velocities are much smaller than the speed of light. A large class of those obey Schr\"{o}dinger invariance, which is the equivalent of the conformal symmetry in the relativistic world. In this review, we pedagogically introduce the main theoretical tools used to study non-relativistic physics: null reduction and $c \rightarrow \infty$ limits, where $c$ is the speed of light. We present a historical overview of non-relativistic wave equations, Jackiw-Pi vortices, the Aharonov-Bohm scattering, and the trace anomaly for a Schr\"{o}dinger scalar. We then review modern developments, including fermions at unitarity, the quantum Hall effect, off-shell actions, and a systematic classification of the trace anomaly. The last part of this review is dedicated to current research topics. We define non-relativistic supersymmetry and a corresponding superspace to covariantly deal with quantum corrections. Finally, we define the Spin Matrix Theory limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is a non-relativistic sector of the duality obtained via a decoupling limit, where a precise matching of the two sides can be achieved.</description>
