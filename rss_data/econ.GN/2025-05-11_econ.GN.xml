      <title>Global Agricultural Competitiveness Index (Gaci) in the Context of Climate Change: A Holistic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impacts of climate change, conflicts, the spread of infectious diseases, and global economic downturns have greatly affected food production, disrupted supply chains, and hindered access to affordable, nutritious food. It poses risks to both local and global food security, in addition to agricultural market competitiveness. Given the increasing concerns about climate change and its implications for global agriculture and food security, evaluating agricultural competitiveness via a composite scale to measure the effects of climate change would be beneficial. This study examined a global agricultural competitiveness index (GACI) framework developed through a systematic review and an expert survey. The results show that most countries experienced a decline in their competitiveness scores with agricultural assessment in the context of the impact of climate change. This framework can serve as a global benchmark for assessing and comparing national and international standing. Furthermore, it can help policy development aimed at promoting sustainable and inclusive agriculture, ultimately contributing to improved global food security.

      <title>GenAI in Entrepreneurship: a systematic review of generative artificial intelligence in entrepreneurship research: current issues and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are recognized to have significant effects on industry and business dynamics, not least because of their impact on the preconditions for entrepreneurship. There is still a lack of knowledge of GenAI as a theme in entrepreneurship research. This paper presents a systematic literature review aimed at identifying and analyzing the evolving landscape of research on the effects of GenAI on entrepreneurship. We analyze 83 peer-reviewed articles obtained from leading academic databases: Web of Science and Scopus. Using natural language processing and unsupervised machine learning techniques with TF-IDF vectorization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and hierarchical clustering, five major thematic clusters are identified: (1) Digital Transformation and Behavioral Models, (2) GenAI-Enhanced Education and Learning Systems, (3) Sustainable Innovation and Strategic AI Impact, (4) Business Models and Market Trends, and (5) Data-Driven Technological Trends in Entrepreneurship. Based on the review, we discuss future research directions, gaps in the current literature, as well as ethical concerns raised in the literature. We highlight the need for more macro-level research on GenAI and LLMs as external enablers for entrepreneurship and for research on effective regulatory frameworks that facilitate business experimentation, innovation, and further technology development.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Governance, Smart Meter Adoption, and Utilities' Energy Efficiency Savings in the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart grids enable the alignment of energy supply and demand, enhance energy efficiency, and raise consumer awareness of energy conservation. Smart meter, a vital technological component of smart grids, enables bidirectional communication between consumers and utility companies. This paper employs the two-stage least squares panel data model to examine the effects of federal funding and state legislative actions on smart meter adoption and the resulting energy efficiency savings in the residential sector of the United States. Additionally, we use machine learning techniques to select the subset of control variables that are influential for smart meter adoption and energy efficiency savings. The findings suggest that both federal financial assistance and state legislative actions have positive effects on smart meter adoption, and the interaction of federal funding and state policy interventions have a significantly greater effect on adoption as compared to the sum of the individual policy instrument alone. Furthermore, there exists a positive association between the adoption rate and energy efficiency savings. This study presents empirical evidence that underscores the significance of multi-level governance as an effective means for policy integration regarding smart meter adoptions, and it discusses the policy implications for grid modernization and environmental policies.</description>

      <title>Who's at Risk? Effects of Inflation on Unemployment Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We empirically investigate the distributional effects of inflation on workers' unemployment tail risks using instrumental variable quantile regression. We find that supply-driven inflation disproportionately raises unemployment tail risks for cyclically vulnerable workers in both the short and medium term, while demand-driven inflation has differential effects -- limited to race and reason for unemployment -- only in the medium term. Demand-boosting policies, including monetary policy, can inadvertently widen those disparities through the inflation channel, underscoring the importance of inflation stabilization in promoting equitable growth in the labor market. Our findings could be explained structurally by heterogeneity in experienced inflation and wage inflation expectations.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Dynamics of the Coffee Value Chain in Davao del Sur: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates the coffee value chain dynamics in Davao del Sur using an agent-based model. Three main factors driving interactions among key players were identified: trust, risk, and transaction costs. The model was constructed using NetLogo 6.3.0, and data from a survey questionnaire collected three data points from BACOFA members. Five cases were explored, with each scenario simulated 1000 times. Findings suggest that producers often sell to the market rather than the cooperative due to higher prices. However, producers tend to prioritize trust in buyers and their risk attitude, leading to increased sales to the cooperative. The producer's risk attitude significantly influences their decision-making, affecting performance outcomes such as loans, demand, and price changes. All three factors play a role and exert varying impacts on the value chain. So, the stakeholders' decisions on prioritizing factors in improving relationships depend on their priorities. Nonetheless, simulations show that establishing a harmonious system benefiting all parties is possible. However, achieving this requires adjustments to demand, pricing, trust, and risk attitudes of key players, which may not align with the preferences of some parties in reality.</description>

      <title>Predicting Poverty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poverty prediction models are used to address missing data issues in a variety of contexts such as poverty profiling, targeting with proxy-means tests, cross-survey imputations such as poverty mapping, top and bottom incomes studies, or vulnerability analyses. Based on the models used by this literature, this paper conducts a study by artificially corrupting data clear of missing incomes with different patterns and shares of missing incomes. It then compares the capacity of classic econometric and machine learning models to predict poverty under different scenarios with full information on observed and unobserved incomes, and the true counterfactual poverty rate. Random forest provides more consistent and accurate predictions under most but not all scenarios.</description>

      <title>Competition and Collusion in Two-Sided Markets with an Outside Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce pricing formulas for competition and collusion models of two-sided markets with an outside option. For the competition model, we find conditions under which prices and consumer surplus may increase or decrease if the outside option utility increases. Therefore, neglecting the outside option can lead to either overestimation or underestimation of these equilibrium outputs. Comparing collusion to competition, we find that in cases of small cross-side externalities, collusion results in decreased normalized net deterministic utilities, reduced market participation and increased price, on both sides of the market. Additionally, we observe that as the number of platforms increases in the competition model, market participation rises. Profits, however, decrease when the net normalized deterministic utility is sufficiently low but increase when it is high. Furthermore, we identify specific conditions that quantify the change of price and consumer surplus when the competition increases.</description>
