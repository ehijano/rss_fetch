      <title>Safe Barrier-Constrained Control of Uncertain Systems via Event-triggered Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While control barrier functions are employed to ensure in addressing safety, control synthesis methods based on them generally rely on accurate system dynamics. This is a critical limitation, since the dynamics of complex systems are often not fully known. Supervised machine learning techniques hold great promise for alleviating this weakness by inferring models from data. We propose a novel control barrier function-based framework for safe control through event-triggered learning, which switches between prioritizing control performance and improving model accuracy based on the uncertainty of the learned model. By updating a Gaussian process model with training points gathered online, the approach guarantees the feasibility of control barrier function conditions with high probability, such that safety can be ensured in a data-efficient manner. Furthermore, we establish the absence of Zeno behavior in the triggering scheme, and extend the algorithm to sampled-data realizations by accounting for inter-sampling effects. The effectiveness of the proposed approach and theory is demonstrated in simulations.</description>

      <title>Internet of Things Networks: Enabling Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of sensors deployed in the world is expected to explode in the near future. At this moment, nearly 30 billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices are connected and this number is expected to double in the next four years. While not all of these are battery powered, as technology becomes smaller and mobility becomes more important to consumers, soon a larger portion will be. This forecast predicts that the number of machine to machine (M2M) devices will have the largest increase, representing nearly 50% of all devices in 2023.</description>

      <title>Economic Optimal Power Management of Second-Life Battery Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-life battery energy storage systems (SL-BESS) are an economical means of long-duration grid energy storage. They utilize retired battery packs from electric vehicles to store and provide electrical energy at the utility scale. However, they pose critical challenges in achieving optimal utilization and extending their remaining useful life. These complications primarily result from the constituent battery packs' inherent heterogeneities in terms of their size, chemistry, and degradation. This paper proposes an economic optimal power management approach to ensure the cost-minimized operation of SL-BESS while adhering to safety regulations and maintaining a balance between the power supply and demand. The proposed approach takes into account the costs associated with the degradation, energy loss, and decommissioning of the battery packs. In particular, we capture the degradation costs of the retired battery packs through a weighted average Ah-throughput aging model. The presented model allows us to quantify the capacity fading for second-life battery packs for different operating temperatures and C-rates. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct extensive simulations on a SL-BESS consisting of various heterogeneous retired battery packs in the context of grid operation. The results offer novel insights into SL-BESS operation and highlight the importance of prudent power management to ensure economically optimal utilization.</description>

      <title>Deep DeePC: Data-enabled predictive control with low or no online optimization using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) is a data-driven control algorithm that utilizes data matrices to form a non-parametric representation of the underlying system, predicting future behaviors and generating optimal control actions. DeePC typically requires solving an online optimization problem, the complexity of which is heavily influenced by the amount of data used, potentially leading to expensive online computation. In this paper, we leverage deep learning to propose a highly computationally efficient DeePC approach for general nonlinear processes, referred to as Deep DeePC. Specifically, a deep neural network is employed to learn the DeePC vector operator, which is an essential component of the non-parametric representation of DeePC. This neural network is trained offline using historical open-loop input and output data of the nonlinear process. With the trained neural network, the Deep DeePC framework is formed for online control implementation. At each sampling instant, this neural network directly outputs the DeePC operator, eliminating the need for online optimization as conventional DeePC. The optimal control action is obtained based on the DeePC operator updated by the trained neural network. To address constrained scenarios, a constraint handling scheme is further proposed and integrated with the Deep DeePC to handle hard constraints during online implementation. The efficacy and superiority of the proposed Deep DeePC approach are demonstrated using two benchmark process examples.</description>

      <title>System-level thermal and electrical modeling of battery systems for electric aircraft design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a framework for simulating the electrical power consumption of an 8-seater electric aircraft equipped with high-energy-density NMC Lithium-ion cells. We propose an equivalent circuit model (ECM) to capture the thermal and electrical battery behavior. Furthermore, we assess the need for a battery thermal management system (BTMS) by determining heat generation at the cell level and optimize BTMS design to minimize energy consumption over a predefined flight regime. The proposed baseline battery design includes a 304-kWh battery system with BTMS, ensuring failure redundancy through two parallel switched battery banks. Simulation results explore the theoretical flight range without BTMS and reveal advantages in increasing battery capacity under specific conditions. Optimization efforts focus on BTMS design, highlighting the superior performance of water cooling over air cooling. However, the addition of a 9.9 kW water-cooled BTMS results in a 16.5% weight increase (387 kg) compared to no BTMS, reducing the simulated range of the aircraft from 480 km to 410 km. Lastly, we address a heating-induced thermal runaway scenario, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed battery design in preventing thermal runaway.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer optimisation of hybrid energy storage systems for electric vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a multi-layer optimization framework for hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) for passenger electric vehicles to increase the battery system's performance by combining multiple cell chemistries. Specifically, we devise a battery model capturing voltage dynamics, temperature and lifetime degradation solely using data from manufacturer datasheets, and jointly optimize the capacity distribution between the two batteries and the power split, for a given drive cycle and HESS topology. The results show that the lowest energy consumption is obtained with a hybrid solution consisting of a NCA-NMC combination, since this provides the best trade-off between efficiency and added weight.</description>

      <title>Energy Control of Grid-forming Energy Storage based on Bandwidth Separation Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced inertia in power system introduces more operation risks and challenges to frequency regulation. The existing virtual inertia and frequency support control are restricted by the normally non-dispatchable energy resources behind the power electronic converters. In this letter, an improved virtual synchronous machine (VSM) control based on energy storage is proposed, considering the limitation of state-of-charge. The steady-state energy consumed by energy storage in inertia, damping and frequency services is investigated. Based on bandwidth separation principle, an energy recovery control is designed to restore the energy consumed, thereby ensuring constant energy reserve. Effectiveness of the proposed control and design is verified by comprehensive simulation results.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Network Optimization under Bandit Feedback: Maximizing Utility in Non-Stationary Multi-Hop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Network Optimization (SNO) concerns scheduling in stochastic queueing systems. It has been widely studied in network theory. Classical SNO algorithms require network conditions to be stationary with time, which fails to capture the non-stationary components in many real-world scenarios. Many existing algorithms also assume knowledge of network conditions before decision, which rules out applications where unpredictability presents.
  Motivated by these issues, we consider Adversarial Network Optimization (ANO) under bandit feedback. Specifically, we consider the task of *i)* maximizing some unknown and time-varying utility function associated to scheduler's actions, where *ii)* the underlying network is a non-stationary multi-hop one whose conditions change arbitrarily with time, and *iii)* only bandit feedback (effect of actually deployed actions) is revealed after decisions. Our proposed `UMO2` algorithm ensures network stability and also matches the utility maximization performance of any "mildly varying" reference policy up to a polynomially decaying gap. To our knowledge, no previous ANO algorithm handled multi-hop networks or achieved utility guarantees under bandit feedback, whereas ours can do both.
  Technically, our method builds upon a novel integration of online learning into Lyapunov analyses: To handle complex inter-dependencies among queues in multi-hop networks, we propose meticulous techniques to balance online learning and Lyapunov arguments. To tackle the learning obstacles due to potentially unbounded queue sizes, we design a new online linear optimization algorithm that automatically adapts to loss magnitudes. To maximize utility, we propose a bandit convex optimization algorithm with novel queue-dependent learning rate scheduling that suites drastically varying queue lengths. Our new insights in online learning can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-agent Navigation with Lightweight DRL Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present an end-to-end collision avoidance policy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for multi-agent systems, demonstrating encouraging outcomes in real-world applications. In particular, our policy calculates the control commands of the agent based on the raw LiDAR observation. In addition, the number of parameters of the proposed basic model is 140,000, and the size of the parameter file is 3.5 MB, which allows the robot to calculate the actions from the CPU alone. We propose a multi-agent training platform based on a physics-based simulator to further bridge the gap between simulation and the real world. The policy is trained on a policy-gradients-based RL algorithm in a dense and messy training environment. A novel reward function is introduced to address the issue of agents choosing suboptimal actions in some common scenarios. Although the data used for training is exclusively from the simulation platform, the policy can be successfully transferred and deployed in real-world robots. Finally, our policy effectively responds to intentional obstructions and avoids collisions.

      <title>RoboMNIST: A Multimodal Dataset for Multi-Robot Activity Recognition Using WiFi Sensing, Video, and Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset for multi-robot activity recognition (MRAR) using two robotic arms integrating WiFi channel state information (CSI), video, and audio data. This multimodal dataset utilizes signals of opportunity, leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure to provide detailed indoor environmental sensing without additional sensor deployment. Data were collected using two Franka Emika robotic arms, complemented by three cameras, three WiFi sniffers to collect CSI, and three microphones capturing distinct yet complementary audio data streams. The combination of CSI, visual, and auditory data can enhance robustness and accuracy in MRAR. This comprehensive dataset enables a holistic understanding of robotic environments, facilitating advanced autonomous operations that mimic human-like perception and interaction. By repurposing ubiquitous WiFi signals for environmental sensing, this dataset offers significant potential aiming to advance robotic perception and autonomous systems. It provides a valuable resource for developing sophisticated decision-making and adaptive capabilities in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Predictive Control for the Treatment of Hyperthyroidism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an approach to determine the dosages of antithyroid agents to treat hyperthyroid patients. Instead of relying on a trial-and-error approach as it is commonly done in clinical practice, we suggest to determine the dosages by means of a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. To this end, we first extend a mathematical model of the pituitary-thyroid feedback loop such that the intake of methimazole, a common antithyroid agent, can be considered. Second, based on the extended model, we develop an MPC scheme to determine suitable dosages. In numerical simulations, we consider scenarios in which (i) patients are affected by Graves' disease and take the medication orally and (ii) patients suffering from a life-threatening thyrotoxicosis, in which the medication is usually given intravenously. Our conceptual study suggests that determining the medication dosages by means of an MPC scheme could be a promising alternative to the currently applied trial-and-error approach.</description>

      <title>Data-driven AC Optimal Power Flow with Physics-informed Learning and Calibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modern power grid is witnessing a shift in operations from traditional control methods to more advanced operational mechanisms. Due to the nonconvex nature of the Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem and the need for operations with better granularity in the modern smart grid, system operators require a more efficient and reliable ACOPF solver. While data-driven ACOPF methods excel in directly inferring the optimal solution based on power grid demand, achieving both feasibility and optimality remains a challenge due to the NP-hardness of the problem. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed machine learning model and a feasibility calibration algorithm to produce solutions for the ACOPF problem. Notably, the machine learning model produces solutions with a 0.5\% and 1.4\% optimality gap for IEEE bus 14 and 118 grids, respectively. The feasibility correction algorithm converges for all test scenarios on bus 14 and achieves a 92.2% convergence rate on bus 118.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and Optimizing the Time-Coupled Flexibilities at the Distribution-Level for TSO-DSO Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flexibilities provided by the distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution systems enable the coordination of transmission system operator (TSO) and distribution system operators (DSOs). At the distribution level, the flexibilities should be optimized for participation in the transmission system operation. This paper first proposes a flexibility quantification method that quantifies the costs of providing flexibilities and their values to the DSO in the TSO-DSO coordination. Compared with traditional power-range-based quantification approaches that are mainly suitable for generators, the proposed method can directly capture the time-coupling characteristics of DERs' individual and aggregated flexibility regions. Based on the quantification method, we further propose a DSO optimization model to activate the flexibilities from DER aggregators in the distribution system for energy arbitrage and ancillary services provision in the transmission system, along with a revenue allocation strategy that ensures a non-profit DSO. Numerical tests on the IEEE test system verify the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>CityLight: A Universal Model for Coordinated Traffic Signal Control in City-scale Heterogeneous Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasingly severe congestion problem in modern cities strengthens the significance of developing city-scale traffic signal control (TSC) methods for traffic efficiency enhancement. While reinforcement learning has been widely explored in TSC, most of them still target small-scale optimization and cannot directly scale to the city level due to unbearable resource demand. Only a few of them manage to tackle city-level optimization, namely a thousand-scale optimization, by incorporating parameter-sharing mechanisms, but hardly have they fully tackled the heterogeneity of intersections and intricate between-intersection interactions inherent in real-world city road networks. To fill in the gap, we target at the two important challenges in adopting parameter-sharing paradigms to solve TSC: inconsistency of inner state representations for intersections heterogeneous in configuration, scale, and orders of available traffic phases; intricacy of impacts from neighborhood intersections that have various relative traffic relationships due to inconsistent phase orders and diverse relative positioning. Our method, CityLight, features a universal representation module that not only aligns the state representations of intersections by reindexing their phases based on their semantics and designing heterogeneity-preserving observations, but also encodes the narrowed relative traffic relation types to project the neighborhood intersections onto a uniform relative traffic impact space. We further attentively fuse neighborhood representations based on their competing relations and incorporate neighborhood-integrated rewards to boost coordination. Extensive experiments with hundreds to tens of thousands of intersections validate the surprising effectiveness and generalizability of CityLight, with an overall performance gain of 11.68% and a 22.59% improvement in transfer scenarios in throughput.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies optimal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement to ensure line-of-sight (LOS) communication and sensing for a cluster of ground users possibly in deep shadow, while the UAV maintains backhaul connectivity with a base station (BS). The key challenges include unknown user locations, uncertain channel model parameters, and unavailable urban structure. Addressing these challenges, this paper focuses on developing an efficient online search strategy which jointly estimates channels, guides UAV positioning, and optimizes resource allocation. Analytically exploiting the geometric properties of the equipotential surface, this paper develops an LOS discovery trajectory on the equipotential surface while the closed-form search directions are determined using perturbation theory. Since the explicit expression of the equipotential surface is not available, this paper proposes to locally construct a channel model for each user in the LOS regime utilizing polynomial regression without depending on user locations or propagation distance. A class of spiral trajectories to simultaneously construct the LOS channels and search on the equipotential surface is developed. An optimal radius of the spiral and an optimal measurement pattern for channel gain estimation are derived to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the locally constructed channel. Numerical results on real 3D city maps demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves over 94% of the performance of a 3D exhaustive search scheme with just a 3-kilometer search.</description>

      <title>Convergence and sample complexity of natural policy gradient primal-dual methods for constrained MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02346</link>

Abstract: We study sequential decision making problems aimed at maximizing the expected total reward while satisfying a constraint on the expected total utility. We employ the natural policy gradient method to solve the discounted infinite-horizon optimal control problem for Constrained Markov Decision Processes (constrained MDPs). Specifically, we propose a new Natural Policy Gradient Primal-Dual (NPG-PD) method that updates the primal variable via natural policy gradient ascent and the dual variable via projected sub-gradient descent. Although the underlying maximization involves a nonconcave objective function and a nonconvex constraint set, under the softmax policy parametrization we prove that our method achieves global convergence with sublinear rates regarding both the optimality gap and the constraint violation. Such convergence is independent of the size of the state-action space, i.e., it is~dimension-free. Furthermore, for log-linear and general smooth policy parametrizations, we establish sublinear convergence rates up to a function approximation error caused by restricted policy parametrization. We also provide convergence and finite-sample complexity guarantees for two sample-based NPG-PD algorithms. Finally, we use computational experiments to showcase the merits and the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>UltimateKalman: Flexible Kalman Filtering and Smoothing Using Orthogonal Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: UltimateKalman is a flexible linear Kalman filter and smoother implemented in three popular programming languages: MATLAB, C, and Java. UltimateKalman is a slight simplification and slight generalization of an elegant Kalman filter and smoother that was proposed in 1977 by Paige and Saunders. Their algorithm appears to be numerically superior and more flexible than other Kalman filters and smoothers, but curiously has never been implemented or used before. UltimateKalman is flexible: it can easily handle time-dependent problems, problems with state vectors whose dimensions vary from step to step, problems with varying number of observations in different steps (or no observations at all in some steps), and problems in which the expectation of the initial state is unknown. The programming interface of UltimateKalman is broken into simple building blocks that can be used to construct filters, single or multi-step predictors, multi-step or whole-track smoothers, and combinations. The paper describes the algorithm and its implementation as well as with a test suite of examples and tests.</description>

      <title>Heat Death of Generative Models in Closed-Loop Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improvement and adoption of generative machine learning models is rapidly accelerating, as exemplified by the popularity of LLMs (Large Language Models) for text, and diffusion models for image generation. As generative models become widespread, data they generate is incorporated into shared content through the public web. This opens the question of what happens when data generated by a model is fed back to the model in subsequent training campaigns. This is a question about the stability of the training process, whether the distribution of publicly accessible content, which we refer to as "knowledge", remains stable or collapses.
  Small scale empirical experiments reported in the literature show that this closed-loop training process is prone to degenerating. Models may start producing gibberish data, or sample from only a small subset of the desired data distribution (a phenomenon referred to as mode collapse). So far there has been only limited theoretical understanding of this process, in part due to the complexity of the deep networks underlying these generative models.
  The aim of this paper is to provide insights into this process (that we refer to as "generative closed-loop learning") by studying the learning dynamics of generative models that are fed back their own produced content in addition to their original training dataset. The sampling of many of these models can be controlled via a "temperature" parameter. Using dynamical systems tools, we show that, unless a sufficient amount of external data is introduced at each iteration, any non-trivial temperature leads the model to asymptotically degenerate. In fact, either the generative distribution collapses to a small set of outputs or becomes uniform over a large set of outputs.</description>
