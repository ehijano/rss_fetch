      <title>Turing Instability Suppressed and Induced by Multiplicative Noise in Brusselator System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of multiplicative noise to the Turing instability of the Brusselator system is investigated. We show that when the noise acts on both of the concentrations with the same intensities, then the Turing instability is suppressed provided that the intensities are sufficiently large. This aligns with the stabilizing effect of multiplicative noise in partial differential equations. Utilizing the linearized system, we can quantify the magnitude of noise which stabilizes the system. On the other hand, when the noise is involving only one concentration, then the Turing instability can be triggered with suitable intensities. These are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Divergence-free drifts decrease concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that bounded divergence-free vector fields $u : [0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^d \to\mathbb{R}^d$ decrease the ''concentration'', quantified by the modulus of absolute continuity with respect to the Lebesgue measure, of solutions to the associated advection-diffusion equation when compared to solutions to the heat equation. In particular, for symmetric decreasing initial data, the solution to the advection-diffusion equation has (without a prefactor constant) larger variance, larger entropy, and smaller $L^p$ norms for all $p \in [1,\infty]$ than the solution to the heat equation. We also note that the same is not true on $\mathbb{T}^d$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of compressible vortex sheets in three-dimensional elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear stability of compressible vortex sheet solutions for three-dimensional (3D) isentropic elastic flows. Building upon previous results on the weakly linear stability of elastic vortex sheets [19], we perform a detailed study of the roots of the Lopatinskii determinant and identify a geometric stability condition associated with the deformation gradient. We employ an upper triangularization technique that isolates the outgoing modes into a closed system, where they appear only at the leading order. This enables us to derive energy estimates despite derivative loss. The major novelty of our approach includes the following two key aspects: (1) For the 3D compressible Euler vortex sheets, the front symbol exhibits degenerate ellipticity in certain frequency directions, which makes it challenging to ensure the front's regularity using standard energy estimates. Our analysis reveals that the non-parallel structure of the deformation gradient tensor plays a crucial role in recovering ellipticity in the front symbol, thereby enhancing the regularity of the free interface. (2) Another significant challenge in 3D arises from the strong degeneracy caused by the collision of repeated roots and poles. Unlike in 2D, where such interactions are absent, we encounter a co-dimension one set in frequency space where a double root coincides with a double pole. To resolve this, we refine Coulombel's diagonalization framework [21] and construct a suitable transformation that reduces the degeneracy order of the Lopatinskii matrix, enabling the use of localized Garding-type estimates to control the characteristic components. Finally, we employ a Nash-Moser iteration scheme to establish the local existence and nonlinear stability of vortex sheets under small initial perturbations, showing stability within a subsonic regime.</description>

      <title>Gradient continuity for the parabolic $(1,\,p)$-Laplace system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the parabolic $(1,\,p)$-Laplace system, a parabolic system that involves the one-Laplace and $p$-Laplace operators with $p\in(1,\,\infty)$. We aim to prove that a spatial gradient is continuous in space and time. An external force term is treated under the optimal regularity assumption in the parabolic Lebesgue spaces. We also discuss a generalized parabolic system with the Uhlenbeck structure. A main difficulty is that the uniform ellipticity of the $(1,\,p)$-Laplace operator is violated on a facet, or the degenerate region of a spatial gradient. The gradient continuity is proved by showing local H\"{o}lder continuity of a truncated gradient, whose support is far from the facet. This is rigorously demonstrated by considering approximate parabolic systems and deducing various regularity estimates for approximate solutions by classical methods such as De Giorgi's truncation, Moser's iteration, and freezing coefficient arguments. A weak maximum principle is also utilized when $p$ is not in the supercritical range.</description>

      <title>A note on the existence of self-similar profiles of the hydrodynamic formulation of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After performing the Madelung transformation, the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is transformed into a hydrodynamic equation akin to the compressible Euler equations with a certain dissipation. In this short note, we construct self-similar solutions of such system in the focusing case for any mass supercritical exponent. To the best of our knowledge these solutions are new, and may formally arise as potential blow-up profiles of the focusing NLS equation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stratification for the fractional Allen-Cahn equation and stationary nonlocal minimal surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of solutions to the fractional Allen-Cahn equation when $s\in (0, 1/2)$ and dimension $n\geq 2$. By applying the quantitative stratification principle developed by Naber and Valtorta, we obtain an optimal quantitative estimate on the transition set. As an application of this estimate, we improve the potential energy estimates of Cabre, Cinti, and Serra (2021), providing sharp versions for the fractional Allen-Cahn equation. Similarly, we obtain optimal perimeter estimates for stationary nonlocal minimal surfaces, extending previous results of Cinti, Serra, and Valdinoci (2019) from the stable case.</description>

      <title>A free boundary approach to the quasistatic evolution of debonding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical process of progressively debonding an adhesive membrane from a substrate is described as a quasistatic variational evolution of sets and herein investigated. Existence of energetic solutions, based on global minimisers of a suitable functional together with an energy balance, is obtained within the natural class of open sets, improving and simplifying previous results known in literature. The proposed approach relies on an equivalent reformulation of the model in terms of the celebrated one-phase Bernoulli free boundary problem. This point of view allows performing the Minimizing Movements scheme in spaces of functions instead of the more complicated framework of sets. Nevertheless, in order to encompass irreversibility of the phenomenon, it remains crucial to keep track of the debonded region at each discrete time-step, thus actually resulting in a coupled algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal control on a brain tumor growth model with lactate metabolism, viscoelastic effects, and tissue damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal control problem for a brain tumor growth model that incorporates lactate metabolism, viscoelastic effects, and tissue damage. The PDE system, introduced in [G. Cavalleri, P. Colli, A. Miranville, E. Rocca, On a Brain Tumor Growth Model with Lactate Metabolism, Viscoelastic Effects, and Tissue Damage (2025)], couples a Fisher-Kolmogorov type equation for tumor cell density with a reaction-diffusion equation for the lactate, a quasi-static force balance governing the displacement, and a nonlinear differential inclusion for tissue damage. The control variables, representing chemotherapy and a lactate-targeting drug, influence tumor progression and treatment response. Starting from well-posedness, regularity, and continuous dependence results already established, we define a suitable cost functional and prove the existence of optimal controls. Then, we analyze the differentiability of the control-to-state operator and establish a necessary first-order condition for treatment optimality.</description>

      <title>Formation of condensations for non-radial solutions to 3-wave kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider in this work a $2$-dimensional $3$-wave kinetic equation describing the dynamics of the thermal cloud outside a Bose-Einstein Condensate. We construct global non-radial mild solutions for the equation. Those mild solutions are the summation of Dirac masses on circles. We prove that in each spatial direction, either Dirac masses at the origin, which are the so-called Bose-Einstein condensates, can be formed in finite time or the solutions converge to Bose-Einstein condensates as time evolves to infinity. We also describe a dynamics of the formation of the Bose-Einstein condensates latter case. In this case, on each direction, the solutions accumulate around circles close to the origin at growth rates at least linearly in time.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for resolutions and smoothings of Calabi-Yau conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Calabi--Yau metrics with isolated conical singularities of Hein--Sun admit polyhomogeneous expansions near their singularities. Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi--Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi--Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi--Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose--type blow--ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi--Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow--up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi--Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi--Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.13355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the regularity of solutions to parabolic evolution equations. We consider semilinear problems on non-convex domains. Special attention is paid to the smoothness in the specific scale $B^r_{\tau,\tau}$, $\frac{1}{\tau}=\frac rd+ \frac 1p$ of Besov spaces. The regularity in these spaces determines the approximation order that can be achieved by adaptive and other nonlinear approximation schemes. We show that for all cases under consideration the Besov regularity is high enough to justify the use of adaptive algorithms. Our proofs are based on Schauder's fixed point theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of the resolvent at low energies has implications for many kinds of asymptotics, including for the scattering matrix and phase, for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, and for wave evolution. In this paper we present a robust method, based in part on resolvent identity arguments following Vodev and boundary pairing arguments following Melrose, for deriving such expansions, and implement it in detail for compactly supported perturbations of the Laplacian on $\mathbb R^2$. We obtain precise results for general self-adjoint black box perturbations, in the sense of Sj\"ostrand--Zworski, and also for some non-self-adjoint ones. The most important terms are the most singular ones, and we compute them in detail, relating them to spaces of zero eigenvalues and resonances.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev and Adams-Trudinger-Moser inequalities for symmetric functions without boundary conditions on hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding theorems for symmetric functions without zero boundary condition have been studied on flat Riemannian manifolds, such as the Euclidean space. However, these theorems have only been established on hyperbolic spaces for functions with zero boundary condition. In this work, we focus on sharp Sobolev and Adams-Trudinger-Moser embeddings for radial functions in hyperbolic spaces, considering both bounded and unbounded domains. One of the main features of our approach is that we do not assume boundary zero condition for symmetric functions on geodesic balls or the entire hyperbolic space. Our main results include Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, which establish weighted Sobolev embedding theorems, and Theorems 1.5 together with 1.6, which present Adams-Trudinger-Moser type of embedding theorems. In particular, a key result is Theorem 1.1 which is a highly nontrivial comparison result between norms of the higher order covariant derivatives and higher order derivatives of the radial functions. Higher order asymptotic behavior of radial functions on hyperbolic spaces are established to prove our main theorems. This approach includes novel radial lemmata and decay properties of higher order radial Sobolev functions defined in hyperbolic space.</description>

By passing through the mesoscopic and macroscopic limits with a fixed multiple-wise interaction of order $m$, we derive a macroscopic equation in the limit $m \rightarrow \infty$, capturing the dominant effects in large-size multiple-wise order.</description>

      <title>Flow approach on the monotonicity of shape functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a geometric flow framework to investigate the following two classical shape functionals: the torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian. First, by constructing novel deformation paths governed by stretching flows, we prove several new monotonicity properties of the torsional rigidity and the first eigenvalue along the evolutions restricted to triangles and rhombuses. These results also lead to new and simpler proofs of some known results, unifying and extending prior symmetrization-based proofs. Second, utilizing the mean curvature flow, we give a new proof of the Saint-Venant inequality for smooth convex bodies. This might represent the first flow-based proof to establish geometric functional inequalities that couple both the domain and the state function associated with it. Third, by discovering a gradient norm inequality for the sides of rectangles, we prove monotonicity and stronger rigidity results of the torsional rigidity on rectangles.</description>

      <title>Stochastic control on the half-line and applications to the optimal dividend/consumption problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:1703.07339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic control problem with the assumption that the system is controlled until the state process breaks the fixed barrier. Assuming some general conditions, it is proved that the resulting Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations has smooth solution. The aforementioned result is used to solve the optimal dividend and consumption problem. In the proof we use a fixed point type argument, with an operator which is based on the stochastic representation for a linear equation.</description>

      <title>Instability of nonlinear scalar field on strongly charged asymptotically AdS black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conformally invariant scalar equation permits the Robin boundary condition at infinity of asymptotically-AdS spacetimes. We show how the dynamics of conformal cubic scalar field on the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-anti-de Sitter background depend on the black hole size, charge, and choice of the boundary condition. We study the whole range of admissible charges, including the extremal case. In particular, we observe the transition in stability of the field for large black holes at the specific critical value of the charge. Similarities between Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr black hole let us suspect that a similar effect may also occur in rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>A novel necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of $2\times 2$ first-order linear hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a necessary and sufficient stability condition for a class of two coupled first-order linear hyperbolic partial differential equations. Through a backstepping transform, the problem is reformulated as a stability problem for an integral difference equation, that is, a difference equation with distributed delay. Building upon a St\'ep\'an--Hassard argument variation theorem originally designed for time-delay systems of retarded type, we then introduce a theorem that counts the number of unstable roots of our integral difference equation. This leads to the expected necessary and sufficient stability criterion for the system of first-order linear hyperbolic partial differential equations. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations.</description>

      <title>Shape Taylor expansion for wave scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taylor expansion of wave fields with respect to shape parameters has a wide range of applications in wave scattering problems, including inverse scattering, optimal design, and uncertainty quantification. However, deriving the high order shape derivatives required for this expansion poses significant challenges with conventional methods. This paper addresses these difficulties by introducing elegant recurrence formulas for computing high order shape derivatives. The derivation employs tools from exterior differential forms, Lie derivatives, and material derivatives. The work establishes a unified framework for computing the high order shape perturbations in scattering problems. In particular, the recurrence formulas are applicable to both acoustic and electromagnetic scattering models under a variety of boundary conditions, including Dirichlet, Neumann, impedance, and transmission types.</description>

      <title>An isopermetric inequality for lower order Neumann eigenvalues in Gauss space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a sharp isoperimetric inequality for the harmonic mean of the first $m-1$ nonzero Neumann eigenvalues for bounded Lipschitz domains symmetric about the origin in Gauss space. Our result generalizes the Szeg\"o-Weinberger type inequality in Gauss space, as proved in [8, Theorem 4.1].</description>
