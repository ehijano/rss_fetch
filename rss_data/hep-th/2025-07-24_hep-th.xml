      <title>Instabilities in scale-separated Casimir vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric scale separation is notoriously difficult to achieve in flux compactifications of gravitational effective theories. An appealing alternative to conventional Freund-Rubin vacua involves Ricci-flat internal manifolds, where the energy supplied by fluxes is balanced not by curvature but by the Casimir energy. The internal volume can be stabilized by this mechanism producing anti-de Sitter geometries with parametric scale separation, including an explicit example in eleven-dimensional supergravity. We study deformations of these geometries, showing the presence of perturbative and non-perturbative instabilities.</description>

      <title>Interpolating between Space-like and Time-like Entanglement via Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entanglement entropy for slab like regions in quantum field theories, using their holographic duals. We focus on the transition between space like and time like separations. By considering boosted subsystems in conformal and confining holographic backgrounds, we identify two classes of extremal surfaces: real ones (Type I) and complex surfaces (Type II). These interpolate between the usual Ryu Takayanagi prescription and its time like generalisations. We derive explicit expressions for the entanglement entropy in both conformal and confining cases. We discuss their behaviour across phase transitions and null limits. The interpolation between Type I and Type II surfaces reveals an analytic continuation of the extremal surface across the light cone. Our analysis also finds the existence of a Ryu Takayanagi surface (Type I) even for time like separations in the confining field theory case.</description>

      <title>Medicine show: A Calogero model with principal series states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Calogero model is an interacting, $N$-particle, $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$-invariant quantum mechanics, whose Hilbert space is furnished by a tower of discrete series modules. The system enjoys both classical and quantum integrability at any $N$ and at any value of the coupling; this is guaranteed by the existence of $N$ mutually-commuting currents, one of them being the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we alter the Calogero model so that it may accommodate states in the unitary principal series irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$. Doing so requires changing the domain of the quantum operators--a procedure which succeeds in preserving unitarity and $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$-invariance, but breaks the integrability of the theory. We explicitly solve the deformed model for $N=2,3$ and outline a procedure for solving the model at general $N$. We expect this deformed model to provide us with general lessons that carry over to other systems with states in the principal series, for example, interacting massive quantum field theories on de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Massive deformations of supersymmetric Yang-Mills matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically classify all supersymmetry-preserving mass deformations of SYM matrix models in all dimensions (D = 3, 4, 6, 10). In D = 10 the polarized IKKT model emerges as the only possible deformation. Moreover, in the particular case D = 4 we identify two massive, sign-problem-free models, making them attractive candidates for non-perturbative numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Analytic Regression of Feynman Integrals from High-Precision Numerical Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematics or theoretical physics one is often interested in obtaining an exact analytic description of some data which can be produced, in principle, to arbitrary accuracy. For example, one might like to know the exact analytical form of a definite integral. Such problems are not well-suited to numerical symbolic regression, since typical numerical methods lead only to approximations. However, if one has some sense of the function space in which the analytic result should lie, it is possible to deduce the exact answer by judiciously sampling the data at a sufficient number of points with sufficient precision. We demonstrate how this can be done for the computation of Feynman integrals. We show that by combining high-precision numerical integration with analytic knowledge of the function space one can often deduce the exact answer using lattice reduction. A number of examples are given as well as an exploration of the trade-offs between number of datapoints, number of functional predicates, precision of the data, and compute. This method provides a bottom-up approach that neatly complements the top-down Landau-bootstrap approach of trying to constrain the exact answer using the analytic structure alone. Although we focus on the application to Feynman integrals, the techniques presented here are more general and could apply to a wide range of problems where an exact answer is needed and the function space is sufficiently well understood.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement from Holographic Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several notions of entanglement in time have emerged as a novel frontier in quantum many-body physics, quantum field theory and gravity. We propose a systematic prescription to characterize temporal entanglement in relativistic quantum field theory in a general state for an arbitrary subregion on a flat, constant-time slice in a flat spacetime. Our prescriptions starts with the standard entanglement entropy of a spatial subregion and amounts to transporting the unchanged subregion to boosted time slices all the way across the light cone when it becomes in general a complex characterization of the corresponding temporal subregion. For holographic quantum field theories, our prescription amounts to an analytic continuation of all codimension-two bulk extremal surfaces satisfying the homology constraint and picking the one with the smallest real value of the area as the leading saddle point. We implement this prescription for the holographic conformal field theories in thermal states on both a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and three-dimensional Minkowski space, and show that it leads to results with self-consistent physical properties of temporal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Page Curve for an Evaporating Schwarzschild Black Hole in Dimensionally-Reduced Model of Dilaton Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entanglement entropy of quantum fields in a (1+1)-dimensional model of dilaton gravity derived from the four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action by dimensional reduction. Scalar matter is coupled to gravity, while the back-reaction is included via the Polyakov-Liouville action. This theory exhibits both eternal and evaporating Schwarzschild black hole solutions. The fine-grained entropy in a collapse scenario is investigated by applying the "island rule" via the quantum extremal surface approach. We demonstrate that the fine-grained entropy of the Hawking radiation follows the Page curve, and therefore the evolution of the Hawking radiation is unitary.</description>

      <title>On Supersymmetric D-brane probes in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $\text{AdS}_2\times\mathbf{S}^2$ Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the $\kappa$-symmetry analysis of supersymmetric D-brane probes in the $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathbf{S}^2$ attractor geometry, originally performed by Simons, Strominger, Thompson, and Yin, to also include stationary -- but non-static -- worldlines carrying angular momentum along the 2-sphere. We demonstrate that certain special trajectories, with fixed radius and orbital velocity, solve the equations of motion and moreover satisfy a supersymmetry preserving condition, thus defining new $\frac12$-BPS configurations. Furthermore, these classical paths are shown to saturate a lower bound for the Hamiltonian generating global time translations, with the corresponding minimal energy depending on a generalized angular momentum vector $\boldsymbol{J}$. The direction of the latter, in turn, determines exactly which supercharges remain unbroken. Our results reveal a richer spectrum of (multi-particle) supersymmetric states in $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathbf{S}^2$, which can be organized into distinct selection sectors labeled by the conserved $SU(2)$ charges. This construction has direct applications in black hole microstate counting, the analysis of probe dynamics and $\text{AdS}_2/\text{CFT}_1$ holography.</description>

      <title>Matter Spectral Functions from Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Lorentzian quantum gravity coupled to a template matter sector with gauge fields, scalars and fermions. In the absence of quantised gravity, the matter sector by itself is renormalisable, but UV-incomplete. Provided quantum gravity offers an asymptotically safe UV-completion, we determine the photon and scalar two-point functions in the presence of gravitational fluctuations, and show that both possess a K\"all\'en-Lehmann spectral representation. Our results are achieved using functional renormalisation adapted for theories in Lorentzian signature. We explain why and how interactions with gravity modify both the infrared as well as the ultraviolet behaviour of matter spectral functions. We further determine the corresponding form factors on the level of the quantum effective action. Limitations and extensions of our study are discussed alongside implications for particle physics and unitarity of quantum gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>JT gravity and deformed CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose alternative \textit{UV completion} of pure JT gravity as well as CFT coupled to JT gravity, via a class of \textit{deformed} 2D CFT. In AdS/CFT with a prescribed classical limit, pure JT gravity in \textit{one-sided} AdS$_{2}$ black hole is argued to be described by certain holographic deformed CFT on a strip. Equivalently, these deformed CFTs can be recast as CFTs on one-sided AdS$_{2}$ black hole with \textit{emergent conformal boundary condition on a stretched horizon}$-$providing a \textit{proper UV frame} of JT gravity. On the other hand, JT gravity coupled to CFT with fixed central charge of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, is also described by deformed CFT on strip satisfying conformal boundary condition, with a different classical limit. The resulting CFT Hilbert spaces in both of the above classical limits yield the black hole entropy as thermal entropy and the high-energy density of states match that of JT gravity with a precise energy scale correspondence. Moreover, the Hilbert space defined for a two-sided black hole factorizes into two one-sided sectors in both limits. Notably in the second limit, degenerate zero modes of the deformed Hamiltonian$-$characterized by conformal primaries localized at the horizon$-$appear as a residual effect of the stretched horizon boundary condition. Exploiting the second limit, we compute entanglement entropy in one-dimensional quantum systems dual to a conformally glued black hole$-$Poincar\'e geometry in JT gravity, reproducing a `Page curve' via the quantum extremal surface prescription, with `Page time' set by the stretched horizon cutoff.</description>

      <title>Entanglement islands and black hole decay in regular dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of two-dimensional dilaton gravity models with linear dilaton vacuum including Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model as the special case. General thermodynamic properties of black holes in such models are evaluated. We focus on the CGHS model and its modification with regular black holes as empty-space solutions characterized by ever-present finite curvature. We find generalized entanglement entropy blows-up for near-extremal regular black holes considered as remnants. That signalling a possible breakdown of the semiclassical approximation near the endpoint of evaporation. We conjecture that remnants are unstable and decay by quantum fluctuations into horizonless spacetimes. We give an estimate for the decay amplitude by using a semiclassical regularization method and propose a path to mitigate the unitarity loss problem.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relation on rotating charged black strings with arbitrary cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Goon-Penco (GP) relation was investigated on rotating charged black strings with an arbitrary cosmological constant. It has been demonstrated that the GP relation retains its form in the context of spacetimes described by cylindrical coordinates. In addition, the GP relation is derived in scenarios where the energy state parameters (including angular momentum $J$ and charge $Q$, etc.) are expressed as functions of the perturbation parameter $\eta$. This finding indicates that the GP relation is not only valid for spacetimes described by spherically symmetric coordinates, but also prevalent for non-spherically symmetric spacetimes, such as cylindrical coordinates. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that the GP relation is universal for spacetimes with arbitrary cosmological constants, irrespective of the adopted coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Two coupled chiral SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral SYK model is an 1 + 1 dimensional generalisation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with chiral Majorana fermions. The Dyson-Schwinger equation of the model is exactly solvable in the large-N limit, leading to an exact analytic solution of the two-point function valid across all energy scales. We consider two chiral SYK systems coupled by a quadratic interaction that explicitly breaks the scaling and time reversal symmetry. We compute the two-point function analytically by solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations perturbatively when the two systems are weakly coupled. We find that the system does not acquire a mass gap unlike the 0+1 dimensional coupled SYK model. The leading correction to thermal free energy is independent of temperature and the ground state entropy remains the same as the entropy of 2N free chiral Majorana fermions. The coupled model can be realised as a gapless edge theory of 2+1 dimensional gapped topological condensed matter systems that do not preserve scaling and time reversal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $\kappa$-deformed theory of a spin-1/2 field. We construct an action that is Poincar\'e invariant and analyze its consequences within the deformed framework. Our results confirm the findings of our recent analysis of the $\kappa$-deformed scalar field, where we established that there is no action invariant under both Poincar\'e symmetry and charge conjugation in the $\kappa$-deformed case. Furthermore, we present an explicit calculation of the Noether charges associated with Poincar\'e symmetry and show that their algebra closes, demonstrating the internal consistency of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamical connection between the surface growth scheme and the conformal field theory with $T\bar{T}$ deformation. By utilizing the extended one-shot entanglement distillation tensor network, we find that the iterative growth, i.e. radial evolution of homogenous and isotropic bulk minimal surfaces in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime can be mapped to the $T\bar{T}$ operator flow driven by the deformation parameter. Our results show that the $T\bar{T}$ deformation can provide a dynamical mechanism for the surface growth in asymptotically AdS spacetime, which may shed light on reconstructing bulk gravitational dynamics from the surface growth scheme.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IKKT matrix model has been investigated as a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. One of the recent developments concerning this model is the discovery of the dual supergravity solution corresponding to the model obtained after supersymmetry-preserving mass deformation, which is dubbed the polarized IKKT model. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of this model in the case of matrix size N = 2 for a wide range of the deformation parameter Omega. While we reproduce precisely the known result for the partition function obtained by the localization method developed for supersymmetric theories, we also calculate the observables, which were not accessible by previous work, in order to probe the spacetime structure emergent from the dominant matrix configurations. In particular, we find that the saddle point corresponding to the original IKKT model is smoothly connected to the saddle represented by the fuzzy sphere dominant at large Omega, whereas the dominant configurations become diverging commuting matrices at small Omega.</description>

      <title>Continuous spin superparticle in $4D$, ${\cal N}=1$ curved superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new particle model that describes the dynamics of a $4D,$ $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ continuous spin particle in $AdS_4$ superspace and is a generalization of the continuous-spin superparticle model in flat $4D$, $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ superspace proposed in 2506.19709 [hep-th]. The model is described by $4D$, $\mathcal{N}{=}\,1$ superspace coordinates together with commuting spinor additional variables, which are inherent ingredients of continuous spin models. The Lagrangian and the system of four bosonic and four fermionic phase space constraints are derived. The consistency condition for constraints imposes a restriction on supergeometry to be $AdS$ superpace. It is shown that the bosonic constraints are first-class constraints. A covariant procedure based on the use of additional variables is developed to divide the four fermionic constraints into first and second classes. It is proved that, unlike the flat case, only one fermionic constraint is a first-class constraint, while the other three are second-class constraints. In the flat limit, one of these second-class constraints becomes a first-class one.</description>

      <title>Open strings in type IIB AdS$_3$ flux vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of open strings is investigated in the context of AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua arising from type IIB orientifold reductions. On the one hand, contrary to expectations, the perturbative stability of certain recently found non-supersymmetric AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua is shown to be robust under fluctuations of the open-string moduli. On the other hand, a wealth of new perturbatively stable AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua appears as a consequence of the non-trivial dynamics of open-string moduli. We also comment on the issue of scale separation in these AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry and integrability of the elliptic $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{T}^4$ superstring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a 1-parameter family of Ramond-Ramond fluxes supporting the elliptic $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{T}^4$ metric with constant dilaton and preserving 8 of the 16 supercharges of the undeformed background. On the supersymmetric locus, we compute the tree-level worldsheet S-matrix in uniform light-cone gauge up to quadratic order in fermions and find that it non-trivially satisfies the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, imposing classical integrability and symmetries, we conjecture compatible processes quartic in fermions. We also investigate different limits of interest, including trigonometric deformations and the limit to the $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2 \times \mathrm{T}^6$ superstring. Our results provide strong evidence for a supersymmetric and integrable elliptic deformation of the $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{T}^4$ superstring supported by Ramond-Ramond flux and a constant dilaton.</description>

      <title>Graviton scattering on self-dual black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of gravitational wave scattering on black hole spacetimes is an extremely hard problem, typically requiring approximation schemes which either treat the black hole perturbatively or are only amenable to numerical techniques. In this paper, we consider linearised gravitational waves (or gravitons) scattering on the self-dual analogue of a black hole: namely, the self-dual Taub-NUT metric. Using the hidden integrability of the self-dual sector, we can solve the linearised Einstein equations on these self-dual black hole backgrounds exactly in terms of simple, explicit quasi-momentum eigenstates. Using a description of the self-dual Taub-NUT metric and its gravitons in terms of twistor theory, we obtain an explicit formula, exact in the background, for the tree-level maximal helicity violating graviton scattering amplitude at arbitrary multiplicity, with and without spin. This is obtained from the description of the MHV amplitudes in terms of the perturbation theory of a chiral sigma model whose target is the twistor space of the background. The incorporation of spin effects on these backgrounds is a straightforward application of the Newman-Janis shift. We also demonstrate that the holomorphic collinear splitting functions in the self-dual background are equal to those in flat space so that the celestial symmetry algebra is undeformed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an angular dipole deformation of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) that preserves its classical scale invariance. We show that two-point functions of suitable single trace operators, restricted to an invariant plane, are determined by scaling dimensions computable from an integrable spin chain. This spin chain is a diagonally twisted version of the famous integrable spin chain of SYM. It matches expectations from the dual string theory perfectly, presenting a precision test of holography in this new setting, and an important step to understanding general twisted integrable AdS/CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the intriguing interplay between topology and quantum criticality has been unveiled in one-dimensional topological chains with extended nearest-neighbor couplings. In these systems, topologically distinct critical phases emerge with localized edge modes despite the vanishing bulk gap. In this work, we study the topological multicritical points at which distinct gapped and critical phases intersect. Specifically, we consider a topological chain with coupling up to the third nearest neighbors, which shows stable localized edge modes at the multicritical points. These points possess only nontrivial gapped and critical phases around them and are also characterized by the quadratic dispersion around the gap-closing points. We characterize the topological multicritical points in terms of the topological invariant obtained from the zeros of the complex function associated with the Hamiltonian. Further, we analyze the nature of zeros in the vicinity of the multicritical points by calculating the discriminants of the associated polynomial. The discriminant uniquely identifies the topological multicritical points and distinguishes them from the trivial ones. We finally study the robustness of the zero-energy modes at the multicritical points at weak disorder strengths, and reveal the presence of a topologically nontrivial gapless Anderson-localized phase at strong disorder strengths.</description>

      <title>Exterior Cyclic Polytopes and Convexity of Amplituhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplituhedron is a semialgebraic set in the Grassmannian. We study convexity and duality of amplituhedra. We introduce a notion of convexity, called \textit{extendable convexity}, for real semialgebraic sets in any embedded projective variety. We show that the $k=m=2$ amplituhedron is extendably convex in the Grassmannian of lines in projective three-space. In the process we introduce a new polytope called the \emph{exterior cyclic polytope}, generalizing the cyclic polytope. It is equal to the convex hull of the amplituhedron in the Pl\"ucker embedding. We undertake a combinatorial analysis of the exterior cyclic polytope, its facets, and its dual. Finally, we introduce the \textit{(extendable) dual amplituhedron}, which is closely related to the dual of the exterior cyclic polytope. We show that the dual amplituhedron for $k=m=2$ is again an amplituhedron, where the external matrix data is changed by the twist map.</description>

      <title>Effective Pressure of the FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by $P_{eff}:=-dE/dV$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$, and in this case, the effective pressure is not always negative and has a minimum. The effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new bounds on black hole entropy in terms of the specific heat at fixed charges. For special spherically-symmetric and static black holes ($g_{tt} g_{rr}=-1$), we prove the bounds with suitable sufficient energy conditions. For more general static and rotating black holes, we test the bounds with a variety of examples. This work extends the previously-known algebraic inequalities of the black hole thermodynamic variables such as the Penrose inequality, to include their derivatives.</description>

      <title>Identifying Coleman-Weinberg type-chiral phase transition in QCD-like scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral phase transition in QCD-like theories can be Coleman-Weinberg type supercooling. This is possible to see when Beyond the Standard Model (say, axionlike particle or baryogenesis) is coupled to QCD of the Standard Model (called ordinary QCD). Identifying such a supecooling chiral phase transition thus opens a new window to search for new physics associated with the QCD phase transition epoch of the thermal history, to be probed by gravitational wave and primordial black hole productions. We discuss this possibility by monitoring ordinary QCD setup in a view of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in hot and/or dense medium, at the mean-field approximation level. We find that the identification essentially follows the scale violation classification: soft-scale breaking and quantum scale anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic and anomalous Hall conductivities induce anomalous transport features and novel optical phenomena in chiral systems. Here, we investigate reflection properties on the surface of a medium ruled by axion electrodynamics, which effectively describes optical aspects of Weyl semimetals. We show that these chiral media can manifest anomalous reflectance (R greater than unity) for some frequency windows, depending on the signs of the two involved conductivities. Such a reflectance can increase with the frequency, being always greater than 1 in certain frequency bands. We also examine the complex Kerr angles at normal incidence on the chiral medium. Giant Kerr angle is observed within the absorption window, while the Kerr ellipticity may be used to determine the relative sign of the magnetic conductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconvergence relations for structure functions emerging at the Siegert point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Burkhardt--Cottingham sum rule is an exact superconvergence relation for a spin-structure function, derived from general principles of light absorption and scattering, and valid at any momentum transfer $Q^2$. I illustrate how a class of such relations emerges from the Siegert point, an unphysical kinematical point where both the probe and the target are at rest. From light-by-light scattering, a new sum rule for $\gamma^\ast \gamma^\ast$ fusion is emerging , valid for arbitrary photon virtualities. When one of the photons becomes real, this sum rule reproduces the known relations for the photon spin-structure functions. Regarding the convergence of these relations, I present a simple argument for the suppression of longitudinal photon polarizations at high energy. Among its consequences is the prediction of $\sigma_L/ \sigma_T \to 0$ at high energy, for the ratio of unpolarized nucleon photoabsorption cross sections.</description>

      <title>Quark and lepton mixing in the asymptotically safe Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quark mixing (CKM) matrix is near-diagonal, whereas the lepton mixing (PMNS) matrix is not. We learn that both observations can generically be explained within an ultraviolet completion of the Standard Model with gravity. We find that certain relations between CKM matrix elements should hold approximately because of asymptotically safe regimes, including $|V_{ud}|^2+|V_{us}|^2 \approx 1$ and $|V_{cd}|^2+|V_{cs}|^2\approx 1$. Theoretically, the accuracies of these relations determine the length of the asymptotically safe regimes. Experimental data confirms these relations with an accuracy of $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively. This difference in accuracies is also expected, because the ultraviolet completion consists in a fixed-point cascade during which one relation is established already much deeper in the ultraviolet. This results in $|V_{ub}|^2 &lt; |V_{cb}|^2$ and translates into measurable properties of $B$-mesons.
  Similar results would hold for the PMNS matrix, if neutrino Yukawa couplings were large. The ultraviolet complete theory therefore must -- and in fact can -- avoid such an outcome. It contains a mechanism that dynamically limits the size of neutrino Yukawa couplings. Below an upper bound on the sum of Dirac neutrino masses, this allows the PMNS matrix to avoid a near-diagonal structure like the CKM matrix. Thus, large neutrino mixing is intimately tied to small Dirac neutrino masses, $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim {\mathcal{O}} (1)\, \rm eV$ and a mass gap in the Standard Model fermion masses.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics of Spherically Symmetric Static Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, the Einstein equations provide spherically symmetric static spacetimes with dynamics defined as an evolution along the radial coordinate $r$. The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical system, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate variables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or quantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general relativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to non-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism through various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians describing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with linear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians that reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to renormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the singularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free black-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning from a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside Schwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both semi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure of self-gravitating compact objects and black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring potential empirical manifestations of quantum gravity is a challenging pursuit. In this study, we utilise a lattice representation of a (2+1)D massive gravity toy model interacting with Dirac fermions that can support specific spacetime fluctuations. We focus on the evolution of the fermion's spin due to its coupling to spacetime fluctuations. To monitor their dynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes describing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the fermion. A possible emulation of this system involves encoding spin degrees of freedom in an atom coupled with a bimodal optical cavity that provides the two bosonic modes. We observe diverse spin evolution patterns based on its interaction with fluctuating spacetime geometry. Our proposal introduces a novel approach for modelling the effect of interactions between quantum gravity and matter that can be probed with current technology.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Phase and Parity in the Hamiltonian Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions to the strong CP problem based on P or CP symmetries are typically framed using the Lagrangian formalism. In this work, we analyze the strong CP phase in QCD from the Hamiltonian perspective, focusing on the invariance of the Hamiltonian H under P (or a generalized parity operator $\mathcal{P}$). For $\mathcal{P}$ to be a physical symmetry, it must preserve the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\theta$ associated with the $\theta$-vacuum (i.e., $\mathcal{P}: \mathcal{H}_\theta \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_\theta$). This requirement implies that the strong CP phase $\bar{\theta} = \theta + \arg \det M$ must vanish, i.e., $\theta$ must cancel the phase of the quark mass matrix $M$. Equivalently, we show that this condition follows from requiring that parity commute with the large gauge transformation operator of QCD.</description>

      <title>New constrained generalized Killing spinor field classes in warped flux compactifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Fierz identities are addressed in the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle framework from the perspective of the equations governing constrained generalized Killing spinor fields. We explore the spin geometry in a Riemannian 8-manifold composing a warped flux compactification AdS$_3\times M_8$, whose metric and fluxes preserve one supersymmetry in AdS$_3$. Supersymmetry conditions can be efficiently translated into spinor bilinear covariants, whose algebraic and differential constraints yield identifying new spinor field classes. Intriguing implications and potential applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in an evaporating black hole through non-isometric map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The black hole information paradox has been an important problem in quantum gravity. In the study of evaporating black hole, it has been proposed that the holographic map between the semi-classical effective description in bulk and the fundamental description in boundary cannot be isometric. In this work, we would like to study the reflected entropy in an evaporating black hole model through non-isometric holographic map. We assume that the evaporating is slowly enough that it makes sense to ascribe a slowly varying temperature to the Hawking radiation. We then introduce a two-sided black hole model to canonically purify the semi-classical state. The holographic map to the fundamental description is non-isometric and defined by a Haar random unitary matrix. We show that the entanglement entropy of the radiation in the model matches the result read from the quantum extremal surface formula and agrees with the Page curve. Furthermore, we study the reflected entropies between different regions, including the one between the black holes on different sides, the one between the radiations distributed symmetrically but disconnectedly, and the one between the black hole and the radiation on single side. Our results are consistent with the existing ones based on the effective descriptions.</description>

      <title>Scalar weak gravity bound from full unitarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak gravity conjecture can be formulated as a statement that gravity must be the weakest force, compared to the other interactions in low energy effective field theory (EFT). Several arguments in favor of this statement were presented from the side of string theory and black hole physics. However, it is still an open question whether the statement of weak gravity can be proven based on more general assumptions of causality, unitarity, and locality of the fundamental theory. These consistency requirements imply the dispersion relations for the scattering amplitudes which allow to bound the EFT coefficients. The main difficulty for obtaining these constraints in the presence of gravity is related to the graviton pole which makes the required dispersion relations divergent in the forward limit. In this work, we present a new way of deriving the bound on the ratio between the EFT cutoff scale and Planck mass from confronting the IR divergences from graviton pole and one-loop running of the EFT Wilson coefficient in front of the dimension-12 operator. Our method also allows the incorporation of full unitarity of partial wave expansion of the UV theory. We examine the EFT of a single shift-symmetric scalar in four dimensions and find that the maximal value of the cutoff scale of the EFT coupled to gravity must be lower than about $O(10)$ Planck mass.</description>

      <title>On non-planar ABJM anomalous dimensions from M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times S^{7}/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar parts of conformal dimensions of primary operators in $U_k(N) \times U_{-k}(N)$ ABJM theory are controlled by integrability. Strong coupling asymptotics of planar dimensions of operators with large spins can be found from the energy of semiclassical strings in AdS$_{4}\times$CP$^3$ but computing non-planar corrections requires understanding higher genus string corrections. As was pointed out in arXiv:2408.10070, there is an alternative way to find the non-planar corrections by quantizing M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ which are wrapped around the 11d circle of radius $1/k= \lambda/N$ and generalize spinning strings in AdS$_4\times$CP$^3$. Computing the 1-loop correction to the energy of M2 brane that corresponds to the long folded string with large spin $S$ in AdS$_4$ allowed to obtain a prediction for the large $\lambda$ limit of non-planar corrections to the cusp anomalous dimension. Similar predictions were found for non-planar dimensions of operators dual to M2 branes that generalize the ''short'' and ''long'' circular strings with two equal spins $J_1=J_2$ in CP$^3$. Here we consider two more non-trivial examples of 1-loop M2 brane computations that correspond to: (i) long folded string with large spin $S$ in AdS$_4$ and orbital momentum $J$ in CP$^3$ whose energy determines the generalized cusp anomalous dimension, and (ii) circular string with spin $S$ in AdS$_4$ and spin $J$ in CP$^3$. We find the leading terms of the expansion of the corresponding 1-loop M2 brane energies in $1/k$. We also discuss similar semiclassical 1-loop M2 brane computation in flat 11d background and comment on possible relation to higher genus corrections to energies in 10d string theory.</description>

      <title>The Sky Remembers everything: Celestial amplitude, Shadow and OPE in quadratic EFT of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the celestial amplitude arising from higher curvature corrections to Einstein gravity, incorporating phase dressing. The inclusion of such corrections leads to effective modifications of the theory's ultraviolet (UV) behaviour. In the eikonal limit, we find that, in contrast to Einstein's gravity, where the $u$ and $s$-channel contributions cancel, these contributions remain non-vanishing in the presence of higher curvature terms. We examine the analytic structure of the resulting amplitude and derive a dispersion relation for the phase-dressed eikonal amplitude in quadratic gravity. Furthermore, we investigate the celestial conformal block expansion of the Mellin-transformed conformal shadow amplitude within the framework of celestial conformal field theory (CCFT). As a consequence, we compute the corresponding operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients using the Burchnall-Chaundy expansion. In addition, we evaluate the OPE via the Euclidean OPE inversion formula across various kinematic channels and comment on its applicability and implications. Finally, we briefly explore the Carrollian amplitude associated with the corresponding quadratic EFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies of linearized stability of asymptotically flat Euclidean axion wormholes found that symmetric modes suffered from divergences. We show that such divergences were an artifact of a particular way of solving the constraints, and that a full treatment leads to finite actions for such modes. The modes must thus be included in a stability analysis. However, since the action for these modes turns out to be positive, this turns out not to affect previous statements about stability of axion wormholes. We also introduce a technique that allows us to show this positivity at a pseudo-analytic level that avoids heavy numerics. Our techniques should be useful to future studies of stabilities of other wormholes as well.</description>

      <title>Quantum querying based on multicontrolled Toffoli gates for causal Feynman loop configurations and directed acyclic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are a promising framework for unfolding the causal configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams, which is equivalent to querying the \textit{directed acyclic graph} (DAG) configurations of undirected graphs in graph theory. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for querying in both types of applications, using a systematic and sparing logic in the design of an oracle operator. The construction of the quantum oracle is based exclusively on multicontrolled Toffoli (MCX) gates and quantum NOT (Pauli-$X$) gates. The efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated by comparison with a quantum algorithm based on binary clauses. Furthermore, we analyse the impact of traspilation and introduce an appropriate metric to assess the complexity of the algorithm, the \emph{quantum circuit area}. We explicitly analyse three-, four- and five-eloop topologies, which have not previously been explored due to their higher complexity and the current limitations of quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: The identification of physical subsystems in quantum mechanics as compared to classical mechanics poses significant conceptual challenges, especially in the context of quantum gravity. Traditional approaches associate quantum systems with classical ones localized in spacetime, using either Hilbert space factors for finite-dimensional systems or local operator algebras in algebraic quantum field theory. These methods ensure statistical independence for state preparations and measurements. However, covariant linearized quantum gravity disrupts this framework by preventing the formation of gauge-invariant local algebras, thereby undermining statistical independence. This presents a major obstacle for modeling early universe cosmology and gravity-induced entanglement experiments, and poses a significant roadblock toward a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity. A pivotal shift is proposed: the identification between classical and quantum systems should be dynamically evolving rather than fixed, opening the possibility of a single-world unitary quantum mechanics. This perspective aligns with the broader aim of understanding how classical spatiotemporal existence emerges from quantum mechanics and connects the measurement problem with quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) anisotropies contain valuable information about the physics of the early universe. Given that General Relativity is intrinsically nonlinear, it is important to look beyond first-order contributions in cosmological perturbations. In this work, we present a non-perturbative approach for the computation of CGWB anisotropies at large scales, providing the extension of the initial conditions and the Sachs-Wolfe effect for the CGWB, which encodes the full non-linearity of the scalar metric perturbations. We also derive the non-perturbative expression for three-point correlation of the gravitational wave energy density perturbation in the case of an inflationary CGWB with a scale-invariant power spectrum and negligible primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that, under such conditions, the gravitational wave energy density perturbations are lognormally distributed, leading to an interesting effect such as intermittency.</description>

Abstract: We derive formulae that resum, at a given order in the soft limit, the infinite series of Post-Minkowskian (small gravitational coupling) or Post-Newtonian (small velocities) corrections to the gravitational waveform produced by particles moving along a general (open or closed) trajectory in the Schwarzschild geometry in the probe limit. Specifying to the case of circular orbits, we compute the waveform and the energy flux to order 30PN, and compare it against the available results in the literature. Our results are based on a novel hypergeometric representation of the solutions of the Heun equation (and its confluence), that leads to a simple mathematical proof of the Heun connection formula.</description>

      <title>Signatures of asymmetry: Gravitational wave memory and the parity violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's equivalence principle suggests a deep connection between matter and spacetime, prompting the question: if matter violates parity, must gravity? This letter explores the detection of parity violation in gravity using gravitational wave (GW) memory. Gravitational parity violation could be observable through GW amplitude birefringence and large-scale structure correlations. With improved sensitivity, next-generation GW detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to probe these effects. We propose that the integrated cosmological memory (ICM) of GWs, amplified over cosmological distances, can enhance faint parity-violating signatures. Specifically, if GWs from astrophysical events have differing polarization amplitudes, as in Chern-Simons gravity, ICM significantly amplifies this disparity. ICM uniquely and independently allows us to test fundamental symmetries, constrain gravity parameters, and gain insights into the interplay of particle physics, cosmology and gravity.</description>

      <title>Whispers from the Early Universe: The Ringdown of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by the ringdown phase of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. As the ringdown signal is independent of the PBH formation mechanism, the resulting SGWB offers a model-independent probe of PBHs. We numerically compute the ringdown waveform and derive the corresponding SGWB. We show that such a signal could be detected by future pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) for PBHs heavier than the solar mass. Additionally, we evaluate the SGWB from binary PBH mergers and demonstrate that it lies within the sensitivity bands of next-generation ground-based interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, suggesting a multi-band observational strategy for probing the PBH dark matter scenario.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Algebraically special perturbations of the Kerr black hole: a metric formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbations of the Kerr black hole are notoriously difficult to describe in the metric formalism and are usually studied in terms of perturbations of the Weyl scalars. In this work, we focus on the algebraically special linear perturbations (ASLP) of the Kerr geometry and show how one can describe this subsector of the perturbations solely using the metric formulation. To that end, we consider the most general twisting algebraically special solution space of vacuum General Relativity. By linearizing around the Kerr solution, we obtain two coupled partial differential wave equations describing the dynamics of the Kerr ASLP. We provide an algorithm to solve them analytically in the small spin approximation up to third order, providing the first exact solution of this kind in the metric formulation. Then, we use this framework to study the stationary zero modes of the Kerr geometry. We present the exact analytical form of the shifts in mass and spin together with the required change of coordinates needed to identify them. Finally, we also provide for the first time closed expressions for the solution-generating perturbations generating the NUT and acceleration charges, thus deforming the Kerr solution to the linearized Kerr-NUT and spinning C-metric. These results provide a first concrete and rare example of perturbations of the Kerr black hole which can be treated entirely in the metric formulation. They can serve as a useful testbed to search for hidden symmetries of the Kerr perturbations.</description>

      <title>A Non-Commutative Kalb-Ramond Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a new black hole solution within the framework of a non-commutative gauge theory applied to Kalb-Ramond gravity. Using the method recently proposed in the literature [Nucl.Phys.B 1017 (2025) 116950], we employ the Moyal twist $\partial_r \wedge \partial_\theta$ to implement non-commutativity, being encoded by parameter $\Theta$. We begin by verifying that the resulting black hole no longer possesses spherical symmetry, while the event horizon remains unaffected by non-commutative corrections. The Kretschmann scalar is computed to assess the corresponding regularity. It turns out that the solution is regular, provided that the Christoffel symbols and related quantities are not expanded to second order in $\Theta$. We derive the thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature $T^{(\Theta,\ell)}$, entropy $S^{(\Theta,\ell)}$, and heat capacity $C_V^{(\Theta,\ell)}$. The remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$ is estimated by imposing $T^{(\Theta,\ell)} \to 0$, although the absence of a physical remnant indicates complete evaporation. Quantum radiation for bosons and fermions is analyzed via the tunneling method, where divergent integrals are treated using the residue theorem. Notably, in the low-frequency regime, the particle number density for bosons surpasses that of fermions (at least within the scope of the methods considered here). The effective potential for a massless scalar field is obtained perturbatively, enabling the computation of quasinormal modes and the time-domain profiles. Finally, further bounds on $\Theta$ and $\ell$ (Lorentz-violating paramter) are derived from solar system tests, including the perihelion precession of Mercury, light deflection, and the Shapiro time delay.</description>
