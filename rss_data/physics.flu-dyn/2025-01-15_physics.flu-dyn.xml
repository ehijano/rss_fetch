      <title>The route to turbulence in magnetohydrodynamic square duct flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition route from laminar to turbulent flow in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) duct with a square cross-section is investigated in the limit of low magnetic Reynolds number. In the presence of a transverse magnetic field, Hartmann and Shercliff layers are present on the walls orthogonal and parallel to the field direction, respectively. We assume reflection symmetries in both transverse directions, and investigate the competition between transition mechanisms specific to each boundary layer using direct numerical simulations. Independently of which wall turbulence eventually occupies, transition relies exclusively on a tripping of the Shercliff layer by perturbations, while the Hartmann layer plays a passive role. This is explained, using a dynamical systems interpretation, by the spatial localization of the edge states in the Shercliff layer at the expense of the Hartmann layer. The link between these non-linear coherent structures and the linear optimal modes known from non-modal stability and energy stability theory is pointed out.</description>

      <title>Advanced representation learning for flow field analysis and reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present advanced representation learning study on integrating deep learning techniques and sparse approximation, including diffusion models, for advanced flow field analysis and reconstruction. Key applications include super-resolution flow field reconstruction, flow field inpainting, fluid-structure interaction, transient and internal flow analyses, and reduced-order modeling. The study introduces two novel methods: flow diffusions for super-resolution tasks and a sparsity-boosted low-rank model for flow field inpainting. By leveraging cutting-edge methodologies in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the proposed approaches improve accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability, offering deeper insights into complex flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Casting Computational Fluid Mechanics into a Convex Quadratic Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the principle of minimum pressure gradient to transform problems in unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) into a convex optimization framework subject to linear constraints. This formulation permits solving, for the first time, CFD problems efficiently using well-established quadratic programming tools or using the well-known Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. The proposed approach is demonstrated using three benchmark examples. In particular, it is shown through comparison with traditional CFD tools that the proposed framework is capable of predicting the flow field in a lid-driven cavity, in a uniform pipe (Poiseuille flow), and that past a backward facing step. The results highlight the potential of the method as a simple, robust, and potentially transformative alternative to traditional CFD approaches.</description>

      <title>From directed percolation to patterned turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to turbulence is characterized by an abrupt loss of order and predictability, featuring the intermittent proliferation and decay of localized turbulent structures. En-route to becoming fully turbulent, surprisingly order reappears when alternating laminar and turbulent regions arrange in regular stripe patterns. This macroscopic organization is believed to arise top down from a classic pattern forming instability of turbulence, imprinting a wavelength onto the disordered flow field. We here demonstrate that patterns instead self-assemble with increasing velocity. Starting from the intermittent stripe regime, specifically from the corresponding directed percolation (DP) critical point, regular patterns are established within the scaling range of the DP transition. Likewise the patterns' expansion rates are set by the DP critical exponents, attesting that all underlying processes are stochastic. This apparent contradiction between the inherent stochasticity and the displayed order is resolved by abandoning the common perception of laminar and turbulence as opposing states. More generally our study exemplifies that macroscopic patterns can arise solely from local stochastic rules, in the absence of wavelength selection typically associated with pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Scaling of wall-pressure--velocity correlations in high Reynolds number turbulent pipe flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental study was conducted in the CICLoPE long-pipe facility to investigate the correlation between wall-pressure and turbulent velocity fluctuations in the logarithmic region, at high friction Reynolds numbers ($4\,794 \lesssim Re_\tau \lesssim 47\,015$). Hereby we explore the scalability of employing wall-pressure to effectively estimate off-the-wall velocity states (e.g., to be of use in real-time control of wall-turbulence). Coherence spectra for wall-pressure and streamwise (or wall-normal) velocity fluctuations collapse when plotted against $\lambda_x/y$ and thus reveals a Reynolds-number-independent scaling with distance-from-the-wall. When the squared wall-pressure fluctuations are considered instead of the linear wall-pressure term, the coherence spectra for the wall-pressure--squared and velocity are higher in amplitude at wavelengths corresponding to large-scale streamwise velocity fluctuations (e.g., at $\lambda_x/y = 60$ the coherence value increases from roughly 0.1 up to 0.3). This higher coherence typifies a modulation effect, because low-frequency content is introduced when squaring the wall-pressure time series. Finally, quadratic stochastic estimation is employed to estimate turbulent velocity fluctuations from the wall-pressure time series only. For each $Re_\tau$ investigated, the estimated time series and a true temporal measurement of velocity inside the turbulent pipe flow, yield a normalized correlation coefficient of $\rho \approx 0.6$ for all cases. This suggests that wall-pressure sensing can be employed for meaningful estimation of off-the-wall velocity fluctuations, and thus for real-time control of energetic turbulent velocity fluctuations at high $Re_\tau$ applications.</description>

      <title>Settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspension of spherical and cubic particles in Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the gravity-driven settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspensions of spherical and cubic particles within a triply periodic domain. The effect of solid volume fraction on the evolving microstructure of a suspension is numerically examined by employing the Rigid MultiBlob method under Stokes flow conditions. Our simulations accurately reproduce macroscopic trends observed in experiments and show strong agreement with established semi-empirical correlations over a wide range of volume fractions. It is observed that the hydrodynamic interactions between particles and the surrounding fluid dominate the settling mechanism at low to moderate solid volume fractions, whereas, frequent collisions between particles in a highly packed space tend to suppress velocity fluctuations at denser regime. The transport properties for dilute suspensions are found to be primarily shaped by an anisotropic microstructure, though this anisotropy decreases as many-body interactions significantly grow at higher volume fractions. Notably, cubic particles exhibit lower anisotropy in velocity fluctuations compared to spheres, due to more effective momentum and energy transfer from the gravity-driven direction to transverse directions. Moreover, cubic particles also display higher velocity fluctuations and particle rebounding after collisions, which may create a transient tendency for cubes to move against gravity more readily than spheres. The distinctive behaviors of cubic and spherical particles can notably influence the efficiency of size segregation in bidisperse mixtures. Interestingly, local velocity fluctuation intensity increases for both particle types in mixed suspensions, affecting the local sedimentation velocity field. Overall, spherical particles are found to settle faster than cubes at low to moderate volume fractions.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Wall-Pressure Spectrum Model for Aeroacoustic Predictions Based on Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast-turn around methods to predict airfoil trailing-edge noise are crucial for incorporating noise limitations into design optimization loops of several applications. Among these aeroacoustic predictive models, Amiet's theory offers the best balance between accuracy and simplicity. The accuracy of the model relies heavily on precise wall-pressure spectrum predictions, which are often based on single-equation formulations with adjustable parameters. These parameters are calibrated for particular airfoils and flow conditions and consequently tend to fail when applied outside their calibration range. This paper introduces a new wall-pressure spectrum empirical model designed to enhance the robustness and accuracy of current state-of-the-art predictions while widening the range of applicability of the model to different airfoils and flow conditions. The model is developed using AI-based symbolic regression via a genetic-algorithm-based approach, and applied to a dataset of wall-pressure fluctuations measured on NACA 0008 and NACA 63018 airfoils at multiple angles of attack and inflow velocities, covering turbulent boundary layers with both adverse and favorable pressure gradients. Validation against experimental data (outside the training dataset) demonstrates the robustness of the model compared to well-accepted semi-empirical models. Finally, the model is integrated with Amiet's theory to predict the aeroacoustic noise of a full-scale wind turbine, showing good agreement with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Flow-field analysis and performance assessment of rotating detonation engines under different number of discrete inlet nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores in depth rotating detonation engines (RDEs) fueled by premixed stoichiometric hydrogen/air mixtures through two-dimensional numerical simulations including a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism. To model the spatial reactant non-uniformities observed in practical RDE combustors, the referred simulations incorporate different numbers of discrete inlet nozzles. The primary focus here is to analyze the influence of reactant non-uniformities on detonation combustion dynamics in RDEs. By systematically varying the number of reactant injection nozzles (from 15 to 240), while maintaining a constant total injection area, the study delves into how this variation influences the behavior of rotating detonation waves (RDWs) and the associated overall flow field structure. The numerical results obtained here reveal significant effects of the number of inlets employed on both RDE stability (self-sustaining detonation wave) and performance. RDE configurations with a lower number of inlets exhibit a detonation front with chaotic behavior (pressure oscillations) due to an increased amount of unburned gas ahead of the detonation wave. This chaotic behavior can lead to the flame extinguishing or decreasing in intensity, ultimately diminishing the engine's overall performance. Conversely, RDE configurations with a higher number of inlets feature smoother detonation propagations without chaotic transients, leading to more stable and reliable performance metrics. This study uses high-fidelity numerical techniques such as adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and the PeleC compressible reacting flow solver. This comprehensive approach enables a thorough evaluation of critical RDE characteristics including detonation velocity, fuel mass flow rate, impulse, thrust, and reverse pressure waves under varying reactant injection conditions.</description>

      <title>Modelling the transition from shear-driven turbulence to convective turbulence in a vertical heated pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heated pipe flow is widely used in thermal engineering applications, but the presence of buoyancy force can cause intermittency, or multiple flow states at the same parameter values. Such changes in the flow lead to substantial changes in its heat transfer properties and thereby significant changes in the axial temperature gradient. We therefore introduce a model that features a time-dependent background axial temperature gradient, and consider two temperature boundary conditions -- fixed temperature difference and fixed boundary heat flux. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are based on the pseudo-spectral framework, and good agreement is achieved between present numerical results and experimental results. The code extends openpipeflow.org and is available at the website. The effect of the axially periodic domain on flow dynamics and heat transfer is examined, using pipes of length L=5D and L=25D. Provided that the flow is fully turbulent, results show close agreement for the mean flow and temperature profiles, and only slight differences in root-mean-square fluctuations. When the flow shows spatial intermittency, heat transfer tends to be overestimated using a short pipe, as shear turbulence fills the domain. This is particularly important when shear turbulence starts to be suppressed at intermediate buoyancy numbers. Finally, at such intermediate buoyancy numbers, we confirm that the decay of localised shear turbulence in the heated pipe flow follows a memoryless process, similar to that in isothermal flow. While isothermal flow then laminarises, convective turbulence in the heated flow can intermittently trigger bursts of shear-like turbulence.</description>

      <title>Detection and analysis of synchronization routes in an axially forced globally unstable jet using recurrence quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiperiodicity, a partially synchronous state that precedes the onset of forced synchronization in hydrodynamic systems, exhibits distinct geometrical patterns based on the specific route to lock-in. In this study, we explore these dynamic behaviors using recurrence quantification analysis. Focusing on a self-excited hydrodynamic system-a low-density jet subjected to external acoustic forcing at varying frequencies and amplitudes. We generate recurrence plots from unsteady velocity time traces. These recurrence plots provide insight into the synchronization dynamics and pathways of the jet under forced conditions. Further, we show that recurrence quantities are helpful to detect and distinguish between different routes to lock-in.</description>

      <title>A geometric formulation of the Shepard renormalization factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correct treatment of boundary conditions is a key step in the development of the SPH method. The SPH community has to face several challenges in this regard - in particular, a primordial aspect for any boundary formulation is to ensure the consistency of the operators in presence of boundaries and free surfaces. A new implementation is proposed, based on the existing numerical boundary integrals formulation. A new kernel expression is developed to compute the Shepard renormalization factor at the boundary purely as a function of the geometry. In order to evaluate this factor, the resulting expression is split into numerical and analytical parts, which allows accurately computing the Shepard factor. The new expression is satisfactorily tested for different planar geometries, showing that problems featuring free surfaces and boundaries are solved. The methodology is also extended to 3-D geometries without great increase in computational cost.</description>

      <title>Coiling instability in the kitchen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulation of viscous liquids is an essential kitchen activity - from pouring golden syrup onto a pancake to decorating a cake with whipped cream frosting, from streaming ketchup on top of French fries to dispensing molten chocolate onto a strawberry. Typical viscosities in these and many other kitchen flows, and the heights from which the streams are dispensed, make such jets susceptible to the coiling instability. Indeed, the coiling of a thin thread of poured maple syrup is a source of fascination for children and adults alike, whereas the folding of the stream of ketchup squeezed out from a plastic bottle is a phenomenon familiar to all. In this paper, we review the fluid dynamics of such kitchen flows and discuss separately the case when the substrate is stationary (honey on a toast), and when it translates (cookies on a conveyor belt) or rotates (a pancake on a spinning hot plate). It is hoped that this may encourage experimentation and enjoyment of physics in the kitchen, and perhaps even lead to more elegant if not more tasty culinary results.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices leave a macroscopic signature in the normal fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the remarkable properties of quantum turbulence in superfluid helium II, consisting of a disordered tangle of quantised vortex lines which interact with each other and reconnect when they collide. According to Landau's two-fluid theory, these vortex lines move in a surrounding of thermal excitations called the normal fluid. Until now, the normal fluid has often been considered a passive background which simply provides the vortex lines with a mechanism for dissipating their kinetic energy into heat. Using a model which fully takes into account the two-way interaction between the vortex lines and the normal fluid, here we show that each vortex line creates a macroscopic wake in the normal fluid that can be larger than the average distance between vortex lines; this is surprising, given the microscopic size of the superfluid vortex cores which induce these wakes. We show that in heat transfer experiments, the flow of the normal fluid can therefore be described as the superposition of an imposed uniform flow and wakes generated by the vortex lines, leading to non-classical statistics of the normal fluid velocity. We also argue that this first evidence of independent fluid structures in the thermal excitations postulated by Landau may be at the root of recent, unaccounted for, experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning based flow field estimation using floating sensor locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on machine learning techniques, we propose a novel method to estimate flow fields using only floating sensor locations. This method does not require either ground-truth velocity fields or governing equations for fluid flows, which is attractive for practical applications. The machine learning model in this method is supposed to generate accurate velocity fields so that the time variation of sensor motion is consistent with the given data of sensor locations. To validate the method, the estimation performance, the dependence on the number of sensors, and the robustness to noise are investigated using the two-dimensional forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence and the two-dimensional ocean currents. These investigations demonstrate the accuracy and the practicality of this method. Moreover, we observe that the present method can estimate the major structures, such as coherent structures in the forced turbulence and stable ocean currents, with only a few sensors. We believe the present method can provide effective utilisations of floating sensor observations in various fields.</description>

      <title>Lateral migration and bouncing of a deformable bubble rising near a vertical wall. Part 1. Moderately inertial regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The buoyancy-driven motion of a deformable bubble rising near a vertical hydrophilic wall is studied numerically. We focus on moderately inertial regimes in which the bubble undergoes low-to-moderate deformations and would rise in a straight line in the absence of the wall. Three different types of near-wall motion are observed, depending on the buoyancy-to-viscous and buoyancy-to-capillary force ratios defining the Galilei ($Ga$) and Bond ($Bo$) numbers of the system, respectively. For low enough $Ga$ or large enough $Bo$, bubbles consistently migrate away from the wall. Conversely, for large enough $Ga$ and low enough $Bo$, they perform periodic near-wall bounces. At intermediate $Ga$ and $Bo$, they are first attracted to the wall down to a certain critical distance, and then perform bounces with a decreasing amplitude before stabilizing at this critical separation. Periodic bounces are accompanied by the shedding of a pair of streamwise vortices in the wake, the formation of which is governed by the near-wall shear resulting from the no-slip condition. These vortices provide a repulsive force that overcomes the viscous resistance of the fluid to the departing motion, making the bubble capable of returning to the region where it is attracted again to the wall. Although periodic, the shedding/regeneration cycle of these vortices is highly asymmetric with respect to the lateral bubble displacements, vortices being shed when the gap left between the bubble and the wall reaches its maximum, and reborn only when this gap comes back to its minimum.</description>

      <title>Stokes flow of an evolving fluid film with arbitrary shape and topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of evolving fluid films in the viscous Stokes limit is relevant to various applications, such as the modeling of lipid bilayers in cells. While the governing equations were formulated by Scriven in 1960, solving for the flow of a deformable viscous surface with arbitrary shape and topology has remained a challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward discrete model based on variational principles to address this long-standing problem. We replace the classical equations, which are expressed with tensor calculus in local coordinates, with a simple coordinate-free, differential-geometric formulation. The formulation provides a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanics and directly translates to discretization. We construct a discrete analogue of the system using the Onsager variational principle, which, in a smooth context, governs the flow of a viscous medium. In the discrete setting, instead of term-wise discretizing the coordinate-based Stokes equations, we construct a discrete Rayleighian for the system and derive the discrete Stokes equations via the variational principle. This approach results in a stable, structure-preserving variational integrator that solves the system on general manifolds.</description>

      <title>Marangoni-driven patterns, ridges, and hills in surfactant-covered parametric surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric oscillations of an interface separating two fluid phases create nonlinear surface waves, called Faraday waves, which organise into simple patterns, like squares and hexagons, as well as complex structures, such as double hexagonal and superlattice patterns. In this work, we study the influence of surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses on the formation and transition of Faraday wave patterns. We use a quantity $B$, that assesses the relative importance of Marangoni stresses as compared to the the surface wave dynamics. Our results show that the threshold acceleration required to destabilise a surfactant-covered interface through vibration increases with increasing $B$. For a surfactant-free interface, a square wave pattern is observed. As $B$ is incremented, we report transitions from squares to asymmetric squares, weakly wavy stripes, and ultimately to ridges and hills. These hills are a consequence of the bi-directional Marangoni stresses at the neck of the ridges. The mechanisms underlying the pattern transitions and the formation of exotic ridges and hills are discussed.</description>
