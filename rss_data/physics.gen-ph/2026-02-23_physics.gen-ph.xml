      <title>Cosmological Bounce Relics: Black Holes, Gravitational Waves, and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for generating cosmological relics -- black holes, gravitational waves (GWs), and possibly dark matter (DM) -- in a bouncing Universe. Relics arise through two channels: (i) compact objects and GWs produced during pre-bounce collapse that remain super-horizon and re-enter after the bounce, and (ii) dark-matter halos formed during collapse that exit the horizon and collapse into black holes upon re-entry. Unlike inflationary primordial black holes, these relic black holes originate from nonlinear structure formation during collapse. We derive the particle horizon and horizon-crossing conditions in bouncing cosmology and show that perturbations or compact objects larger than 90 m survive the bounce. The resulting population of relic black holes and GWs spans a wide mass range, offering a unified origin for dark matter, gravitational-wave backgrounds, and the early growth of supermassive black holes and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Manifold Learning for Source Separation in Confusion-Limited Gravitational-Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational waves in a regime that differs sharply from what ground-based detectors such as LIGO handle. Instead of searching for rare signals buried in loud instrumental noise, LISA's main challenge is that its data stream contains millions of unresolved galactic binaries. These blend into a confusion background, and the task becomes identifying sources that stand out from that signal population. We explore whether manifold-learning tools can help with this separation problem. We built a CNN autoencoder trained on the confusion background and used its reconstruction error, while also taking advantage of geometric structure in the latent space by adding a manifold-based normalization term to the anomaly score. The model was trained on synthetic LISA data with instrumental noise and confusion background, and tested on datasets with injected resolvable sources such as massive black hole binaries, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and individual galactic binaries. A grid search over $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the combined score $\alpha \cdot \mathrm{AE}_{\mathrm{error}} + \beta \cdot \mathrm{manifold}_{\mathrm{norm}}$ found optimal performance near $\alpha = 0.5$ and $\beta = 2.0$, indicating that latent-space geometry provides more discriminatory information than reconstruction error alone. With this combination, the method achieves an AUC of $0.752$, precision $0.81$, and recall $0.61$, a $35\%$ improvement over the autoencoder alone. These results suggest that manifold-learning techniques could complement LISA data-analysis pipelines in identifying resolvable sources within confusion-limited data.</description>
