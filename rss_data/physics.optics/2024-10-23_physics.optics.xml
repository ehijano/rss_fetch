      <title>Stabilizing nanoparticles in the intensity minimum: feedback levitation on an inverted potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the stable trapping of a levitated nanoparticle on top of an inverted potential using a combination of optical readout and electrostatic control. The feedback levitation on an inverted potential (FLIP) method stabilizes the particle at an intensity minimum. By using a Kalman-filter-based linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control method, we confine a particle to within $\sigma_x = (9.0 \pm 0.5) nm$ of the potential maximum at an effective temperature of $(16 \pm 1) K$ in a room-temperature environment. Despite drifts in the absolute position of the potential maximum, we can keep the nanoparticle at the apex by estimating the drift from the particle dynamics using the Kalman filter. Our approach may enable new levitation-based sensing schemes with enhanced bandwidth. It also paves the way for optical levitation at zero intensity of an optical potential, which alleviates decoherence effects due to material-dependent absorption and is hence relevant for macroscopic quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Criteria for objects suitable for reconstruction from holograms and diffraction patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, quantitative criteria for reconstruction of objects from their hologram and diffraction patterns, and in particular for the phase objects in digital holography, are derived. The criteria that allow distinguishing the hologram and diffraction pattern are outlined. Gabor derived his criterion for objects suitable for holography based on the condition that the background in the reconstructed object's distribution should be nearly flat so that its intensity contrast does not exceed 0.05.According to Gabor, an opaque object is suitable for holographic reconstruction if it occupies no more than 0.01 of the imaged area, and a phase-shifting object cannot be reconstructed in principle. We revisit these criteria and show that both types of objects can be reconstructed when the object occupies less than 0.01 of the total illuminated area. In addition, a simplified derivation of the criteria is provided that is based on the use of Parseval's theorem, and it is shown that in general, objects (including amplitude-only and phase-only) can be reconstructed at signal-to-noise ratio of 10 or higher, provided the object occupies less than 0.005 of the total illuminated area. In addition, a simplified derivation of the criteria is provided that is based on Parseval's theorem. It is shown that for objects reconstructed from their holograms and the twin image treated as noise, the signal-to-noise ratio of 10 or higher can be achieved provided the object occupies less than 0.005 of the total illuminated area When a hologram is reconstructed by applying iterative algorithms, the requirement for the object size is much more generous and identical to that applied in coherent diffraction imaging: any type of object (amplitude-only, phase-only, or amplitude-and-phase mixed properties) is suitable for holography when the object's size in each dimension is less than half of the probed region's extent.</description>

      <title>Telecom-wavelength Single-photon Emitters in Multi-layer InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of robust and efficient single photon emitters (SPEs) at telecom wavelengths is critical for advancements in quantum information science. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently emerged as promising sources for SPEs, owing to their high photon extraction efficiency, facile coupling to external fields, and seamless integration into photonic circuits. In this study, we demonstrate the creation of SPEs emitting in the 1000 to 1550 nm near-infrared range by coupling 2D indium selenide (InSe) with strain-inducing nanopillar arrays. The emission wavelength exhibits a strong dependence on the number of layers. Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiments conducted at 10 K reveal clear photon antibunching, confirming the single-photon nature of the emissions. Density-functional-theory calculations and scanning-tunneling-microscopy analyses provide insights into the electronic structures and defect states, elucidating the origins of the SPEs. Our findings highlight the potential of multilayer 2D metal monochalcogenides for creating SPEs across a broad spectral range, paving the way for their integration into quantum communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced biochemical sensing with high-Q transmission resonances in free-standing membrane metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces provide novel solutions to label-free biochemical sensing by localizing light resonantly beyond the diffraction limit, thereby selectively enhancing light-matter interactions for improved analytical performance. However, high-Q resonances in metasurfaces are usually achieved in the reflection mode, which impedes metasurface integration into compact imaging systems. Here, we demonstrate a novel metasurface platform for advanced biochemical sensing based on the physics of the bound states in the continuum (BIC) and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) modes, which arise when two interfering resonances from a periodic pattern of tilted elliptic holes overlap both spectrally and spatially, creating a narrow transparency window in the mid-infrared spectrum. We experimentally measure these resonant peaks observed in transmission mode (Q~734 at ~8.8 um) in free-standing silicon membranes and confirm their tunability through geometric scaling. We also demonstrate the strong coupling of the BIC-EIT modes with a thinly coated PMMA film on the metasurface, characterized by a large Rabi splitting (32 cm-1) and biosensing of protein monolayers in transmission mode. Our new photonic platform can facilitate the integration of metasurface biochemical sensors into compact and monolithic optical systems while being compatible with scalable manufacturing, thereby clearing the way for on-site biochemical sensing in everyday applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel OOK Communication by Using Frequency-multiplexed Switchable Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable metasurfaces have recently attracted considerable interest for their versatile applications in areas such as beam steering, holography, and wireless communications, utilizing either phase or amplitude modulation. Despite this, programmable amplitude coding modulation has seen limited exploration, primarily due to the difficulties involved in achieving real-time dynamic amplitude control. Here, we propose a reprogrammable amplitude-coding metasurface utilizing the on-off Keying (OOK) method combined with frequency modulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we will address both the design of the metasurface and the theoretical investigation of OOK simultaneously, considering all parameters present in the design, channel, and on-off ratio. The proposed metasurface comprises two layers of graphene with separate biasing voltages. By controlling the chemical potential of each layer, we can modulate the amplitude in two states at two frequencies through a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). In addition, we employ an information encryption method using the substitution cipher method and transmit it at two amplitude levels at distinct frequencies of f1 = 0.98 THz and f2 = 1.46 THz to safeguard transmission information against eavesdropping. Simulation and numerical results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed reprogrammable metasurface facilitates secure communication in multi-channel data encryption, terahertz (THz) data storage, information processing, and THz communication.</description>

      <title>Enhanced polariton interactions in suspended WS2 monolayer microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenides monolayers exhibit strong exciton resonances that enable intense light-matter interactions at room temperature (RT). However, the sensitivity of these materials to the surrounding environment and their intense interactions with the sustaining substrate result in the enhancement of excitonic losses through scattering, dissociation and defects formation, hindering their full potential for the excitation of optical nonlinearities in exciton-polariton platforms. From this point of view, the use of suspended monolayers holds the potential to completely eliminate substrate-induced losses, offering unique advantages for the investigation and exploitation of intrinsic electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of 2D materials based polaritonic systems, without any influence of proximity effects of all sort. In this work, we report a novel fabrication approach enabling the realization of a planar {\lambda}/2 microcavity filled with a suspended WS2 monolayer in its centre. In such a system, we experimentally demonstrate a 2-fold enhancement of the strong coupling at RT, due to reduced overall losses as compared to similar systems based on dielectric-filled microcavities. Moreover, as a result of minimized losses, spin-dependent polaritonic interactions in our platform are significantly amplified, leading to achievement of a record exciton interaction constant approaching the theoretically predicted value at RT, without making use of theoretical hypothesis on the effective polariton densities. This approach holds promises for pushing 2D materials-based polaritonic systems to their intrinsic limits, paving the way for the realization of novel polaritonic devices with superior performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the symmetry of optical and mechanical waves is pivotal to their full exploitation in technological applications and topology-linked fundamental physics experiments. Leveraging on the control of orbital angular momentum, we introduce here a device forming super-high-frequency-modulated optical vortex beams via acousto-optic interaction of light with acoustic vortices. Originated by shape-engineering of a single-contact bulk acoustic wave resonator, we generate vortices in a wide band of frequencies around 4 GHz and with frequency/geometrically tunable topological charge from 1 to 13 and beyond. With all electrical control and on-chip integration our device offers new solutions for angular-momentum-based light communication, three-dimensional particle manipulation, as well as novel interaction schemes for optomechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Variational MineGAN: A Data-efficient Knowledge Transfer Architecture for Generative AI-assisted Design of Nanophotonic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the power of deep learning to design nanophotonic devices has been an area of active research in recent times, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) being a popular choice alongside autoencoder-based methods. However, both approaches typically require large datasets and significant computational resources, which can outweigh the advantages of saving time and effort. While GANs trained on smaller datasets can experience challenges such as unstable training and mode collapse, fine-tuning pre-trained GANs on these limited datasets often introduces additional problems, such as overfitting and lack of flexibility. This limits the model's ability to generalize, reducing its overall effectiveness. In this study, we present Variational MineGAN, an enhanced version of MineGAN that is less susceptible to overfitting while leveraging pre-trained GANs. This approach ensures a more robust sampling process, improving the model's generalization ability while transferring knowledge to domains with limited data. Experimental results demonstrate a lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 52.14, along with an increased Inception Score (IS) of 3.59 compared to prior methods. This implies better quality design images, which allow for the exploration of highly efficient designs with desired spectral responses and improved learning of nonlinear relationships between the latent space and the corresponding designs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Electromagnetic Surface Waves at the Interface Between Perfect Electric Conductor and Perfect Magnetic Conductor Parallel-Plate Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new electromagnetic surface waves at the interface formed by connecting a perfect electric conductor (PEC) and a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) parallel plate waveguides containing materials with positive permittivities and permeabilities. This challenges the conventional understanding that surface waves require materials with negative permittivity or permeability. Theoretical mode analysis and numerical simulations have confirmed the existence of surface waves at the PEC-PMC interface. Additionally, a simulated prism coupling experiment validated the excitation of the surface wave at the PEC-PMC interface. The resonant response of the localized surface waves on the enclosed PEC-PMC surface of a cylinder also closely resembles that of a Drude cylinder. Our finding broadens the understanding of the conditions for generating electromagnetic surface waves and deepens our comprehension of electromagnetic phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new exceptional point (EP) conditions of the coupled microring resonators using coupled mode theory in space, a more accurate approach than the commonly used coupled mode theory in time. Transmission spectra around EPs obtained from the two models have been compared on two material platforms, revealing non-negligible deviations. Our analysis provides a guide for accurately determining parameter sets of coupled microrings at EPs and deepens our understanding on parity-time-symmetric coupled resonators at EPs.</description>

      <title>New geometric receipts for design of photonic crystals and metamaterials: optimal toric packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design of photonic crystals having large bandgaps above a prescribed band is a well-known physical problem with many applications. A connection to an interesting mathematical construction was pointed out some time ago: it had been conjectured that optimal structures for gaps between bands n and n+1 correspond, in case of transverse magnetic polarisation, to rods located at the generators of centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), and in case of transverse electric polarisation to the walls of this tessellation. We discover another mathematical receipt which produces even better solutions: optimal packing of discs in square and triangular tori. It provides solutions qualitatively different from CVT, sometimes increasing the resulting bandgap size in several times. We therefore introduce two new classes of periodic structures with remarkable properties which may find applications in many other areas of modern solid state physics: arrays of particles located at the centers of optimally packed discs on tori, and nets corresponding to the walls of their Voronoi tessellations.</description>

      <title>Generation of non-classical and entangled light states using intense laser-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-classical and entangled light states are of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics and they are a powerful tool for the emergence of new quantum technologies. The development of methods that can lead to the generation of such light states is therefore of high importance. Recently, we have demonstrated that intense laser-matter interactions can serve towards this direction. Specifically, we have shown how the use of fully quantized approaches in intense laser-matter interactions and the process of high harmonic generation, can lead to the generation high photon-number non-classical (optical Schr\"{o}dinger's "cat" or squeezed) and entangled states from the far-infrared (IR) to the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV). Here, after a brief introduction on the fundamentals, we summarize the operation principles of these approaches and we discuss the future directions of non-classical light engineering using strong laser fields, and the potential applications in ultrafast and quantum information science. Our findings open the way to a novel quantum nonlinear spectroscopy method, based on the interplay between the quantum properties of light with that of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>First Photon Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum techniques are expected to revolutionize how information is acquired, exchanged, and processed. Yet it has been a challenge to realize and measure their values in practical settings. We present first photon machine learning as a new paradigm of neural networks and establish the first unambiguous advantage of quantum effects for artificial intelligence. By extending the physics behind the double-slit experiment for quantum particles to a many-slit version, our experiment finds that a single photon can perform image recognition at around $30\%$ fidelity, which beats by a large margin the theoretical limit of what a similar classical system can possibly achieve (about 24\%). In this experiment, the entire neural network is implemented in sub-attojoule optics and the equivalent per-calculation energy cost is below $10^{-24}$ joule, highlighting the prospects of quantum optical machine learning for unparalleled advantages in speed, capacity, and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Wannier interpolation of reciprocal-space periodic and non-periodic matrix elements in the optimally smooth subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximally localized Wannier functions use the gauge freedom of Bloch wavefunctions to define the optimally smooth subspace with matrix elements that depend smoothly on crystal momentum. The associated Wannier functions are real-space localized, a feature often used to Fourier interpolate periodic observables in reciprocal space on ultradense momentum grids. However, Fourier interpolation cannot handle non-periodic quantities in reciprocal space, such as the oscillator strength matrix elements, which are crucial for the evaluation of optical properties. We show that a direct multidimensional interpolation in the optimally smooth subspace yields comparable accuracy with respect to Fourier interpolation at a similar or lower computational cost. This approach can also interpolate and extrapolate non-periodic observables, enabling the calculation of optical properties on ultradense momentum grids. Finally, we underline that direct interpolation in the optimally smooth subspace can be employed for periodic and non-periodic tensors of any order without any information on the position of the Wannier centers in real space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional spectroscopy (2DS) offers significant advantages in terms of high temporal and frequency resolutions and signal-to-noise ratio. Until now, the response-function (RF) formalism has been the prevalent theoretical description. In this study, we compare the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) method with the RF formalism in a three-level system with a constant control field. We obtain the signals from both approaches and compare their population dynamics and 2DS. We propose the quasi-Green function for the NHH method, which allows all possible Liouville paths to be inferred. Although the NHH method overestimates relaxations, it also provides a more comprehensive description. Our results demonstrate that the NHH method is more suitable than the RF formalism for investigating the systems that are either dissipative or complex via the 2DS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple modification of space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector optical benches which would enable the measurement of vacuum birefringence of light induced by axion dark matterthrough its coupling to electromagnetism. While marginally affecting the sensitivity to GW by a factor $\sqrt{2}$, we show that such an adjustment would make future detectors such as LISA, TianQin, Taiji and Big-Bang Observer the most sensitive experiments at low axion masses</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is nowadays one of the most interesting applications of SERS, in particular for single molecule studies. In fact, it enables the study of real-time processes at the molecular level. This review summarizes the latest developments in dynamic SERS techniques and their applications, focusing on new instrumentation, data analysis methods, temporal resolution and sensitivity improvements, and novel substrates. We highlight the progress and applications of single-molecule dynamic SERS in monitoring chemical reactions, catalysis, biomolecular interactions, conformational dynamics, and real-time sensing and detection. We aim to provide a comprehensive review on its advancements, applications as well as its current challenges and development frontiers.</description>

      <title>Testing local realistic hidden-variable theories without inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many of the tests of local realistic hidden-variable theories against quantum mechanics are based on inequalities such as Bell's inequality and Clauser Horne, Shimony, and Holt's inequality. In this work we present a simple alternative test which does not involve inequalities, but direct comparison between correlation functions. The main advantage of this test is that it does not require measuring incompatible observables separately and simultaneously. This implies that our result, differently from traditional inequalities, does not involve counterfactual reasoning.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Optical Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models cover various application areas, including image, video and music synthesis, natural language processing, and molecular design, among many others. As digital generative models become larger, scalable inference in a fast and energy-efficient manner becomes a challenge. Here, we present optical generative models inspired by diffusion models, where a shallow and fast digital encoder first maps random noise into phase patterns that serve as optical generative seeds for a desired data distribution; a jointly-trained free-space-based reconfigurable decoder all-optically processes these generative seeds to create novel images (never seen before) following the target data distribution. Except for the illumination power and the random seed generation through a shallow encoder, these optical generative models do not consume computing power during the synthesis of novel images. We report the optical generation of monochrome and multi-color novel images of handwritten digits, fashion products, butterflies, and human faces, following the data distributions of MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Butterflies-100, and Celeb-A datasets, respectively, achieving an overall performance comparable to digital neural network-based generative models. To experimentally demonstrate optical generative models, we used visible light to generate, in a snapshot, novel images of handwritten digits and fashion products. These optical generative models might pave the way for energy-efficient, scalable and rapid inference tasks, further exploiting the potentials of optics and photonics for artificial intelligence-generated content.</description>

      <title>Quantum optomechanical control of long-lived bulk acoustic phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum optomechanical control of a mechanical oscillator requires the ability to perform efficient, low-noise operations on long-lived phononic excitations. Microfabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonators ($\mathrm{\mu}$HBARs) have been shown to support high-frequency (&gt; 10 GHz) mechanical modes with exceptionally long coherence times (&gt; 1.5 ms), making them a compelling resource for quantum optomechanical experiments. In this paper, we demonstrate a new optomechanical system that permits quantum optomechanical control of individual high-coherence phonon modes supported by such $\mathrm{\mu}$HBARs for the first time. We use this system to perform laser cooling of such ultra-massive (7.5 $\mathrm{\mu}$g) high frequency (12.6 GHz) phonon modes from an occupation of ${\sim}$22 to fewer than 0.4 phonons, corresponding to laser-based ground-state cooling of the most massive mechanical object to date. Through these laser cooling experiments, no absorption-induced heating is observed, demonstrating the resilience of the $\mathrm{\mu}$HBAR against parasitic heating. The unique features of such $\mathrm{\mu}$HBARs make them promising as the basis for a new class of quantum optomechanical systems that offer enhanced robustness to decoherence, necessary for efficient, low-noise photon-phonon conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a novel method to generate arbitrary optical focus arrays (OFAs). Our approach rapidly produces computer-generated holograms (CGHs) to precisely control the positions and the intensities of the foci. This is achieved by replacing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) operation in the conventional iterative Fourier-transform algorithm (IFTA) with a linear algebra one, identifying/removing zero elements from the matrices, and employing a generalized weighting strategy. On the premise of accelerating the calculation speed by &gt;70 times, we demonstrate OFA with 99% intensity precision in the experiment. Our method proves effective and is applicable for the systems in which real-time OFA generation is essential.</description>

Abstract: In Floquet engineering, we apply a time-periodic modulation to change the effective behavior of a wave system. In this work, we generalize Floquet engineering to exploit spatial degrees of freedom, expanding the scope of effective behaviors we can access. We develop a perturbative procedure to engineer space-time dependent driving forces that effectively transform broad classes of tight-binding systems into one another. We demonstrate several applications, including removing disorder, undoing Anderson localization, and enhancing localization to an extreme in spatially modulated waveguides. This procedure straightforwardly extends to other types of physical systems and different Floquet driving field implementations.</description>

      <title>Trapping light in air with membrane metasurfaces for vibrational strong coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces can manipulate electromagnetic waves in unprecedented ways at ultra-thin engineered interfaces. Specifically, in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) region, metasurfaces have enabled numerous biochemical sensing, spectroscopy, and vibrational strong coupling (VSC) applications via enhanced light-matter interactions in resonant cavities. However, mid-IR metasurfaces are usually fabricated on solid supporting substrates, which degrade resonance quality factors (Q) and hinder efficient sample access to the near-field electromagnetic hotspots. Besides, typical IR-transparent substrate materials with low refractive indices, such as CaF2, NaCl, KBr, and ZnSe, are usually either water-soluble, expensive, or not compatible with low-cost mass manufacturing processes. Here, we present novel free-standing Si-membrane mid-IR metasurfaces with strong light-trapping capabilities in accessible air voids. We employ the Brillouin zone folding technique to excite tunable, high-Q quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BIC) resonances with our highest measured Q-factor of 722. Leveraging the strong field localizations in accessible air cavities, we demonstrate VSC with multiple quantities of PMMA molecules and the q-BIC modes at various detuning frequencies. Our new approach of fabricating mid-IR metasurfaces into semiconductor membranes enables scalable manufacturing of mid-IR photonic devices and provides exciting opportunities for quantum-coherent light-matter interactions, biochemical sensing, and polaritonic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Nanocavity to Boost Single Photon Emission from Defects in Thin Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and compact single photon emission platforms operating at room temperature with ultrafast speed and high brightness will be fundamental components of the emerging quantum communications and computing fields. However, so far, it is very challenging to design practical deterministic single photon emitters based on nanoscale solid-state materials that meet the fast emission rate and strong brightness demands. Here, a solution is provided to this longstanding problem by using metallic nanocavities integrated with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes with defects acting as nanoscale single photon emitters (SPEs) at room temperature. The presented hybrid nanophotonic structure creates a rapid speedup and large enhancement in single photon emission at room temperature. Hence, the nonclassical light emission performance is substantially improved compared to plain hBN flakes and hBN on gold-layered structures without nanocavity. Extensive theoretical calculations are also performed to accurately model the new hybrid nanophotonic system and prove that the incorporation of plasmonic nanocavity is key to efficient SPE performance. The proposed quantum nanocavity single photon source is expected to be an element of paramount importance to the envisioned room-temperature integrated quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Cosmology analogy for perfect hyperlens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of super-resolution lenses such as superlens and hyperlens, coupled with advancements in metamaterials, the diffraction limit of approximately half wavelength is no longer unbreakable. However, superlenses are easily affected by weak intrinsic losses and hyperlenses cannot achieve perfect imaging, significantly constraining their practical utility. To address these challenges, here we propose a perfect hyperlens based on the metric of de Sitter spacetime in cosmology. Importantly, perfect hyperlens is capable of self-focusing in geometrical optics while supporting propagating waves with exceptionally large wavenumbers, which endows it with key advantages such as ultra-high resolution, no aberration and strong robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the hyperbolic focusing performance and mimic the de Sitter spacetime in naturally in-plane hyperbolic polaritons of {\alpha}-MoO3 films numerically, which can be achieved with a gradient thickness profile. Our work provides cosmological insights into the field regulation in hyperbolic materials, greatly innovates the design principles of traditional imaging lenses.</description>

Abstract: In the present project, we study the dynamics of the two-level system coupled with the multimode optical system. In particular, we considered a square lattice of optical fibers. We aimed to answer whether we can infer information about the thermalization of optical modes through the thermalization of two-level atoms. After averaging over the set of modes, the dynamic of the two-level system is free of quantum revivals, and that is the signature of thermalization. We showed that the temperature of the two-level system increases with the temperature of optical modes and mean photon number. In the high-temperature limit of optical modes, the temperature of the level system tends to be infinity, and level populations are equal.</description>

      <title>Skew scattering and ratchet effect in photonic graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to a comprehensive theoretical study of asymmetric (skew) scattering in photonic graphene, with the main focus on its realization with semiconductor microcavity exciton-polaritons. As an important consequence of the skew scattering, we prove the appearance of the ratchet effect in this system. Triangular defects in the form of missing micropillars in a regular honeycomb lattice are considered as ones that break the spatial inversion symmetry, thus providing the possibility of the ratchet effect. By means of the numerical solution of the effective Schr\"odinger equation, we provide microscopical insight into the process of skew scattering and determine indicatrices, cross-sections, and asymmetry parameters. In a system with multiple coherently oriented triangular defects, a macroscopic ratchet effect occurs as a unidirectional flux upon noise-like initial conditions. Our study broadens the concept of ratchet phenomena in the field of photonics and optics of exciton-polaritons.</description>

      <title>X-ray nano-holotomography reconstruction with simultaneous probe retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional tomographic reconstruction, the pre-processing step includes flat-field correction, where each sample projection on the detector is divided by a reference image taken without the sample. When using coherent X-rays as probe, this approach overlooks the phase component of the illumination field (probe), leading to artifacts in phase-retrieved projection images, which are then propagated to the reconstructed 3D sample representation. The problem intensifies in nano-holotomography with focusing optics, that due to various imperfections create high-frequency components in the probe function. Here, we present a new iterative reconstruction scheme for holotomography, simultaneously retrieving the complex-valued probe function. Implemented on GPUs, this algorithm results in 3D reconstruction resolving twice thinner layers in a 3D ALD standard sample measured using nano-holotomography.</description>
