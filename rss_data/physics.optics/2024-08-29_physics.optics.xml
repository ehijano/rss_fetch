      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical skyrmion beams, which encompass two-dimensional topology in their spatial structures, are promising for ultra-dense optical communications and advanced matter manipulation. Generating such light beams via a chip-based approach will vastly broaden their applications and promote the advancement of untapped fundamental science. Here, we present a breakthrough in chip-based technology by experimentally demonstrating on-chip devices capable of generating optical skyrmions with tailored topological invariants. These devices, fabricated with high precision, exhibit behavior that closely aligns with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. The realization of on-chip optical skyrmion beam generators ushers a new dawn in optical and material science.</description>

      <title>Anchor-Controlled Generative Adversarial Network for High-Fidelity Electromagnetic and Structurally Diverse Metasurface Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optoelectronics, designing free-form metasurfaces presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving high electromagnetic response fidelity due to the complex relationship between physical structures and electromagnetic behaviors. A key difficulty arises from the one-to-many mapping dilemma, where multiple distinct physical structures can yield similar electromagnetic responses, complicating the design process. This paper introduces a novel generative framework, the Anchor-controlled Generative Adversarial Network (AcGAN), which prioritizes electromagnetic fidelity while effectively navigating the one-to-many challenge to create structurally diverse metasurfaces. Unlike existing methods that mainly replicate physical appearances, AcGAN excels in generating a variety of structures that, despite their differences in physical attributes, exhibit similar electromagnetic responses, thereby accommodating fabrication constraints and tolerances. We introduce the Spectral Overlap Coefficient (SOC) as a precise metric to measure the spectral fidelity between generated designs and their targets. Additionally, a cluster-guided controller refines input processing, ensuring multi-level spectral integration and enhancing electromagnetic fidelity. The integration of AnchorNet into our loss function facilitates a nuanced assessment of electromagnetic qualities, supported by a dynamic loss weighting strategy that optimizes spectral alignment. Collectively, these innovations represent a transformative stride in metasurface inverse design, advancing electromagnetic response-oriented engineering and overcoming the complexities of the one-to-many mapping dilemma.Empirical evidence underscores AcGAN's effectiveness in streamlining the design process, achieving superior electromagnetic precision, and fostering a broad spectrum of design possibilities.</description>

      <title>Gain/Loss-free Non-Hermitian Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the ease of using optical gain or loss, it's widely believed that photonics provides an ideal platform to explore various non-Hermitian (NH) paradigms. Here, without any gain or loss, the non-Bloch wave transport that is unique to NH systems is demonstrated at the junction of the two dimensional Chern insulator and the normal conductor. In the band gap of the non-trivial Chern insulator, the interface between two material types can be effectively described by a one-dimensional NH Hamiltonian--such NH character of the interface is ascribed to the conductor self-energy of a reservoir. As a consequence of asymmetric hopping terms in the interface Hamiltonian, theoretical analysis shows that the wave propagation along the interface exhibits dissipative non-reciprocity (dubed non-Bloch transport). What's more, this anomaly transport is verified in the junction formed by the electromagnetic metamaterial which is constructed by the reverse-design strategy; the strategy enables the general solution of metamaterial structures for emulating any tight-binding models. Further, implementing this strategy, we also investigate the gapless boundary modes in the Haldane-like hyperbolic metamaterial. Our work provides a conceptually rich avenue to construct NH systems for both optics and electronics.</description>

      <title>Realization of geometric phase topology induced by multiple exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have Riemann surface structures of complex eigenvalues that admit singularities known as exceptional points. Combining with geometric phases of eigenstates gives rise to unique properties of non-Hermitian systems, and their classifications have been studied recently. However, the physical realizations of classes of the classifications have been relatively limited because a small number of modes and exceptional points are involved. In this work, we show in microcavities that all five classes [J.-W. Ryu, et al., Commun. Phys. 7, 109 (2024)] of three modes can emerge with three exceptional points. In demonstrations, we identified various combinations of exceptional points within a two-dimensional parameter space of a single microcavity and defined five distinct encircling loops based on three selected exceptional points. According to the classification, these loops facilitate different mode exchanges and the acquisition of additional geometric phases during the adiabatic encircling of exceptional points. Our results provide a broad description of the geometric phases-associated topology induced by multiple exceptional points in realistic physical systems.</description>

      <title>Ultranarrow-linewidth Wavelength-Vortex Metasurface Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin metasurface holograms, with thicknesses comparable to the operating wavelength, leverage multiple degrees of freedom of light to address independent image channels, thereby significantly enhancing information capacity. Although the wavelength of light can be used to encode holographic image channels, high-capacity wavelength-multiplexing holography has traditionally been achieved only through 3D volume holograms based on Bragg diffraction. We demonstrate ultranarrow-linewidth wavelength-vortex multiplexing holography in ultrathin metasurface holograms. By applying dispersion engineering to the elementary grating functions of a multiplexing hologram, we develop a sparse k-vector-filtering aperture array in momentum space that achieves sharp wavelength selectivity in conjunction with orbital angular momentum selectivity. Further leveraging transformer neural networks for the design of phase-only multiplexing holograms, we reconstruct up to 118 independent image channels from a single metasurface hologram, achieving an ultranarrow linewidth of 2 nm in the visible range. Finally, we apply the developed wavelength-vortex multiplexing metasurface holograms for holographic visual cryptography, achieving unprecedented security with an information rate more than 2500 times higher than that of traditional visual cryptography schemes. Our results open exciting avenues for the use of metasurface holograms in various applications, including 3D displays, holographic encryption, beam shaping, LiDAR, microscopy, data storage, and optical artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Digital stabilization of an IQ modulator in the carrier suppressed single side-band (CS-SSB) mode for atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-digital method for stabilising the phase biases in an electro-optic I/Q modulator for carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. Building on the method presented in S. Wald \ea, Appl. Opt. \textbf{62}, 1-7 (2023), we use the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 platform to digitally generate and demodulate an auxiliary radio-frequency tone whose beat with the optical carrier probes the I/Q modulator's phase imbalances. We implement a multiple-input, multiple-output integral feedback controller which accounts for unavoidable cross-couplings in the phase biases to lock the error signals at exactly zero where optical power fluctuations have no impact on phase stability. We demonstrate $&gt;23\,\rm dB$ suppression of the optical carrier relative to the desired sideband at $+3.4\,\rm GHz$ over a period of $15$ hours and over temperature variations of $20^\circ\rm C$.</description>

      <title>Squeezed dual-comb spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser spectroscopy and interferometry have provided an unparalleled view into the fundamental nature of matter and the universe through ultra-precise measurements of atomic transition frequencies and gravitational waves. Optical frequency combs have expanded metrology capabilities by phase-coherently bridging radio frequency and optical domains to enable traceable high-resolution spectroscopy across bandwidths greater than hundreds of terahertz. However, quantum mechanics limits the measurement precision achievable with laser frequency combs and traditional laser sources, ultimately impacting fundamental interferometry and spectroscopy. Squeezing the distribution of quantum noise to enhance measurement precision of either the amplitude or phase quadrature of an optical field leads to significant measurement improvements with continuous wave lasers. In this work, we generate bright amplitude-squeezed frequency comb light and apply it to molecular spectroscopy using interferometry that leverages the high-speed and broad spectral coverage of the dual-comb technique. Using the Kerr effect in nonlinear optical fiber, the amplitude quadrature of a frequency comb centered at 1560 nm is squeezed by &gt;3 dB over a 2.5 THz of bandwidth that includes 2500 comb teeth spaced by 1 GHz. Interferometry with a second coherent state frequency comb yields mode-resolved spectroscopy of hydrogen sulfide gas with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) nearly 3 dB beyond the shot noise limit, taking full metrological advantage of the amplitude squeezing when the electrical noise floor is considered. The quantum noise reduction leads to a two-fold quantum speedup in the determination of gas concentration, with impact for fast, broadband, and high SNR ratio measurements of multiple species in dynamic chemical environments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear refractive index changes and absorption coefficients in mesoscopic ring induced by variable effective mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the linear and nonlinear optical absorption coefficients (OAC) and refractive index changes (RIC) in quantum dot and quantum antidot systems with a position-dependent variable effective mass. Significant contributions to both linear and nonlinear OAC and RIC are observed. Our findings reveal that variations of the mass parameter modify the intersubband dipole matrix elements and energy intervals, leading to noticeable shifts in optical properties. The results show that higher {\gamma} values shift resonance peaks towards higher energies, while changes in the oscillator frequency result in abrupt shifts and peak diminutions. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the optical behaviors in the quantum systems under consideration, paving the way for designing devices with optimal efficiency</description>

      <title>Optical Spring Tracking for Enhancing Quantum-Limited Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern interferometers such as LIGO have achieved sensitivities limited by quantum noise, comprised of radiation pressure and shot noise. To mitigate this noise, a static system is employed that minimizes the quantum noise within the measurement band. However, since gravitational wave inspiral signals are a single frequency changing over time, only noise at the chirp frequency needs to be minimized. Here we demonstrate dynamically tracking a target signal using an optical spring, resulting in an increased signal to noise ratio (SNR). We report on a SNR increase by up to a factor of 40 when compared to a static configuration.</description>

      <title>Estimation Enhancing in Optoelectronic Property: A Novel Approach Using Orbital Interaction Parameters and Tight-Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper advocates for an innovative approach designed for estimating optoelectronic properties of quantum structures utilizing Tight-Binding (TB) theory. Predicated on the comparative analysis between estimated and actual properties, the study strives to validate the efficacy of this proposed technique; focusing notably on the computation of bandgap energy. It is observed that preceding methodologies offered a restricted accuracy when predicting complex structures like super-lattices and quantum wells. To address this gap, we propose a methodology involving three distinct phases using orbital interaction parameters (OIPs) and the TB theory. The research employed Aluminium Arsenide (AlAs) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) as the primary bulk materials. Our novel approach introduces a computation framework that first focuses on bulk computation, subsequently expanding to super-lattice structures. The findings of this research demonstrate promising results regarding the accuracy of predicated optoelectronic properties, particularly the cut-off wavelength. This study paves the way for future research, potentially enhancing the precision of the proposed methodology and its application scope within the field of quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Chemometrics-aided Surface-enhanced Raman spectrometric detection and quantification of GH and TE hormones in blood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the use of Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) combined with artificial neural network (ANN) models to detect and quantify growth hormone (GH) and testosterone (TE) in the blood of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. SERS spectra were recorded from blood samples of SD rats injected with GH, TE, both hormones, and non-injected controls using 785 nm laser excitation. The samples were mixed with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized in distilled water, applied onto a microscope slide, and air-dried. The resulting SERS spectra displayed similar profiles with intensity variations depending on the hormone, revealing specific bands at 658, 798, 878, 914, 932, 1064, 1190, 1354, 1410, and 1658 cm-1. PCA analysis indicated time-dependent intensity changes in bands centered around 1378 (all groups), 658 and 1614 cm-1 (GH-injected rats), and others for different hormone combinations. These variations reflect subtle biochemical changes induced by hormone injections. The ANN models, trained with six PCA scores of blood spiked with various hormone concentrations, showed high accuracy, with coefficients of determination greater than 87.71% and low root mean square error (RMSE) values below 0.6436. The hormone levels in injected rats increased initially and later declined, a trend confirmed by ELISA kits. Although ELISA and SERS produced similar results, SERS offered advantages such as rapid analysis (about two minutes), simple sample preparation, small sample volumes, and non-specificity to hormones. This suggests that SERS, combined with ANN models, could be used to detect exogenous sports dopants. These findings expand the potential applications of SERS in sports science, clinical diagnostics, and biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Beating the aliasing limit with aperiodic monotile arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal wave sampling methods has far-reaching implications in wave physics, such as seismology, acoustics, and telecommunications. A key challenge is surpassing the Whittaker-Nyquist-Shannon (WNS) aliasing limit, establishing a frequency below which the signal cannot be faithfully reconstructed. However, the WNS limit applies only to periodic sampling, opening the door to bypass aliasing by aperiodic sampling. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of a recently discovered family of aperiodic monotile tilings, the Hat family, in overcoming the aliasing limit when spatially sampling a wavefield. By analyzing their spectral properties, we show that monotile aperiodic seismic (MAS) arrays, based on a subset of the Hat tiling family, are efficient in surpassing the WNS sampling limit. Our investigation leads us to propose MAS arrays as a novel design principle for seismic arrays. We show that MAS arrays can outperform regular and other aperiodic arrays in realistic beamforming scenarios using single and distributed sources, including station-position noise. While current seismic arrays optimize beamforming or imaging applications using spiral or regular arrays, MAS arrays can accommodate both, as they share properties with both periodic and aperiodic arrays. More generally, our work suggests that aperiodic monotiles can be an efficient design principle in various fields requiring wave sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through comprehensive data analysis, we demonstrate that a ${\chi}^{(2)}$-induced artifact, arising from imperfect balancing in the conventional electro-optic sampling (EOS) detection scheme, contributes significantly to the measured signal in 2D Raman-THz spectroscopy of non-centrosymmetric materials. The artifact is a product of two 1D responses, overwhelming the desired 2D response. We confirm that by analyzing the 2D Raman-THz response of a x-cut beta barium borate (BBO) crystal. We furthermore show that this artifact can be effectively suppressed by implementing a special detection scheme. We successfully isolate the desired third-order 2D Raman-THz response, revealing a distinct cross-peak feature, whose frequency position suggests the coupling between two crystal phonons.</description>

      <title>Long-range ballistic propagation of 80$\%$-excitonic-fraction polaritons in a perovskite metasurface at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons, hybrid light-matter elementary excitations arising from the strong coupling regime between excitons in semiconductors and photons in photonic nanostructures, offer a fruitful playground to explore the physics of quantum fluids of light as well as to develop all-optical devices. However, achieving room temperature propagation of polaritons with a large excitonic fraction, which would be crucial, e.g., for nonlinear light transport in prospective devices, remains a significant challenge. } Here we report on experimental studies of exciton-polariton propagation at room temperature in resonant metasurfaces made from a sub-wavelength lattice of perovskite pillars. Thanks to the large Rabi splitting, an order of magnitude larger than the optical phonon energy, the lower polariton band is completely decoupled from the phonon bath of perovskite crystals. The long lifetime of these cooled polaritons, in combination with the high group velocity achieved through the metasurface design, enables long-range propagation regardless of the polariton excitonic fraction. Remarkably, we observed propagation distances exceeding hundreds of micrometers at room temperature, even when the polaritons possess a very high excitonic component, approximately {80}$\%$. Furthermore, the design of the metasurface introduces an original mechanism for directing uni-directional propagation through polarization control. This discovery of a ballistic propagation mode, leveraging high-speed cooled polaritons, heralds a promising avenue for the development of advanced polaritonic devices.</description>

Abstract: Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.</description>
