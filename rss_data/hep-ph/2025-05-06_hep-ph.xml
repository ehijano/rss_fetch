      <title>Photo- and Hadrodisintegration constraints on massive relics decaying into neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the cosmological constraints on the decay of a relic particle $\phi$ into neutrinos, $\phi \rightarrow \nu \bar{\nu}$, in particular those arising from the observed light-element abundances in the early Universe. We focus on the late-time disintegration of the light elements previously synthesised during BBN. Several processes are relevant, including final-state radiation associated with the decay, as well as subsequent interactions of the injected neutrinos with the thermal background neutrinos or between themselves. All processes generically contribute to the production of electromagnetic and often also hadronic material and may therefore induce late-time photodisintegration and hadrodisintegration reactions, i.e.~the destruction of light elements that have previously been formed during BBN. Here, we examine this scenario with a Monte-Carlo inspired probabilistic approach rather than Boltzmann techniques, taking into account all of these different reactions as well as their interplay. We find the resulting constraints to be very significant, covering a broad range of previously unexplored masses and lifetimes of the relic source particle.</description>

      <title>Probing "Continuous Spin" QED with Rare Atomic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An intriguing and elementary possibility is that familiar massless particles like the photon could be "continuous spin" particles (CSP) with a small but non-zero spin Casimir $\rho$. In this case, the familiar two polarization states of the photon are accompanied by an infinite tower of integer spaced helicity modes, with couplings dictated entirely by Lorentz symmetry and the parameter $\rho$. We present a formalism for computing bound state atomic transitions for scalar QED when $\rho \neq 0$, employing path integral methods not often used for bound state computations, but that readily generalize to the CSP case. We compute several illustrative amplitudes and show that $\rho\neq 0$ opens new decay channels for atomic transitions with rates controlled by $\rho\alpha/\omega$ for transition frequency $\omega$. These new channels can appreciably modify the rates of "forbidden" transitions. For example, the lifetime of the hydrogen $2s$ state would be affected at $O(1)$ for $\rho\sim 0.1$ eV, suggesting new directions for fundamental tests of QED in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Leptonic Flavor from Modular $A_4$: UV Mediators and SMEFT Realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of direct evidence for new physics at current collider energies motivates the study of indirect effects within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). In this work, we investigate the role of the $A_4$ discrete flavor symmetry in constraining the UV dynamics, giving rise to dimension-6 SMEFT operators involving leptons. We consider renormalizable interactions between SM fields and heavy mediators, classified according to their $A_4$ transformation properties in the modular framework, where Yukawa structures are encoded in modular forms. Restricting our analysis to UV interactions with at most a single modular form insertion, we study the resulting classification of $A_4$ UV mediator irreps and explore their implications across a range of observables, including both lepton-flavor-conserving and lepton-flavor-violating processes. A detailed phenomenological analysis is carried out, incorporating both tree-level and one-loop matching contributions for scalar and fermionic mediators, as well as leading-log RGE effects in case of vectors.</description>

      <title>On the gluon shadowing effect in light and heavy nuclei at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) gluon densities in nuclei. Our method is based on a combination of the color dipole scattering formalism, within which we interpret the nuclear deep inelastic structure functions $F_2^{A}(x, Q^2)$ and well established property of geometrical scaling from nucleons to nuclei. As an input, we employ the TMD gluon density in a proton which provides a self-consistent simultaneous description of the numerous HERA and LHC data on $pp$, $ep$ and $\gamma p$ processes. After fitting the relevant phenomenological parameters to the experimental data on the ratios $F_2^{A}(x, Q^2)/F_2^{A^\prime}(x, Q^2)$ for several nuclear targets $A$ and $A^\prime$, we derive the corresponding nuclear gluon distributions. Then, we make predictions for gluon shadowing effects at small Bjorken $x$ in their dependence of the mass number $A$. A comparison with other approaches is given.</description>

      <title>Probing low scale leptogenesis through gravitational wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for a common origin of neutrino mass and baryogenesis is one of the longstanding goals in particle physics. A minimal gauge extension of the Standard Model by $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry provides a unique scenario to explain the tiny mass of neutrinos as well as the observed baryon asymmetry, both by virtue of three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). Additionally, the $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ breaking scalar that generates mass of the RHNs can produce a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) via cosmological first-order phase transition. In this work, we systematically investigate TeV-scale leptogenesis considering flavor effects that are crucial in low temperature regime. We also explore all possible RHN production channels which can have significant impact on the abundance of RHNs, depending on the value of $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ gauge coupling. We demonstrate that the strong dependence of $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ gauge sector on the baryon asymmetry as well as SGWB production can be utilized to probe a region of the model parameter space. In particular, we find that $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ gauge boson with mass $\sim 10\,\rm TeV$ and gauge coupling $\sim 0.1$ can explain the observed baryon asymmetry and produces detectable SGWB in future detectors as well. Importantly, this region falls beyond the reach of the current collider sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of $D_{s1}$ mesons radiative transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss radiative transitions $D_{s1}\rightarrow D_s\gamma$ and $D_{s1}\rightarrow D_s^*\gamma$ of $p$-wave mesons. Since $D_{s1}$ mesons have no a certain $C$-parity, and the masses of quarks in these mesons differ significantly, then due to the spin-orbit interaction each of $p$-wave mesons with the total angular momentum $J=1$ is a superposition of states with the total spin of quarks $S_{tot}=0$ and $S_{tot}=1$. We explain why the partial width of $D_{s1}(2460)\to D_s\gamma$ radiative transition is significantly larger than the corresponding value for $D_{s1}(2536)\to D_s\gamma$. We also predict the corresponding partial widths of $B_{s1}$ and $B_{c1}$.</description>

      <title>Light dark-matter window in $K^+\to\pi^+$$+$$\not{\!\!E}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential presence of new physics in the recent NA62 observation of the kaon decay $K^+\to\pi^+$+$\not{\!\!E}$ with missing energy $\not{\!\!E}$ in the context of a dark-matter (DM) scenario that can explain the Belle II finding of enhanced rate of the $b$-meson decay \mbox{$B^+\to K^+$+$\not{\!\!E}$} compared to the standard-model expectation. Specifically, assuming that a light real scalar boson $\phi$ plays the role of DM and working in an effective field-theory-framework, we study model-independently the impact of operators involving $\phi$ and ordinary quarks on the aforementioned transitions over the kaon mode's kinematical mass region of $m_\phi &lt; (m_K - m_\pi)/2 = 177$ MeV. The DM particle is subject to significant restrictions from the observed relic abundance and from DM direct detection experiments incorporating the Migdal effect, indirect searches including that in cosmic microwave background data, and collider searches, except when its mass is between 110 MeV and 146 MeV. We demonstrate that $K^+\to\pi^+\phi\phi$ can saturate the new-physics window in the NA62 result if $m_\phi$ lies in the 110-130 MeV portion of the range left by the DM constraints. Improved data from future Belle II and NA62 measurements and DM quests will test our scenario more stringently.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar Higgs Production at Muon Colliders: The Role of One-Loop Effective Vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson $A$ at muon colliders within the framework of Type-II and Type-X Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) at the Next-to-Leading Order (NLO), utilizing an Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach. In particular, we analyze the level of enhancement to the cross section due to the inclusion of the one-loop corrections involving $\gamma$ and $Z$ boson fusion compared to the tree-level contribution. We find that for Type-II, including the effective vertices of $\gamma\gamma A$, $\gamma Z A$ and $ZZ A$, could lead to an enhancement of a factor of $\sim 2$ at low $m_A$ and low $\tan\beta$, whereas for Type-X, the enhancement could reach $\sim 10$ in the same regime. We also investigate the impact of the COM energy and $\tan \beta$ on the production cross section. We find that for the region of the parameter space not excluded by experiment, cross sections of $\gtrsim 1$ fb for Type-II, and $\gtrsim 5$ fb for Type-X, are possible, making the proposed muon collider a feasible alternative for probing the 2HDM extended Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>The Simplest Dark Matter Model at the Edge of Perturbativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly sensitive direct detection dark matter experiments are testing important regions of parameter space for WIMP dark matter and pushing many models to the multi-TeV regime. This brings into question the perturbativity of these models. In this context, and in light of the new limits from the LZ experiment, we investigate the status of the simplest thermal dark matter model: a singlet scalar, real or complex, coupled to the Higgs boson. We calculate the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the direct detection rates as well as for the annihilations driving thermal freeze-out. For the complex case, we find that the entire perturbative region is excluded by direct detection. For the real case we find that the mass should be $\gtrsim 20\,{\rm TeV}$ at NLO, compared with the $\gtrsim 30\,{\rm TeV}$ LO limit. We highlight that a three-fold improvement on WIMP spin independent interactions can fully test the real scalar model in the perturbative regime. Finally, for both models, there is still an allowed (albeit narrow) region near the Higgs resonance where couplings are perturbative.</description>

      <title>Rephasing invariants of CP violation for heavy and light Majorana neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the canonical seesaw mechanism, the strengths of charged-current interactions for light and heavy Majorana neutrinos are described respectively by the $3\times 3$ matrices $U$ and $R$ that are correlated with each other via the exact seesaw relation and the unitarity condition. We write out the Majorana-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$, which are insensitive to redefining the phases of three charged-lepton fields; and the Dirac-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$ that are insensitive to the rephasing of both the charged-lepton fields and the neutrino fields. Such invariants are explicitly calculated with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the seesaw flavor structure containing nine active-sterile flavor mixing angles and six independent CP-violating phases, and their corresponding roles in the CP-violating asymmetries of three heavy Majorana neutrino decays and in the flavor oscillations of three light Majorana neutrinos are briefly discussed. We point out that similar rephasing invariants arising from the interplay between $R$ and $U$ may also manifest themselves in a variety of lepton-flavor-violating and lepton-number-violating processes.</description>

      <title>The $\rho$-meson electromagnetic form factors within the light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $\rho$-meson electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) within the framework of light-front quark model (LFQM). The physical form factors $G_{C,M,Q}(Q^2)$ of $\rho$-meson as well as the charged square radius $\langle r^2\rangle$, the magnetic moment $\mu$ and the quadrupole moment $\bar Q$ are calculated, which describe the behaviors of EMFFs at zero momentum transfer. Using the type-II replacement, we find that the zero-mode does contribute zero to the matrix element $S_{00}^+$. It is found that the ``$M\to M_{0}$" replacement improves angular condition remarkably, which permits different prescriptions of $\rho$-meson EMFFs give the consistent results. The residue tiny violation of angular condition needs other explanations than the zero-mode contributions. Our results indicate that the relativistic effects or interaction internal structure are weaken in the zero-binding limit. This work is also applied for the other spin-1 particles.</description>

      <title>Scalar, Vector and Tensor Form Factors of Pion and Kaon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the possible scalar, vector, and tensor form factors (FFs) for pion and kaon in the light-cone quark model (LCQM). These FFs are calculated from the leading and sub-leading twist generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs) of the pion and kaon. The vector and tensor FFs correspond to twist-2 GPDs, whereas the scalar FFs correspond to twist-3 scalar GPDs. We calculate the FFs from the GPDs quark-quark correlator and express them in the form of light-front wave functions (LFWFs). The behavior of these FFs was found to be in sync with experimental data, other model predictions, and lattice simulation results. We have also calculated the charge radii corresponding to different FFs and compared them with other models, lattice simulation results, and experimental data. The scalar radii of the pion and kaon of our model are found to be $0.528$ and $0.409$ $fm$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Radiative tail of the three-particle light-cone distribution amplitudes for the $\Lambda_b$ baryon in HQET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the so-called radiative tail for the three-particle light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon, following from the short-distance expansion of the defining light-ray operators in heavy-quark effective theory (HQET). To illustrate the effect of the radiative tail, we introduce a simple (model-dependent) extrapolation to large distances (respectively small momenta), which preserves the analytic properties of the LCDAs in HQET. We observe a similar qualitative behaviour as has been discussed for the $B$-meson case.</description>

      <title>Role of the short-range dynamics in simultaneous interpretation of $P_{cs}$ pentaqurks via $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate hidden-charm molecular states in $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ systems using the one-boson exchange model. By regulating the short-range interactions with parameter $a$ and cutoff $\Lambda$, we found ten bound states in isoscalar systems. Our analysis reveals that if the LHCb's $P_{cs}(4459)$ and Belle's $P_{cs}(4472)$ pentaqurks are indeed distinct states, their mass splitting can be resolved through $\Xi_c\bar{D}^*$-$\Xi_{c}^{\prime}\bar{D}$ coupled-channel dynamics using consistent model parameters. This framework assigns $3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$ spin-parity quantum numbers to $P_{cs}(4459)$ and $P_{cs}(4472)$, respectively. With this consistent model parameter, we predict several new molecular candidates in the 4.3-4.7 GeV region, demonstrating the crucial interplay between coupled-channel effects and short-range dynamics in understanding hidden-charm pentaquarks as hadronic molecules.</description>

      <title>Neutrino magnetic moments: effective versus fundamental parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for neutrino magnetic moments offers a valuable window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, a common misconception arises in the interpretation of experimental results: the assumption that the so-called effective neutrino magnetic moment is a universal, experiment-independent quantity. In reality, this effective parameter depends on the specific characteristics of each experiment, including the neutrino source, flavor composition or energy spectrum. As a result, the effective magnetic moment derived from solar neutrino data differs fundamentally from that obtained in reactor or accelerator-based experiments. Treating these quantities as directly comparable can lead to misleading conclusions. In this work, we clarify the proper definition of the effective neutrino magnetic moment in various experimental contexts and discuss the implications of this misconception for global analyses and theoretical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Local equilibrium Wigner function for spin 1/2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal connections between the spin density matrix and the Wigner function for spin 1/2 particles are explored to determine their general structures. They suggest that the commonly used form of the local equilibrium Wigner function should be replaced by a new expression. The latter fulfills the necessary condition for the normalization of the mean spin polarization, which the former fails to reproduce. Moreover, the new form of the local equilibrium Wigner function leads to generalized thermodynamic relations for perfect spin hydrodynamics, which were found before in the approach using the classical concept of spin. The forms of the conserved tensors obtained with the new Wigner function agree with those obtained with the classical spin method up to the second order in the spin polarization tensor; however, they disagree, as expected, for large values of the mean polarization.</description>

      <title>Production of leptonium in heavy quarkonium decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lepton pair with opposite charges can form the bound state called ``leptonium'' with quantum electrodynamics interaction. The heavy quarkonium like $J/\psi$ can be massively produced at the BESIII and the future Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). We study the production of leptonium in heavy quarkonium decays, ${\cal{Q}} \longrightarrow (l_1^+ l_2^-)[n] +\gamma$ ($l_{1,2}= \tau,\, \mu,\, e$) and ${\cal{Q}} \longrightarrow (l_1^+ l_2^-)[n] + l_1^- l_2^+$, where ${\cal{Q}}$ is the heavy quarkonium $J/\psi$ or $\Upsilon$, $n=$ ${^1S_0}$ or $^3S_1$ refer to the para- and ortho-leptonium respectively. With the annual production of $3.4 \times 10^{12}$ $J/\psi$ events at STCF, it is very promising to make some observations on the positronium $(e^+e^-)$, the muonium $(\mu^+e^-)$, and the dimuonium $(\mu^+\mu^-)$. Specifically, the ortho-dimuonium $(\mu^+\mu^-)[^3S_1]$ might be discovered at future STCF with the inclusive branching fraction $Br(J/\psi \longrightarrow (\mu^+\mu^-)[^3S_1] +X) = 1.5 \times 10^{-12}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the formalism of coherent states in quantum optics to pomeron evolution and show that evolving squeezed pomeron states are equivalent to pomeron fan diagrams at the leading order of perturbative expansion. Based on our results, we interpret the action of the displacement operator as pomeron propagation and the action of the squeeze operator as pomeron interaction.</description>

      <title>Transverse single-spin asymmetries in $\gamma$SIDIS as a direct probe of quark-gluon-quark longitudinal momentum structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transverse single-spin asymmetries in the semi-inclusive deep-inelastic production of isolated photons ($\gamma$SIDIS), $A_{UT}^{\gamma {\rm SIDIS}}$, provide an unprecedented opportunity to extract the quark-gluon-quark correlators $F_{FT}(x,x')$ and $G_{FT}(x,x')$ point-by-point in their full support $x,x'$. We utilize realistic models for these functions, based on input from the Sivers transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function and imposing constraints from the $d_2$ matrix element calculated in lattice QCD, in order to provide numerical estimates for $A_{UT}^{\gamma {\rm SIDIS}}$ at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We thoroughly explore the EIC phase space in order to isolate in which regions the asymmetry can be sizable, finding it can be as much as $10\%$ or larger for certain kinematics. Given that $F_{FT}(x,x')$ and $G_{FT}(x,x')$ are basically unknown, $A_{UT}^{\gamma {\rm SIDIS}}$ will be an important future measurement to learn about multi-parton correlations in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Emergence of new heavy quarkoniumlike states: $Y(10600)$ and $Y(10650)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the existence of two novel bottomoniumlike states, $Y(10600)$ and $Y(10650)$, as either the $P$-wave $B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ bound state or resonance close to the $B\bar{B}^{*}$ and $B^{*}\bar{B}^{*}$ thresholds, respectively, which are dynamically generated in a coupled-channel framework and have quantum numbers $I(J^{PC})=0(1^{--})$. The first one $Y(10600)$ is identified as the hidden-bottom partner of the recently established charmoniumlike state $G(3900)$, the first candidate of P-wave dimeson resonance in the heavy flavor sector associated with the $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ scattering dynamics. We predict the line shapes of both $Y(10600)$ and $Y(10650)$ in the cross sections of open bottom processes $e^+e^- \to B\bar{B}^*$ and $e^+e^- \to B^*\bar{B}^*$, both of which exhibit a pronounced peak line shape, and we find that existing experimental data from BelleII show obvious indications of $Y(10650)$. These two new states closely mirror the behavior of $G(3900)$, as their predicted masses lie between the well-known $\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\Upsilon(5S)$, suggesting a manifestly exotic nature once they can be observed by the experiment. Therefore, the experimental search for these new bottomoniumlike states would provide critical evidence for a new class of exotic hadrons of the $P$-wave dimeson and would offer decisive insight into the $XYZ$ spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing dark matter with quantum scale symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of gauge-Yukawa theories with trans-Planckian asymptotic safety, quantum scale symmetry can prevent the appearance in the Lagrangian of couplings that would otherwise be allowed by the gauge symmetry. Such couplings correspond to irrelevant Gaussian fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Their absence in the theory implies that different sectors of the gauge-Yukawa theory are secluded from one another, in similar fashion to the effects of a global or a discrete symmetry. As an example, we impose the trans-Planckian scale symmetry on a model of Grand Unification based on the gauge group SU(6), showing that it leads to the emergence of several fermionic WIMP dark matter candidates whose coupling strengths are entirely predicted by the UV completion.</description>

      <title>Exploring minimal two component doublet dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two-component dark matter (DM) scenario by extending the Standard Model with two additional $SU(2)_L$ doublets, one scalar, and another fermion. To ensure the stability of the DM components, we impose a global $Z_2 \times Z_2^\prime$ symmetry. The lightest neutral states for both the scalar and fermion, which are non-trivially transformed under the extended symmetry, behave as stable two-component DM candidates. While single components are under-abundant due to their gauge interactions, in a mass region between $m_W$ and $525$ GeV for the scalar and a mass below $1200$ GeV for the fermion, and the fermion DM conflicts with direct detection limits over the whole parameter space, having two components helps to saturate relic density in the regions with under-abundance. Compliance with direct detection constraints leads to two options, either introducing dim-5 effective operators, or embedding the scenarios into a complete UV theory, which reproduces a type-II seesaw model, thus naturally including neutrino masses. We analyze the consequences of this scenario at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Scientific Spirit of Chien-Shiung Wu: From Quantum Entanglement to Parity Nonconservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1950, Chien-Shiung Wu and her student published a coincidence experiment on entangled photon pairs that were created in electron-positron annihilation. This experiment precisely verified the prediction of quantum electrodynamics. Additionally, it was also the first instance of a precisely controlled quantum entangled state of spatially separated particles, although Wu did not know about this at the time. In 1956, Wu initiated and led the so-called Wu experiment, which discovered parity nonconservation, becoming one of the greatest experiments of the 20th century. As Chen Ning Yang said, Wu's experiments were well known for their precision and accuracy. Experimental precision and accuracy manifested Wu's scientific spirit, which we investigate here in some detail. This paper is the translated transcript of the speech the author made at the International Symposium Commemorating the 110th Anniversary of the Birth of Chien-Shiung Wu, on May 31, 2022. The above abstract is the translation of the original abstract of the speech.</description>

      <title>Higher order flow coefficients -- A Messenger of QCD medium formed in heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic flow and fluctuations are sensitive observables to the initial state effects in heavy ion collisions and are characterized by the medium properties and final state interactions. Using event-shape observables, one can constrain the probability distributions of anisotropic flow coefficients, thus reducing the linear and nonlinear contributions in the measured higher-order harmonics. In this paper, we use transverse spherocity as an event shape observable to study the flow coefficients and elliptic flow fluctuations. Transverse spherocity is found to have a strong correlation with elliptic flow and its fluctuations. We exploit this feature of transverse spherocity to remove the contribution of elliptic flow from higher-order harmonics. The study is performed in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using a multi-phase transport model. The multi-particle Q-cumulant method estimates the anisotropic flow coefficients, which reduces the non-flow contributions. We observe a stronger system response to the flow coefficients for the events with smaller values of elliptic flow.</description>

      <title>Exploring amplitude criteria for weak gravity in electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connections between weak gravity conjecture (WGC) bounds and scattering positivity have been extensively studied over the past decade. This work further explores these connections by proposing positivity as a potential amplitude criterion for weak gravity, with the aim of unifying various weak gravity bounds within a single framework. We illustrate this criterion by analyzing two-body elastic scatterings of photons and Higgs bosons in the forward limit of an electroweak (EW)-like theory. This leads to an amplitude-based criterion that extends magnetic WGC-type bounds to include not only the Abelian gauge coupling but also the non-Abelian gauge and the Yukawa coupling. Furthermore, a version of the species bound naturally emerges within this setup, suggesting that this amplitude criterion may extend to broader Swampland conjectures beyond the WGC.</description>

      <title>The Sun's Dark Core: Helioseismic and neutrino flux constraints on a compact solar center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As dark matter appears to comprise most of the Galactic mass, some of it may accumulate in the cores of stars, thereby making the Sun a laboratory for constraining various dark matter theories. We consider the effects on the solar structure arising from a general class of macroscopic dark matter candidates that include strange quark matter, compact dark objects, and others. We calibrate standard solar evolution models (i.e., models that reproduce the mass, luminosity, radius, and metallicity of the Sun at its present age) with variable compact dark core masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-2}~\rm{M}_\odot$ and assess their properties.
  We find that the weakest constraints come from solar neutrino flux measurements, which only rule out the most massive dark core comprising at least $\sim 1\%$ of the total solar mass. The Sun's acoustic oscillations impose stronger constraints, probing masses down to $\sim 10^{-5}~\rm{M}_\odot$. We find that a model with a $10^{-3}~\rm{M}_\odot$ dark core appears to improve the agreement with helioseismic observations. We nevertheless caution against interpreting this as evidence for dark matter in the solar interior, and suggest plausible effects that the dark core may instead be emulating. Finally, we show that future measurements of solar $g$~modes may constrain dark core masses down to $10^{-7}~\rm{M}_\odot$.</description>

      <title>ACT DR6 Insights on the Inflationary Attractor models and Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the observational constraints on $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models and their post-inflationary reheating dynamics in light of the latest CMB data from ACT DR6 combined with Planck18, BICEP/$Keck$ 2018, and DESI (collectively denoted P-ACT-LB-BK18). Focusing on both E and T type attractor potentials, we analyze how inflationary observables namely the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are indirectly influenced by reheating parameters such as the reheating temperature $T_{\text{RH}}$, the inflaton equation-of-state $w_\phi$, and the inflaton's couplings to Starndard Model particles. We incorporate indirect constraints from the overproduction of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), particularly via $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds on BBN, which become significant for stiff post-inflationary dynamics. Our results show that E-models permit a wide range of reheating scenarios, including matter-like reheating ($w_\phi = 0$), while T-models are viable only for $w_\phi \gtrsim 0.44$. We derive bounds on inflaton-Standard Model couplings for both decay and scattering channels and identify parameter regimes compatible with recent ACT data for successful reheating. These findings establish a robust connection between inflationary theory, thermal history, and particle phenomenology, and provide predictive targets for future CMB missions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Quantization of Gauge Field Theories: Sandwich Quantization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization of field theories with gauge symmetry is an extensively discussed and well-established topic. In this short note, we revisit this old problem. The gauge degrees of freedom have vanishing momenta, and hence their equations of motion appear as constraints on the system. We argue that to ensure consistency of quantization one can impose these constraints as "sandwich conditions": The physical Hilbert space of the theory consists of all states for which the constraints sandwiched between any two physical states vanish. We solve the sandwich constraints and show they have solutions not discussed in the gauge field theory literature. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of these solutions and implications of the "sandwich quantization scheme".</description>

      <title>On the momentum of gluons in Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attempts to improve LGT simulation algorithms by Fourier space preconditioning have been handicapped by the gauge dependence of momenta, familiar from perturbation theory. The continuum theory has a gauge invariant energy-momentum density, indicating this to be a fake obstacle. While perturbation-theory momenta are evidently wrong for the task, momentum-transfer carried by gluons is physical. Simulations using these momenta may become practical in the near future thanks to recent progress in generative models, stochastic and/or deterministic.</description>

      <title>Realization of all-to-all fermion propagator for the first principle high accuracy strong interaction prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a ``blending" algorithm that projects the all-to-all fermion propagator onto spatial low-frequency modes (LFM) combined with a stochastic estimate of spatial high-frequency modes (SHFM) at each time slice. This approach enables the calculation of arbitrary-point correlation functions for arbitrary hadron states in strongly interacting quantum field theories (QFT) with fermions, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, LFM allows the construction of spatially extended hadron states below a certain energy threshold by diagonalizing multi-fermion interpolation fields. Meanwhile, the local interactions required for N-point correlation functions in QFT can be approximated in an unbiased manner through a reweighted summation of both LFM and SHFM contributions. To demonstrate the efficiency of this algorithm, we obtained {\color{black} $g_A^u=0.895(15)$, $g_A^d=-0.338(15)$, $g_A^s=-0.0245(72)$, $g_A^{u+d+s}=0.533(28)$ and $g_A^{u-d}=1.2339(43)$ } for nucleon at $m_{\pi}=300$ MeV and $a=0.077$ fm using 40 configurations. The consistency check of the pion electric form factor and charge radius derived from 3-point and 4-point correlation functions is also provided.</description>

      <title>Generalized susceptibilities and the properties of charm degrees of freedom across the QCD crossover temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized charm susceptibilities in 2+1 flavor QCD on the lattice at several lattice spacings. We show that, below the chiral crossover, these susceptibilities are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model if charmed hadrons not listed in tables of the Particle Data Group are included. However, the HRG description abruptly breaks down just above the chiral crossover. To understand this, we use a model for the charm pressure in which it is expressed as the sum of partial pressures from charmed baryons, charmed mesons, and charm quarks. We present continuum estimates of these partial pressures and find that, while the partial pressures of charmed mesons and baryons drop below their respective HRG predictions, the charm quark pressure becomes non-zero above the chiral crossover.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly from (anomalous) spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the low energy fluctuations of spinning black Dp branes are described by a theory of spin hydrodynamics on a spacetime $\mathbb{M}_{p+1}\times \mathbb{T}^{n+2}$ in which the fluid is flowing on $\mathbb{M}_{p+1}$ and spinning on $\mathbb{T}^{n+2}$. Focusing on the hydrodynamic regime of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, we provide a geometric interpretation of the R-current anomaly in terms of a gravitational anomaly from the ten-dimensional point of view. This follows from the holographic duality between a spinning fluid in ten dimensions and an anomalous chiral fluid in four dimensions. We comment on the relations between the theory of spin hydrodynamics introduced here and other theories of spin hydrodynamics in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Dirac Singleton as a Relativistic Field Beyond Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new interpretation of Dirac singletons \cite{Dirac:1963ta}, i.e. free conformal fields in $d$ dimensions, as relativistic fields in a $d+1$-dimensional space-time with cosmological constant, that differs from the Flato-Fronsdal dipole construction in $AdS_{d+1}$ \cite{Flato:1986uh}, is proposed. The $d+1$-dimensional field is described at the level of both equations and Lagrangian. It forms an infinite-dimensional representation of the $d+1$-dimensional Lorentz group that relates fields at different space-time points. The associated well-known fact is that singleton cannot be localized at a point in ${d+1}$ dimensions, hence being unobservable via local scattering/radiation phenomena in the Standard Model ($d=3$). On the other hand, that singleton respects ${d+1}$ dimensional relativistic symmetries makes it possible to introduce its interactions with gravity and other relativistic fields in $d+1$ dimensions. It is speculated that the presence of singleton in a four-dimensional field theory with non-zero cosmological constant (dark energy) can be relevant to the dark matter phenomenon and baryon asymmetry generation.</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi Equations and Coexistence of Vortices and Antivortices in Generalized Abelian Higgs Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the Bogomol'nyi equations in generalized Abelian Higgs theories which allow the coexistence of vortices and antivortices over a compact Riemann surface or the full plane. In the compact surface situation, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique solution describing a system of coexisting vortices and antivortices. In the full-plane situation, we prove the existence of a unique solution representing an arbitrary distribution of vortices and antivortices and obtain sharp asymptotic behavior of the solution near infinity. These solutions carry quantized magnetic fluxes and energies explicitly expressed in terms of the numbers of vortices and antivortices topologically characterized by the first Chern and Thom classes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic analysis of finite-temperature effects on cosmological parameters by artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of finite-temperature quantum gravity effects on cosmological parameters, particularly the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, by incorporating temperature-dependent quantum corrections into the Hubble parameter. For that purpose, we modify the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System. We introduce new density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, arising from finite-temperature quantum gravity contributions, and analyze their influence on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum using advanced machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks and stochastic optimization. Our results reveal that $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ assumes a negative value, consistent with dimensional regularization in renormalization and that the presence of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ as well as $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ significantly enhances model accuracy. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the inclusion of these parameters improves the fit to 2018 Planck data, suggesting that finite-temperature quantum gravity effects play a non-negligible role in cosmological evolution. Although the Hubble tension persists, our findings highlight the potential of quantum gravitational corrections in refining cosmological models and motivate further investigation into higher-order thermal effects and polarization data constraints.</description>

      <title>Jet shape modification in a transport calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise quantification of the medium-modification of the high transverse momenta jets in relativistic heavy ion collisions rely on consistent modelling of elastic and inelastic energy loss suffered by the jet and the concurrent underlying medium evolution. We have developed a unified framework for jet and bulk medium evolution within a multiphase transport approach where the jets and medium share energy and momentum via multiple elastic scatterings and medium-induced gluon radiation during the parton transport. The formulation enables realistic predictions of jet based observables extended to a large radius of the jet cone in central Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. The model provides reasonable quantitative agreement with the experimental data from inclusive jet suppression and the full jet shape function up to large radial distances induced by both the collisional and radiative jet energy loss and migration of the lost $p_T$ in the medium. We find that gradual degradation of jet energy through gluon emissions alters the energy-momentum evolution in the jet, essential to describe the entire range of jet shape ratio relative to proton-proton collisions. Pure collisional energy loss injects appreciable $p_T$ broadening and migration of the medium partons, resulting in an enhanced population at large angular distances in the jet-shape ratio.</description>

      <title>Constraining the neutron star equation of state by including the isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling using the Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the nuclear matter equation of state within the relativistic mean field model by including the isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling term at a fundamental level using the Bayesian analysis. We used the nuclear saturation properties and recent astrophysical observations to constrain the dense matter equation of state. We obtained about 20000 sets of equations of states out of sampling about 60 millions sets of equations of states. All 20000 equations of states satisfy nuclear matter saturation properties at saturation densities and produces high mass neutron stars. In our findings, we find that the non-zero value of isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling parameter and negative value of sigma meson self-coupling stiffen the equation of state. Our sets of equations of state produces neutron stars of mass larger than 2.5 M$_{\odot}$ to include the recent gravitational waves observation GW190419.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the fundamental idea that there may be a role for the Casimir effect, via an uncertainty relation, in the generation of electron-positron and quark-gluon plasmas. We investigate this concept, reviewing the possible contribution of semi-classical electrodynamics to nuclear interactions, specifically focusing on the Casimir effect at sub-Fermi length scales. The main result is a temperature distance relation, derived from the time-energy uncertainty relation, which can have observable consequences at these extreme scales. From a more general perspective, since the energy-time uncertainty relation appears to be a significant physical quantity, we also provide a brief overview of recent developments in this direction in Sec. 3.2.</description>

Abstract: We show that the latest empirical constraints on cosmology from a combination of DESI, CMB and supernova data, can be accounted for if a small component of dark matter has an evolving and oscillating equation of state within $-1&lt;w&lt;1$. From a fundamental physics perspective, this interpretation is more appealing than an evolving phantom dark energy with $w&lt;-1$, which violates the null energy condition.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches parametrize the interactions and dynamics of two and more hadrons and their response to different electroweak probes. The inclusion of unitarity, three-body channels, and other properties from scattering theory allows for a reliable extraction of resonance spectra and their properties from data. We review the formalism and application of the ANL-Osaka, the Juelich-Bonn-Washington, and other DCC approaches in the context of light baryon resonances from meson, (virtual) photon, and neutrino-induced reactions, as well as production reactions, strange baryons, light mesons, heavy meson systems, exotics, and baryon-baryon interactions. Finally, we also provide a connection of the formalism to study finite-volume spectra obtained in Lattice QCD, and review applications involving modern statistical and machine learning tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the dimension-8 standard-model effective theory (SMEFT) contact terms relevant for vector-pair production at the LHC and lepton colliders. We first list the relevant dimension-8 massless SMEFT amplitudes, and then obtain the low-energy amplitudes using on-shell Higgsing. In all cases, the contributions we calculate are the leading-order contributions to 4-point contact-terms; the dimension-6 SMEFT merely corrects the three-point couplings entering the amplitudes. Since they are given in terms of physical quantities, namely momenta and polarizations, the results allow for a direct mapping of EFT effects to low-energy observables. The vector amplitudes are sensitive to both anomalous vector couplings and Higgs self-couplings. The left-handed fermion amplitudes feature SU(2) violating effects first generated at dimension-8. We also compare our results to HEFT predictions. Interestingly, the dimension-8 SMEFT populates almost all the novel structures generated by the dimension-8 HEFT.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we have investigated the radiative and semileptonic decay of doubly heavy baryons. Our focus is to determine the static and dynamic properties such as ground state masses, magnetic moment, transition magnetic moment, radiative decay and heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay rates including their corresponding branching fractions. The ground state masses are calculated by solving the six-dimensional hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The magnetic moments and transition magnetic moments for $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+$ and $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$ baryons are also calculated. In addition, radiative M1 decay widths are computed from the transition magnetic moment. We have employed the Isgur-Wise function(IWF) to analyse the semileptonic decay widths of the doubly heavy baryons. The obtained results are compared with other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We attempt to apply the Regge trajectory approach to the triply heavy triquarks $((QQ')\bar{Q}^{\prime\prime})$ $(Q,\,Q',\,Q^{\prime\prime}=b,\,c)$. We present the triquark Regge trajectory relations, and then employ them to crudely estimate the spectra of the triquarks $((cc)\bar{c})$, $((cc)\bar{b})$, $((bc)\bar{c})$, $((bc)\bar{b})$, $((bb)\bar{c})$, and $((bb)\bar{b})$. The $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are discussed. The triquark Regge trajectory becomes a new and very simple approach for estimating the spectra of triquarks. Moreover, the spin-averaged masses of the ground states of pentaquarks $(\bar{c}(cc))(cc)$, $(\bar{b}(cc))(cc)$ and $(\bar{c}(bb))(cc)$ are estimated, which are consistent with other theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: Within a scotogenic neutrino mass model we explore the cogenesis of matter from the CP violating decay of a heavy $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd right handed neutrino that simultaneously populates the visible and a multipartite dark sector. The quantum of CP violation sets the baryon asymmetry in the visible sector driven by leptogenesis. The relic density of a sub-GeV scale freeze-in dark matter is generated by the late time decay of the next to lightest dark particle dynamically regulated by its interplay with the thermal scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in the High-Scale Seesaw Leptogenesis Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The seesaw mechanism with three heavy Majorana right-handed neutrinos provides an elegant explanation for neutrino masses and, combined with leptogenesis, can generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). Naturally embedded in a Grand Unified Theory, this framework stands as one of the best-motivated extensions beyond the Standard Model, but it is very difficult to test it. Moreover, it does not account for dark matter (DM). In this paper, we propose a minimal extension that introduces a dark sector with a singlet Majorana fermion (as the DM candidate) and a complex scalar singlet. The heavy right-handed neutrinos serve another role beyond generating neutrino masses and the BAU: producing the cold DM density through their decays. Interestingly, the model also predicts a subdominant DM component from late scalar decays, which in some cases may be hot or warm at the onset of structure formation, as well as an equal number of non-thermal neutrinos. These components leave distinct signatures in various cosmological observables. Furthermore, electromagnetic energy injection from scalar decays alter predictions from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and induce spectral distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background black-body spectrum. In this context, upcoming experiments, such as the Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE), could probe the mechanism of neutrino mass generation.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Seebeck effect of the QGP medium using a novel relaxation time approximation model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highly energetic particle medium formed in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision displays a notable difference in the temperatures between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient can generate an electric field within the medium, a phenomenon referred to as the Seebeck effect. We have estimated the Seebeck coefficient for a dense quark-gluon plasma medium by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model within the kinetic theory framework. This study explores the Seebeck coefficient of individual quark flavors as well as the entire partonic medium. Our observation indicates that, for given current quark masses, the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the partonic medium decreases as the temperature rises and increases as the chemical potential increases. Furthermore, we have investigated the Seebeck effect by considering the partonic interactions within the quasiparticle model. In addition, we have presented a comparison between our findings and the results of the standard RTA model. We have observed that the Seebeck coefficient of the QGP medium gets conspicuously decreased in the novel RTA model as compared to that in the standard RTA model. A decreased Seebeck coefficient in the novel RTA model describes a smaller magnitude of induced electric field in the medium than that estimated by the standard RTA model. However, the rate of decline gets gradually smaller as the medium gets hotter for both the current quark mass scenario and the quasiparticle mass scenario. It is also found that, in the noninteracting case, the Seebeck coefficient possesses a slightly negative value in the high temperature region, unlike the quasiparticle description, where the Seebeck coefficient remains positive for the entire temperature range.</description>

      <title>Individual Neutrino Masses From a Supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nearby supernova will carry an unprecedented wealth of information about astrophysics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. Because supernova are fundamentally neutrino driven phenomenon, our knowledge about neutrinos -- particles that remain quite elusive -- will increase dramatically with such a detection. One of the biggest open questions in particle physics is related to the masses of neutrinos. Here we show how a galactic supernova provides information about the masses of each of the three mass eigenstates \emph{individually}, at some precision, and is well probed at JUNO. This information comes from several effects including time delay and the MSW effect within the supernova. The time delay feature is strongest during a sharp change in the flux such as the neutronization burst; additional information may also come from a QCD phase transition in the supernova or if the supernova forms a black hole. We consider both standard cases as dictated by local oscillation experiments as well as new physics motivated scenarios where neutrino masses may differ across the galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Our understanding of high-lying states within the charmonium family remains incomplete, particularly in light of recent observations of charmonium states at energies around 4 GeV. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic properties of several high-lying charmonia, focusing on the $2D$ and $1F$ states. A mass spectrum analysis is conducted, incorporating the unquenched effects. We then present a detailed study of the strong decay properties, including partial decay widths for two-body strong decays permitted by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule. Additionally, we explore the primary radiative decay channels associated with these states. Finally, we discuss the productions of the $2D$ and $1F$ states via $B$-meson decay and $e^+e^-$ annihilation Theoretical predictions provided here aim to guide future experimental searches for high-lying charmonium states, particularly at BESIII, Belle II, LHCb and future facility STCF.</description>

      <title>Detecting dilute axion stars constrained by fast radio bursts in the solar system via stimulated decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be explained by collapsing axion stars, imposing constraints on the axion parameter space and providing valuable guidance for experimental axion searches. In the traditional post-inflationary model, axion stars could constitute up to $75\%$ of the dark matter component, suggesting that some axion stars may exist within the solar system. Photons with energy half the axion mass can stimulate axion decay. Thus, directing a powerful radio beam at an axion star could trigger its stimulated decay, producing a detectable echo. Using this method, we find it is possible to test the existence of dilute axion stars with maximum masses ranging from $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$, as constrained by FRBs, within the solar system. The resulting echo from axion stars constrained by FRBs could be detectable by terrestrial telescopes. Detecting such an echo would confirm the existence of axion stars, unravel the mystery of dark matter, and provide key evidence that some FRBs originate from collapsing axion stars. Furthermore, FRBs produced by axion star collapses could serve as standard candles, aiding in the resolution of the Hubble tension. If no echo is detected using this method, it would place constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the form of dilute axion stars with maximum masses in the range of $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR bounds on radiatively decaying particles from M82</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions and other putative feebly interacting particles (FIPs) with a mass of tens to several hundreds of keVs can be produced in stellar cores with a Lorentz boost factor $E_a/m_a\lesssim 10$. Thus, starburst galaxies such as M82 are efficient factories of slow axions. Their decay $a\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ would produce a large flux of X-ray photons, peaking around $100$ keV and spread around the galaxy by an angle that can be relatively large. We use observations of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission to show that the absence of these features can constrain $30-500$ keV axion masses into uncharted regions for axion-photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-12}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. Our argument can be applied to other heavy FIPs and astrophysical sources that are hot enough to produce them, yet cold enough to avoid large boost factors which slow down the decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within a phenomenological diquark fragmentation model, we study the production of doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ via photon-photon fusion at electron-positron colliders. The production of $T_{cc}$ is divided into two steps: the perturbative production of heavy $(cc)$-diquark and its nonperturbative hadronization. Two diquark configurations of $(cc)[^3S_1]_{\bar{3}}$ and $(cc)[^1S_0]_{6}$ are considered, and the $(cc)[^3S_1]_{\bar{3}}$ state dominates the produciotn of $T_{cc}$. We discuss two hadronization models of $(cc)[^3S_1]_{\bar{3}}$ intermediate state into the tetraquark $T_{cc}$. It is found that it is promising to observe the tetraquark $T_{cc}$ via photon-photon fusion process both at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). We find that the cross sections are sensitive to constituent charm quark mass of diquark, and they also have strong dependence on the hadronization models.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions is investigated with the Functional Renormalization Group. We use a functional formulation with covariant gauge fixing and derive Renormalization Group flow equations for the gauge coupling, quark mass and an algebraically complete set of local fermion-fermion interaction vertices. The flow, based on a convenient Callan-Symanzik-type regularization, shows the expected behavior for a super-renormalizable theory in the ultraviolet regime and leads to a strongly coupled regime in the infrared. Through a detailed discussion of symmetry implications, and variations in the gauge group and flavor numbers, the analysis sets the stage for a more detailed investigation of the bound state spectrum in future work.</description>

Abstract: We study the deuteron gravitational form factors (GFFs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) within the soft-wall AdS/QCD model, where deuteron is described by the bulk vector field with twist $\tau=6$. For the finite-temperature studies, we apply the soft-wall model, which is thermalized by introducing a thermal dilaton field. GPDs and charge density are considered in impact parameter (IP) space and at zero and finite temperatures. We plot the temperature dependence of these quantities in IP space and observe a decreasing of their peaks on temperature increasing. The gravitational root means squared radius obtained here is close to the range given by experimental data for the mass radius and has low sensitivity to the temperature.</description>

Abstract: Prompted by several potential tetraquark states that have been reported by the LHCb, CMS and ATLAS collaborations in the di-$J/\Psi$ and $J/\Psi \Psi(2S)$ spectra, we investigate their contribution to two-photon processes. Within a non-relativistic potential model for the all-charm tetraquark states, we calculate the two-photon decay widths of these states, and test model independent sum rule predictions. Imposing such sum rule constraints allows us to predict the light-by-light scattering cross sections in a consistent way and check if any excess, in comparison to the Standard Model prediction, as reported by ongoing ATLAS experiments can be attributed to intermediate exotic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the neutrino mass generation and the dark matter stability can be governed by the center of the QCD group, which is a $Z_3$ group. Three right-handed neutrinos $N_{1,2,3R}$ transform under $Z_3$ as $1,w,w^2$, where $w=e^{i2\pi/3}$ is the cube root of unity, and they couple to usual lepton doublets via the usual Higgs doublet $H$ and two new scalar doublets $\eta,\chi$, which transform under $Z_3$ as $1,w^2,w$, respectively. This leads to a scotoseesaw mechanism in which the seesaw and scotogenic neutrino mass generations are induced by the Majorana $N_{1R}$ mass and the Dirac $N_{2,3R}$ mass, respectively. Although the lightest of the $Z_3$ fields is stabilized, responsible for dark matter, the model lacks an explanation for relic density and/or direct detection. The issue can be solved in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge completion of the model, for which the center of the QCD group is isomorphic to $Z_3=\{1,T,T^2\}$ for $T=w^{3(B-L)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory, we analyze the long-range rapidity correlations in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. As expected, the long-range rapidity correlations rebound after bottoming, which is successfully reproduced by the CGC. It is also found that the correlation rebound appears around the sum of the saturation momenta of the projectile and target, and moves to larger rapidities at higher collision energies. Beyond that, different trends in long-range rapidity correlations are observed between symmetric and asymmetric systems when the transverse momenta of two particles differ. The correlations are asymmetric in p-Pb collisions but absent in pp collisions. The asymmetry in rapidity correlations, exclusive to asymmetric pA collisions, directly results from the saturation and the quantum evolution of gluons within the framework of the CGC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is the cornerstone of relativity theory. Its implications have been verified experimentally with a variety of approaches. The detection of a muon at extremely high energy detected by the ARCA detector in the Mediterranean sea, the most energetic particle directly measured up to date, allows to put additional constraints on Lorentz non-invariant theories. The prediction of some of those theories is that the lifetimes of particles in the laboratory frame 'decrease' rather than 'increase' with increasing $\gamma$. In this frame the sheer fact that the muon traversed the whole ARCA detector puts a lower limit on the muon lifetime in the laboratory frame, that implies upper limits on Lorentz violating parameters.</description>

Abstract: The search for baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decay provides an intriguing probe of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Future neutrino experiments will improve the sensitivity to BNV nucleon decays and can serve to search for dark particles. In this work, we study the sterile neutrino effective field theories (EFTs) with baryon number violation and the impact of light sterile neutrino on BNV nucleon decays. We revisit the dimension-6 and dimension-7 EFT operator bases with $|\Delta (B-L)|=2$ or $|\Delta (B-L)|=0$. They are then matched to the baryon chiral perturbation theory. We obtain the effective chiral Lagrangian at low energies and the BNV interactions between the sterile neutrino and baryons and mesons. The rates of nucleon decay to SM neutrinos or a sterile neutrino are calculated. We then show the constraints on the ultraviolet scale from nucleon decay search at Super-K. The correlation of two EFT operators and the dependence on the sterile neutrino mass are also investigated.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the mechanical properties of the proton by extracting its flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors (GFFs) using Light-Cone QCD sum rules (LCSR). These form factors encode critical information about the internal dynamics and spatial distribution of energy, momentum, and internal forces within the proton. The flavor decomposition of the quark sector indicates the role of each flavor in the proton's pressure and shear force distributions. Our results show that the up quark contributes more significantly compared to the down quark in the three conserved proton GFFs, as well as in the energy and shear force distributions. Additionally, we define the non-conserved form factor $\bar{c}^q (t)$, which takes part in the distributions of energy and pressure; the latter is essential for maintaining proton stability. Furthermore, we determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii, providing valuable insight into its internal structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Because of the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width approximately proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</description>

      <title>Gradient corrections to the local-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor in the Zubarev approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a real scalar field in an approximation which accounts for space-time gradients of the hydrodynamical variables in local thermodynamical equilibrium. We show that the energy-momentum tensor receives corrections with respect to the standard local-equilibrium result. Notably, the relation between the energy density and pressure, i.e., the equation of state, is modified with respect to the one in global equilibrium. The obtained corrections might be relevant for systems created in relativistic hadron and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Background-Enhanced Axion Force by Axion Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of axion dark matter as a background on the spin-independent axion forces between nucleons. Notably, we find that the potential for axion forces scales from $1/r^3$ in a vacuum-only context to $1/r$ when the background effect is considered. Also, the magnitude of the axion force is substantially amplified in proportion to the number density of axion DM particles. These enhancements significantly improve the constraints on the axion decay constant by several orders of magnitude, across a broad range of axion masses, based on the fifth-force experiments such as the Casimir-less and torsion balance tests. This suggests that such experiments are more effective than previously understood in detecting axions.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Violation: Loop-Induced Effects in QED and Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is a cornerstone of modern physics, yet its possible violation remains both theoretically intriguing and experimentally significant. In this work, using quantum electrodynamics as an example, we explore how Lorentz invariance violation, introduced into a specific sector of the theory, spreads through loop corrections, modifying the propagation and dispersion relations of other particles. Self-energy and vacuum polarization graphs reveal how LIV effects transfer across sectors, influencing particle kinematics. Due to these loop effects, constraints from cosmic-ray observations and other Earth-based experiments impose limits on induced LIV parameters that would otherwise be less constrained. We show that while interaction-based LIV effects require unrealistically large parameters for detection, modifications to dispersion relations can be probed down to $\delta \sim 10^{-8} \text{ to } 10^{-9}$ at the LHC. This suggests that accelerator-based resonance studies provide a promising avenue for stringent LIV constraints, potentially rivaling astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as seen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude weaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and gamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even in such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical models typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some fine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark matter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays, inducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering cross section in the range $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma}/m_{\rm DM} \simeq 10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled with IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that achieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary constraints.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Recent Progress in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of entanglement island in the Karch-Randall braneworld, it has been conjectured and proven in general that entanglement island is not consistent with long-range (massless) gravity. In this paper, we provide a careful check of this conclusion in a model of massless gravity that is constructed using the Karch-Randall braneworld. We show that there is indeed no entanglement island and hence not a nontrivial Page curve due to the diffeomorphism invariance if we are studying the correct question which is though subtle. Moreover, we show that this conclusion is not affected by deforming the setup with the Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) terms. Furthermore, we show that the consistency of holography in this model will provide nontrivial constraints to the DGP parameters. This study provides an example that causality and holography in anti-de Sitter space can be used to constrain low energy effective theories. At the end, we clarify several subtleties in the braneworld gravity which are overlooked in the literature and we discuss the robustness of the above results against possible coarse-graining protocols to define a subregion in a gravitational theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze Planck scale induced modifications of the relativistic time dilation using data from the Muon Storage Ring experiment at CERN. By examining the lifetimes of muons, we establish, for the first time, a constraint on such quantum gravity-inspired deformations using this channel. The magnitude of the effect indicates that the study of cosmic rays is a well suited arena for this scenario. We show, that the spectrum of muons would be significantly affected for particles at the PeV scale. Since this later observation of the effect of time dilation is more indirect compared to a direct lifetime measurement, we encourage to perform a high precision measurement of the muon lifetime as a function of the muon's energy.</description>

      <title>Electron scattering cross section for light nuclei within the unified electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06407v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the multipole expansion within the unified electroweak theory to develop a complete calculation method of the electron scattering cross section for light nuclei. The specific calculations for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the incident electron energy does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The obtained scattering cross sections corresponding to an appropriate adjustment of the harmonic oscillator parameter along with the V-A structure interpret reasonably well the available experimental data at MeV energies and provide predictive information at GeV energies. This gives new perspectives in studying the structure of nuclei and the weak interactions via electron or lepton scattering at high (GeV) energies, considering nuclei rather than quarks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rationale-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning for Jet Discrimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, particle jet tagging plays a pivotal role in distinguishing quark from gluon jets using data from collider experiments. While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New insights from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, in conjunction with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the combined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the parameter $c &gt; 1$ and the dark-energy equation of state $w$ does not cross $-1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally falls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the HDE model, the parameter $c &lt; 1$ and $w$ crosses $-1$ at a level beyond $10\sigma$. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of $w$ crossing $-1$ is considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction within the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip conundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are statistically as viable as the $\Lambda$CDM model when assessing Bayesian evidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data. However, when CMB data are added, the HDE and IHDE models are significantly less favored compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings advocate for further exploration of the HDE and IHDE models using forthcoming, more precise late-universe observations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Strong Interaction origin of Baryon Masses with Lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both the Higgs mechanism and strong interactions contribute to the masses of visible matter, yet how the six Higgs-generated quark masses and uniform strong interaction strength determine the hundreds of hadron masses remains unclear. Additionally, the role of massless, flavor-neutral gluons on hadron mass formation is central to the unresolved Millennium Prize problem on the mass gap in Yang-Mills theory. Addressing these questions requires advanced simulations on state-of-the-art supercomputers using Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which offers a rigorous, non-perturbative definition of QCD solvable numerically. Here we present first-principles lattice QCD calculations using comprehensive gauge ensembles that accurately predict ground state spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryon masses with light, strange, and charm quarks within 1\% of experimental values. At the \(\overline{\mathrm{MS}}\) 2 GeV scale, our results unveil two fundamental mass generation mechanisms for those baryon masses in QCD: 1) the flavor-dependent enhancement of Higgs contributions, 4-8 for light, 2-3 for strange, and 1.2-1.3 for charm quarks; and 2) the flavor-insensitive contribution 0.8-1.2 GeV from gluon quantum anomaly. This breakthrough significantly advances our comprehension of strong interaction dynamics and the genesis of visible matter's mass.</description>

      <title>PhaseTracer2: from the effective potential to gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the prospect of detecting gravitational waves sourced from a strongly first-order cosmological phase transition has emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers of gravitational wave astronomy. Cosmological phase transitions are an essential ingredient in the Standard Model of particle cosmology, and help explain the mechanism for creation of matter in the early Universe, provide insights into fundamental theories of physics, and shed light on the nature of dark matter. This underscores the significance of developing robust end-to-end tools for determining the resulting gravitational waves from these phase transitions. In this article we present PhaseTracer2, an improved version of the C++ software package PhaseTracer, designed for mapping cosmological phases and transitions in Standard Model extensions of multiple scalar fields. Building on the robust framework of its predecessor, PhaseTracer2 extends its capabilities by including new features crucial for a more comprehensive analysis of cosmological phase transitions. It can calculate more complex properties, such as the bounce action through the path deformation method or an interface with BubbleProfiler, thermodynamic parameters, and gravitational wave spectra. Its applicability has also been broadened via incorporating the dimensionally reduced effective potential for models obtained from DRalgo, as well as calculations in the MSbar and OS-like renormalisation schemes. This modular, flexible, and practical upgrade retains the speed and stability of the original PhaseTracer, while significantly expanding its utility.</description>

      <title>Returning Back to Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have re-examined Mukhanov parametrization for inflationary equation of state, $1+\omega=\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, in the light of Planck 2018 results and latest bound of tensor-to-scalar ratio employing Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We have found that the current observational values of scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can be used efficiently to constrain the model parameters. The recent bound of $r&lt;0.032$ has been used to put an upper bound on one of the model parameter. Whereas 1-$\sigma$ bound of the scalar spectral index $0.9607\leq n_{_S}\leq 0.9691$ along with the upper bound of tensor-to-scalar ratio provided restriction on the other model parameter $1.50&lt;\alpha\leq2.20$. These bounds however depend on the number of e-foldings still left before the end of inflation and whenever $1.50&lt;\alpha\leq2.20$ we can find appropriate values of the other model parameter $\beta$ so that the observational predictions are in tune with the latest available inflationary observables. We have further utilized the predictions from forthcoming CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD in order to obtain bounds on the model parameters. We find that detection of gravity waves would help us constrain the model parameters further. But in the absence of detection of primordial gravity wave signal by these CMB missions may rule out Mukhanov parametrization.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE in a super-renormalizable 2D $O(N)$ quartic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of logarithms on the asymptotic behavior of power expansion/OPE in supper-renormalizable QFTs. We performed a careful investigation of the large $p^2$ expansion of a scalar-scalar two-point function at the next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion, in a large-$N$ $O(N)$ quartic model that is populated by logarithms. We show that because the large-$p^2$ logarithms of the individual bubbles can be amplified by bubble-chains, there are factorial enhancements to the power expansion. We show how the factorial enhancements appear separately in the coefficient functions and operator condensates, and demonstrate how they are cancelled off-diagonally across different powers. Restricted to any given power, the factorial enhancements are no-longer canceled. The large-$p^2$ power expansion is divergent.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions and boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courant-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave with Domain Wall Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) can be produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken, and long-lived DWs can dominate the energy density of the universe. In this work, we explore the possibility that a "domain wall dominant (DWD)" phase existed in the early universe and ended with DW decay. During the DWD phase, the universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor and exhibits temporal superhorizon evolution of the relevant frequency modes. We show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to distinguishable long-lived DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources, with significant implications for future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-dS transitions vs. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at $z =$ 2.3-2.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, written in memory of Alexei Starobinsky, we discuss the observational viability of the Ph-$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model - a dynamical dark energy scenario based on a phantom scalar field undergoing an anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) transition - and revisit the Sahni-Shtanov braneworld model in light of updated BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \sim 2.3$. Both models are able to remain consistent with Planck CMB data while offering potential resolutions to the $H_0$ tension. In both cases, the expansion rate $H(z)$ is suppressed relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM at high redshift and enhanced at low redshift, while remaining consistent with the comoving distance to recombination as estimated by Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Comparing model predictions with BAO-inferred values of $H(z)$, we find that SDSS Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \approx 2.33$ mildly favor such dynamical models, whereas the recent DESI Ly-$\alpha$ measurements agree more closely with $\Lambda$CDM. Although current high-redshift BAO data do not decisively favor one model over another, our findings illustrate how frameworks originally developed to address earlier anomalies - such as the braneworld scenario - may gain renewed relevance in confronting today's cosmological tensions.</description>
