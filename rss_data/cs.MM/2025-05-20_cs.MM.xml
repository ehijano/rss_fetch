      <title>Enhanced Multimodal Hate Video Detection via Channel-wise and Modality-wise Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has transformed information dissemination, but it has also facilitated the spread of harmful content, particularly hate videos. Despite significant efforts to combat hate speech, detecting these videos remains challenging due to their often implicit nature. Current detection methods primarily rely on unimodal approaches, which inadequately capture the complementary features across different modalities. While multimodal techniques offer a broader perspective, many fail to effectively integrate temporal dynamics and modality-wise interactions essential for identifying nuanced hate content. In this paper, we present CMFusion, an enhanced multimodal hate video detection model utilizing a novel Channel-wise and Modality-wise Fusion Mechanism. CMFusion first extracts features from text, audio, and video modalities using pre-trained models and then incorporates a temporal cross-attention mechanism to capture dependencies between video and audio streams. The learned features are then processed by channel-wise and modality-wise fusion modules to obtain informative representations of videos. Our extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CMFusion significantly outperforms five widely used baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Comprehensive ablation studies and parameter analyses further validate our design choices, highlighting the model's effectiveness in detecting hate videos. The source codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/EvelynZ10/cmfusion.</description>

      <title>Hearing from Silence: Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos via Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can intuitively infer sounds from silent videos, but whether multimodal large language models can perform modal-mismatch reasoning without accessing target modalities remains relatively unexplored. Current text-assisted-video-to-audio (VT2A) methods excel in video foley tasks but struggle to acquire audio descriptions during inference. We introduce the task of Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos (SVAD) to address this challenge and investigate vision-language models' (VLMs) capabilities on this task. To further enhance the VLMs' reasoning capacity for the SVAD task, we construct a CoT-AudioCaps dataset and propose a Chain-of-Thought-based supervised fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on SVAD and subsequent VT2A tasks demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two key aspects: significantly improving VLMs' modal-mismatch reasoning for SVAD and effectively addressing the challenge of acquiring audio descriptions during VT2A inference.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-enhanced Multi-perspective Video Representation Learning for Scene Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in real-world applications, a comprehensive representation of videos becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we address the problem of video scene recognition, whose goal is to learn a high-level video representation to classify scenes in videos. Due to the diversity and complexity of video contents in realistic scenarios, this task remains a challenge. Most existing works identify scenes for videos only from visual or textual information in a temporal perspective, ignoring the valuable information hidden in single frames, while several earlier studies only recognize scenes for separate images in a non-temporal perspective. We argue that these two perspectives are both meaningful for this task and complementary to each other, meanwhile, externally introduced knowledge can also promote the comprehension of videos. We propose a novel two-stream framework to model video representations from multiple perspectives, i.e. temporal and non-temporal perspectives, and integrate the two perspectives in an end-to-end manner by self-distillation. Besides, we design a knowledge-enhanced feature fusion and label prediction method that contributes to naturally introducing knowledge into the task of video scene recognition. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Generating Digital Models Using Text-to-3D and Image-to-3D Prompts: Critical Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the world of technology and AI, digital models play an important role in our lives and are an essential part of the digital twins of real-world objects. They can be created by designers, artists, or game developers using spline curves and surfaces, meshes, and voxels, but making such models is too time-consuming. With the growth of AI tools, there is interest in the automated generation of 3D models, such as generative design approaches, which can save creators valuable time. This paper reviews several online 3D model generators and critically analyses the results, hoping to see higher-quality results from different prompts.</description>

      <title>VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.</description>

      <title>Protocol as Poetry: Case Study on Pak's Protocol Arts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protocol art emerges at the confluence of blockchain-based smart contracts and a century-long lineage of conceptual art, participatory art, and algorithmic generative art practices. Yet existing definitions-most notably Primavera De Filippi's "protocolism"-struggle to demarcate this nascent genre from other art forms in practice. Addressing this definition-to-practice gap, this paper offers a focused case study of pioneering protocol artworks by Pak, an early and influential pseudonymous protocol artist who treats smart contracts as medium and protocol participation as message. Tracing the evolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible and the dynamic mechanics of Merge to the soul-bound messaging of Censored and the reflective absence of Not Found, we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across collectors and autonomous contracts, showing how programmable protocols become a social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's works, we identify seven core characteristics that distinguish protocol art: (1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous governance for open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal authorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economic-driven engagement, (6) poetic message embedding in interaction rituals, and (7) interoperability enabling composability for emergence. We then discuss how these features set protocol art apart from adjacent artistic movements. By developing a theoretical framework grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to the emerging literature on protocolism while offering design implications for artists shaping this evolving art form.</description>

      <title>Rebalancing Contrastive Alignment with Learnable Semantic Gaps in Text-Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-video retrieval have been largely driven by contrastive learning frameworks. However, existing methods overlook a key source of optimization tension: the separation between text and video distributions in the representation space (referred to as the modality gap), and the prevalence of false negatives in batch sampling. These factors lead to conflicting gradients under the InfoNCE loss, impeding stable alignment. To mitigate this, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces a learnable, pair-specific increment Delta_ij between text t_i and video v_j to offload the tension from the global anchor representation. We first derive the ideal form of Delta_ij via a coupled multivariate first-order Taylor approximation of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, revealing it as a mechanism for resolving gradient conflicts by guiding updates along a locally optimal descent direction. Due to the high cost of directly computing Delta_ij, we introduce a lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic gap between each video-text pair, enabling structure-aware correction guided by gradient supervision. To further stabilize learning and promote interpretability, we regularize Delta using three components: a trust-region constraint to prevent oscillation, a directional diversity term to promote semantic coverage, and an information bottleneck to limit redundancy. Experiments across four retrieval benchmarks show that GARE consistently improves alignment accuracy and robustness to noisy supervision, confirming the effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.</description>

      <title>Text2midi-InferAlign: Improving Symbolic Music Generation with Inference-Time Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Text2midi-InferAlign, a novel technique for improving symbolic music generation at inference time. Our method leverages text-to-audio alignment and music structural alignment rewards during inference to encourage the generated music to be consistent with the input caption. Specifically, we introduce two objectives scores: a text-audio consistency score that measures rhythmic alignment between the generated music and the original text caption, and a harmonic consistency score that penalizes generated music containing notes inconsistent with the key. By optimizing these alignment-based objectives during the generation process, our model produces symbolic music that is more closely tied to the input captions, thereby improving the overall quality and coherence of the generated compositions. Our approach can extend any existing autoregressive model without requiring further training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our work on top of Text2midi - an existing text-to-midi generation model, demonstrating significant improvements in both objective and subjective evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>FLASH: Latent-Aware Semi-Autoregressive Speculative Decoding for Multimodal Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language and multimodal models (LLMs and LMMs) exhibit strong inference capabilities but are often limited by slow decoding speeds. This challenge is especially acute in LMMs, where visual inputs typically comprise more tokens with lower information density than text -- an issue exacerbated by recent trends toward finer-grained visual tokenizations to boost performance. Speculative decoding has been effective in accelerating LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to generate candidate tokens, which are then selectively verified by the target model, improving speed without sacrificing output quality. While this strategy has been extended to LMMs, existing methods largely overlook the unique properties of visual inputs and depend solely on text-based draft models. In this work, we propose \textbf{FLASH} (Fast Latent-Aware Semi-Autoregressive Heuristics), a speculative decoding framework designed specifically for LMMs, which leverages two key properties of multimodal data to design the draft model. First, to address redundancy in visual tokens, we propose a lightweight latent-aware token compression mechanism. Second, recognizing that visual objects often co-occur within a scene, we employ a semi-autoregressive decoding strategy to generate multiple tokens per forward pass. These innovations accelerate draft decoding while maintaining high acceptance rates, resulting in faster overall inference. Experiments show that FLASH significantly outperforms prior speculative decoding approaches in both unimodal and multimodal settings, achieving up to \textbf{2.68$\times$} speed-up on video captioning and \textbf{2.55$\times$} on visual instruction tuning tasks compared to the original LMM.</description>

      <title>Anti-Inpainting: A Proactive Defense against Malicious Diffusion-based Inpainters under Unknown Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As diffusion-based malicious image manipulation becomes increasingly prevalent, multiple proactive defense methods are developed to safeguard images against unauthorized tampering. However, most proactive defense methods only can safeguard images against manipulation under known conditions, and fail to protect images from manipulations guided by tampering conditions crafted by malicious users. To tackle this issue, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive defense method that achieves adequate protection under unknown conditions through a triple mechanism to address this challenge. Specifically, a multi-level deep feature extractor is presented to obtain intricate features during the diffusion denoising process to improve protective effectiveness. We design multi-scale semantic-preserving data augmentation to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions by multi-scale transformations while preserving semantic integrity. In addition, we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to improve the protection of adversarial perturbation against manipulation under diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments indicate the proactive defensive performance of Anti-Inpainting against diffusion-based inpainters guided by unknown conditions in InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ. At the same time, we also demonstrate the proposed approach's robustness under various image purification methods and its transferability across different versions of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>MMAR: A Challenging Benchmark for Deep Reasoning in Speech, Audio, Music, and Their Mix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MMAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the deep reasoning capabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) across massive multi-disciplinary tasks. MMAR comprises 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets, collected from real-world internet videos and refined through iterative error corrections and quality checks to ensure high quality. Unlike existing benchmarks that are limited to specific domains of sound, music, or speech, MMAR extends them to a broad spectrum of real-world audio scenarios, including mixed-modality combinations of sound, music, and speech. Each question in MMAR is hierarchically categorized across four reasoning layers: Signal, Perception, Semantic, and Cultural, with additional sub-categories within each layer to reflect task diversity and complexity. To further foster research in this area, we annotate every question with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationale to promote future advancements in audio reasoning. Each item in the benchmark demands multi-step deep reasoning beyond surface-level understanding. Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. We evaluate MMAR using a broad set of models, including Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), Large Audio Reasoning Models (LARMs), Omni Language Models (OLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with audio caption inputs. The performance of these models on MMAR highlights the benchmark's challenging nature, and our analysis further reveals critical limitations of understanding and reasoning capabilities among current models. We hope MMAR will serve as a catalyst for future advances in this important but little-explored area.</description>

      <title>Learning Driven Elastic Task Multi-Connectivity Immersive Computing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In virtual reality (VR) environments, computational tasks exhibit an elastic nature, meaning they can dynamically adjust based on various user and system constraints. This elasticity is essential for maintaining immersive experiences; however, it also introduces challenges for communication and computing in VR systems. In this paper, we investigate elastic task offloading for multi-user edge-computing-enabled VR systems with multi-connectivity, aiming to maximize the computational energy-efficiency (computational throughput per unit of energy consumed). To balance the induced communication, computation, energy consumption, and quality of experience trade-offs due to the elasticity of VR tasks, we formulate a constrained stochastic computational energy-efficiency optimization problem that integrates the multi-connectivity/multi-user action space and the elastic nature of VR computational tasks. We formulate a centralized phasic policy gradient (CPPG) framework to solve the problem of interest online, using only prior elastic task offloading statistics (energy consumption, response time, and transmission time), and task information (i.e., task size and computational intensity), while observing the induced system performance (energy consumption and latency). We further extend our approach to decentralized learning by formulating an independent phasic policy gradient (IPPG) method and a decentralized shared multi-armed bandit (DSMAB) method. We train our methods with real-world 4G, 5G, and WiGig network traces and 360 video datasets to evaluate their performance in terms of response time, energy efficiency, scalability, and delivered quality of experience. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of task size and its effect on offloading policy and system performance. In particular, we show that CPPG reduces latency by 28% and energy consumption by 78% compared to IPPG.</description>

To balance the communication-computation trade-offs that arise herein, we formulate a video quality maximization problem that integrates interdependent multitask/multi-user action spaces and rebuffering time/quality variation constraints. We formulate a deep reinforcement learning framework for \underline{m}ulti-\underline{t}ask \underline{r}ate adaptation and \underline{c}omputation distribution (MTRC) to solve the problem of interest. Our solution does not rely on a priori knowledge about the environment and uses only prior video streaming statistics (e.g., throughput, decoding time, and transmission delay), and content information, to adjust the assigned video bitrates and computation distribution, as it observes the induced streaming performance online. Moreover, to capture the task interdependence in the environment, we leverage neural network cascades to extend our MTRC method to two novel variants denoted as R1C2 and C1R2. We train all three methods with real-world mmWave network traces and $360^\circ$ video datasets to evaluate their performance in terms of expected quality of experience (QoE), viewport peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), rebuffering time, and quality variation. We outperform state-of-the-art rate adaptation algorithms, with C1R2 showing best results and achieving $5.21-6.06$ dB PSNR gains, $2.18-2.70$x rebuffering time reduction, and $4.14-4.50$ dB quality variation reduction.</description>

      <title>TCC-Bench: Benchmarking the Traditional Chinese Culture Understanding Capabilities of MLLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of artificial intelligence systems to understand and generate multimodal content. However, these models often exhibit limited effectiveness when applied to non-Western cultural contexts, which raises concerns about their wider applicability. To address this limitation, we propose the Traditional Chinese Culture understanding Benchmark (TCC-Bench), a bilingual (i.e., Chinese and English) Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for assessing the understanding of traditional Chinese culture by MLLMs. TCC-Bench comprises culturally rich and visually diverse data, incorporating images from museum artifacts, everyday life scenes, comics, and other culturally significant contexts. We adopt a semi-automated pipeline that utilizes GPT-4o in text-only mode to generate candidate questions, followed by human curation to ensure data quality and avoid potential data leakage. The benchmark also avoids language bias by preventing direct disclosure of cultural concepts within question texts. Experimental evaluations across a wide range of MLLMs demonstrate that current models still face significant challenges when reasoning about culturally grounded visual content. The results highlight the need for further research in developing culturally inclusive and context-aware multimodal systems. The code and data can be found at: https://tcc-bench.github.io/.</description>

      <title>A Bounding Box is Worth One Token: Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model for Document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many studies have demonstrated that exclusively incorporating OCR-derived text and spatial layouts with large language models (LLMs) can be highly effective for document understanding tasks. However, existing methods that integrate spatial layouts with text have limitations, such as producing overly long text sequences or failing to fully leverage the autoregressive traits of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model (LayTextLLM)} for document understanding. LayTextLLM projects each bounding box to a single embedding and interleaves it with text, efficiently avoiding long sequence issues while leveraging autoregressive traits of LLMs. LayTextLLM not only streamlines the interaction of layout and textual data but also shows enhanced performance in KIE and VQA. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations reveal significant improvements of LayTextLLM, with a 15.2% increase on KIE tasks and 10.7% on VQA tasks compared to previous SOTA OCR-based LLMs. All resources are available at https://github.com/LayTextLLM/LayTextLLM.</description>

      <title>Scene-Text Grounding for Text-Based Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing efforts in text-based video question answering (TextVideoQA) are criticized for their opaque decisionmaking and heavy reliance on scene-text recognition. In this paper, we propose to study Grounded TextVideoQA by forcing models to answer questions and spatio-temporally localize the relevant scene-text regions, thus decoupling QA from scenetext recognition and promoting research towards interpretable QA. The task has three-fold significance. First, it encourages scene-text evidence versus other short-cuts for answer predictions. Second, it directly accepts scene-text regions as visual answers, thus circumventing the problem of ineffective answer evaluation by stringent string matching. Third, it isolates the challenges inherited in VideoQA and scene-text recognition. This enables the diagnosis of the root causes for failure predictions, e.g., wrong QA or wrong scene-text recognition? To achieve Grounded TextVideoQA, we propose the T2S-QA model that highlights a disentangled temporal-to-spatial contrastive learning strategy for weakly-supervised scene-text grounding and grounded TextVideoQA. To facilitate evaluation, we construct a new dataset ViTXT-GQA which features 52K scene-text bounding boxes within 2.2K temporal segments related to 2K questions and 729 videos. With ViTXT-GQA, we perform extensive experiments and demonstrate the severe limitations of existing techniques in Grounded TextVideoQA. While T2S-QA achieves superior results, the large performance gap with human leaves ample space for improvement. Our further analysis of oracle scene-text inputs posits that the major challenge is scene-text recognition.

      <title>REArtGS: Reconstructing and Generating Articulated Objects via 3D Gaussian Splatting with Geometric and Motion Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Articulated objects, as prevalent entities in human life, their 3D representations play crucial roles across various applications. However, achieving both high-fidelity textured surface reconstruction and dynamic generation for articulated objects remains challenging for existing methods. In this paper, we present REArtGS, a novel framework that introduces additional geometric and motion constraints to 3D Gaussian primitives, enabling high-quality textured surface reconstruction and generation for articulated objects. Specifically, given multi-view RGB images of arbitrary two states of articulated objects, we first introduce an unbiased Signed Distance Field (SDF) guidance to regularize Gaussian opacity fields, enhancing geometry constraints and improving surface reconstruction quality. Then we establish deformable fields for 3D Gaussians constrained by the kinematic structures of articulated objects, achieving unsupervised generation of surface meshes in unseen states. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate our approach achieves high-quality textured surface reconstruction for given states, and enables high-fidelity surface generation for unseen states. Codes will be released after acceptance and the project website is at https://sites.google.com/view/reartgs/home.</description>

      <title>PAHA: Parts-Aware Audio-Driven Human Animation with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven human animation technology is widely used in human-computer interaction, and the emergence of diffusion models has further advanced its development. Currently, most methods rely on multi-stage generation and intermediate representations, resulting in long inference time and issues with generation quality in specific foreground regions and audio-motion consistency. These shortcomings are primarily due to the lack of localized fine-grained supervised guidance. To address above challenges, we propose PAHA, an end-to-end audio-driven upper-body human animation framework with diffusion model. We introduce two key methods: Parts-Aware Re-weighting (PAR) and Parts Consistency Enhancement (PCE). PAR dynamically adjusts regional training loss weights based on pose confidence scores, effectively improving visual quality. PCE constructs and trains diffusion-based regional audio-visual classifiers to improve the consistency of motion and co-speech audio. Afterwards, we design two novel inference guidance methods for the foregoing classifiers, Sequential Guidance (SG) and Differential Guidance (DG), to balance efficiency and quality respectively. Additionally, we build CNAS, the first public Chinese News Anchor Speech dataset, to advance research and validation in this field. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that PAHA significantly outperforms existing methods in audio-motion alignment and video-related evaluations. The codes and CNAS dataset will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>ArrayDPS: Unsupervised Blind Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR.
