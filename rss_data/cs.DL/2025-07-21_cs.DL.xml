      <title>Analysis of the Publication and Document Types in OpenAlex, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Semantic Scholar</title>

Abstract: The assignment of document and publication types in scholarly databases plays an important role in bibliometrics, for example in decision-making or university rankings. However, scholarly databases apply different curation strategies and taxonomies when classifying documents which makes it difficult to compare results from different database providers. In this study, the bibliometric databases OpenAlex, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Semantic Scholar are used to analyse the extent of data variation and compare different approaches to taxonomy and data curation. Using a shared corpus of 9,575,603 publications from 2012 to 2022, we found large differences in the classification of document types such as research articles and editorials in these databases. We can also show that many of the records that lack a publication type in OpenAlex are classified as conference proceedings in Scopus and Semantic Scholar.</description>

      <title>ExtracTable: Human-in-the-Loop Transformation of Scientific Corpora into Structured Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the volume of scientific literature grows, efficient knowledge organization becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional approaches to structuring scientific content are time-consuming and require significant domain expertise, highlighting the need for tool support. We present ExtracTable, a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflow and framework that assists researchers in transforming unstructured publications into structured representations. The workflow combines large language models (LLMs) with user-defined schemas and is designed for downstream integration into knowledge graphs (KGs). Developed and evaluated in the context of the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), ExtracTable automates key steps such as document preprocessing and data extraction while ensuring user oversight through validation. In an evaluation with ORKG community participants following the Quality Improvement Paradigm (QIP), ExtracTable demonstrated high usability and practical value. Participants gave it an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 84.17 (A+, the highest rating). The time to progress from a research interest to literature-based insights was reduced from between 4 hours and 2 weeks to an average of 24:40 minutes. By streamlining corpus creation and structured data extraction for knowledge graph integration, ExtracTable leverages LLMs and user models to accelerate literature reviews. However, human validation remains essential to ensure quality, and future work will address improving extraction accuracy and entity linking to existing knowledge resources.</description>

      <title>OntoPortal-Astro, a Semantic Artefact Catalogue for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astronomy communities are widely recognised as mature communities for their open science practices. However, while their data ecosystems are rather advanced and permit efficient data interoperability, there are still gaps between these ecosystems. Semantic artefacts (SAs) -- e.g., ontologies, thesauri, vocabularies or metadata schemas -- are a means to bridge that gap as they allow to semantically described the data and map the underlying concepts. The increasing use of SAs in astronomy presents challenges in description, selection, evaluation, trust, and mappings. The landscape remains fragmented, with SAs scattered across various registries in diverse formats and structures -- not yet fully developed or encoded with rich semantic web standards like OWL or SKOS -- and often with overlapping scopes. Enhancing data semantic interoperability requires common platforms to catalog, align, and facilitate the sharing of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) SAs. In the frame of the FAIR-IMPACT project, we prototyped a SA catalogue for astronomy, heliophysics and planetary sciences. This exercise resulted in improved vocabulary and ontology management in the communities, and is now paving the way for better interdisciplinary data discovery and reuse. This article presents current practices in our discipline, reviews candidate SAs for such a catalogue, presents driving use cases and the perspective of a real production service for the astronomy community based on the OntoPortal technology, that will be called OntoPortal-Astro.</description>
