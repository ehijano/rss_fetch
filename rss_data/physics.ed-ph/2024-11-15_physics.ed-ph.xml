      <title>Simple methods for converting equations between the SI, Heaviside-Lorentz and Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: School and undergraduate students are almost always taught the equations of electromagnetism using a set of conventions that are described as the SI. More advanced students are often introduced to different conventions that produce different equations for the same relationships, using either the Gaussian or Heaviside-Lorentz systems. In general, the connection between these equations is not simple. However, if the basis of each system is understood, conversion from SI equations to either Gaussian or Heaviside-Lorentz ones is very straightforward. The reverse processes are less straightforward, but more comprehensible when the fundamental differences are understood. Simple methods for these processes are presented, using a novel application of dimensional analysis, without factors of (square root (epsilon0)) appearing. It is also shown that when different physical quantities are given different symbols, and these are used consistently, the SI can be seen to provide general equations, with the Gaussian and Heaviside-Lorentz ones being simplifications of them. This removes any need for system-independent versions of electromagnetic equations, with additional parameters that take different values in the different systems, which have been proposed in various forms over many decades.</description>

      <title>Exploring active learning in physics with ISLE-based modules in high school</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a case study of active learning within the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), using the iOLab digital devices. We designed a pilot lab format to enhance student engagement and understanding through direct experimentation, taking advantage of the multifunctional capabilities of the iOLab devices. This paper evaluates the pedagogical effectiveness of integrating ISLE with digital tools for data collection and analysis in physics experiments. The initial findings provide insights into the pedagogical benefits and logistical considerations of using such technologies in a laboratory setting. Although no direct comparison with traditional teaching methods has been made, the observed student engagement and feedback suggest a positive impact on learning outcomes, even within the constraints of the short duration of the interventions.</description>
