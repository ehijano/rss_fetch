      <title>LOVO: Efficient Complex Object Query in Large-Scale Video Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of cameras has led to an exponential increase in video data, creating vast opportunities for applications such as traffic management and crime surveillance. However, querying specific objects from large-scale video datasets presents challenges, including (1) processing massive and continuously growing data volumes, (2) supporting complex query requirements, and (3) ensuring low-latency execution. Existing video analysis methods struggle with either limited adaptability to unseen object classes or suffer from high query latency. In this paper, we present LOVO, a novel system designed to efficiently handle comp$\underline{L}$ex $\underline{O}$bject queries in large-scale $\underline{V}$ide$\underline{O}$ datasets. Agnostic to user queries, LOVO performs one-time feature extraction using pre-trained visual encoders, generating compact visual embeddings for key frames to build an efficient index. These visual embeddings, along with associated bounding boxes, are organized in an inverted multi-index structure within a vector database, which supports queries for any objects. During the query phase, LOVO transforms object queries to query embeddings and conducts fast approximate nearest-neighbor searches on the visual embeddings. Finally, a cross-modal rerank is performed to refine the results by fusing visual features with detailed textual features. Evaluation on real-world video datasets demonstrates that LOVO outperforms existing methods in handling complex queries, with near-optimal query accuracy and up to 85x lower search latency, while significantly reducing index construction costs. This system redefines the state-of-the-art object query approaches in video analysis, setting a new benchmark for complex object queries with a novel, scalable, and efficient approach that excels in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>A Reproducibility Study of Product-side Fairness in Bundle Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are known to exhibit fairness issues, particularly on the product side, where products and their associated suppliers receive unequal exposure in recommended results. While this problem has been widely studied in traditional recommendation settings, its implications for bundle recommendation (BR) remain largely unexplored. This emerging task introduces additional complexity: recommendations are generated at the bundle level, yet user satisfaction and product (or supplier) exposure depend on both the bundle and the individual items it contains. Existing fairness frameworks and metrics designed for traditional recommender systems may not directly translate to this multi-layered setting. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of product-side fairness in BR across three real-world datasets using four state-of-the-art BR methods. We analyze exposure disparities at both the bundle and item levels using multiple fairness metrics, uncovering important patterns. Our results show that exposure patterns differ notably between bundles and items, revealing the need for fairness interventions that go beyond bundle-level assumptions. We also find that fairness assessments vary considerably depending on the metric used, reinforcing the need for multi-faceted evaluation. Furthermore, user behavior plays a critical role: when users interact more frequently with bundles than with individual items, BR systems tend to yield fairer exposure distributions across both levels. Overall, our findings offer actionable insights for building fairer bundle recommender systems and establish a vital foundation for future research in this emerging domain.</description>

      <title>RaMen: Multi-Strategy Multi-Modal Learning for Bundle Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing studies on bundle construction have relied merely on user feedback via bipartite graphs or enhanced item representations using semantic information. These approaches fail to capture elaborate relations hidden in real-world bundle structures, resulting in suboptimal bundle representations. To overcome this limitation, we propose RaMen, a novel method that provides a holistic multi-strategy approach for bundle construction. RaMen utilizes both intrinsic (characteristics) and extrinsic (collaborative signals) information to model bundle structures through Explicit Strategy-aware Learning (ESL) and Implicit Strategy-aware Learning (ISL). ESL employs task-specific attention mechanisms to encode multi-modal data and direct collaborative relations between items, thereby explicitly capturing essential bundle features. Moreover, ISL computes hyperedge dependencies and hypergraph message passing to uncover shared latent intents among groups of items. Integrating diverse strategies enables RaMen to learn more comprehensive and robust bundle representations. Meanwhile, Multi-strategy Alignment &amp; Discrimination module is employed to facilitate knowledge transfer between learning strategies and ensure discrimination between items/bundles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RaMen over state-of-the-art models on various domains, justifying valuable insights into complex item set problems.</description>

      <title>Understanding Matching Mechanisms in Cross-Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural IR architectures, particularly cross-encoders, are highly effective models whose internal mechanisms are mostly unknown. Most works trying to explain their behavior focused on high-level processes (e.g., what in the input influences the prediction, does the model adhere to known IR axioms) but fall short of describing the matching process. Instead of Mechanistic Interpretability approaches which specifically aim at explaining the hidden mechanisms of neural models, we demonstrate that more straightforward methods can already provide valuable insights. In this paper, we first focus on the attention process and extract causal insights highlighting the crucial roles of some attention heads in this process. Second, we provide an interpretation of the mechanism underlying matching detection.</description>

      <title>Enhancing POI Recommendation through Global Graph Disentanglement with POI Weighted Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next point of interest (POI) recommendation primarily predicts future activities based on users' past check-in data and current status, providing significant value to users and service providers. We observed that the popular check-in times for different POI categories vary. For example, coffee shops are crowded in the afternoon because people like to have coffee to refresh after meals, while bars are busy late at night. However, existing methods rarely explore the relationship between POI categories and time, which may result in the model being unable to fully learn users' tendencies to visit certain POI categories at different times. Additionally, existing methods for modeling time information often convert it into time embeddings or calculate the time interval and incorporate it into the model, making it difficult to capture the continuity of time. Finally, during POI prediction, various weighting information is often ignored, such as the popularity of each POI, the transition relationships between POIs, and the distances between POIs, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel next POI recommendation framework called Graph Disentangler with POI Weighted Module (GDPW). This framework aims to jointly consider POI category information and multiple POI weighting factors. Specifically, the proposed GDPW learns category and time representations through the Global Category Graph and the Global Category-Time Graph. Then, we disentangle category and time information through contrastive learning. After prediction, the final POI recommendation for users is obtained by weighting the prediction results based on the transition weights and distance relationships between POIs. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed GDPW outperforms other existing models, improving performance by 3% to 11%.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Legal Document Retrieval in Vietnamese with Semi-Hard Negative Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized domains like law, where precision and domain-specific knowledge are critical. This paper presents a streamlined two-stage framework consisting of Retrieval and Re-ranking to enhance legal document retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our approach employs a fine-tuned Bi-Encoder for rapid candidate retrieval, followed by a Cross-Encoder for precise re-ranking, both optimized through strategic negative example mining. Key innovations include the introduction of the Exist@m metric to evaluate retrieval effectiveness and the use of semi-hard negatives to mitigate training bias, which significantly improved re-ranking performance. Evaluated on the SoICT Hackathon 2024 for Legal Document Retrieval, our team, 4Huiter, achieved a top-three position. While top-performing teams employed ensemble models and iterative self-training on large bge-m3 architectures, our lightweight, single-pass approach offered a competitive alternative with far fewer parameters. The framework demonstrates that optimized data processing, tailored loss functions, and balanced negative sampling are pivotal for building robust retrieval-augmented systems in legal contexts.</description>

      <title>U-MARVEL: Unveiling Key Factors for Universal Multimodal Retrieval via Embedding Learning with MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal multimodal retrieval (UMR), which aims to address complex retrieval tasks where both queries and candidates span diverse modalities, has been significantly advanced by the emergence of MLLMs. While state-of-the-art MLLM-based methods in the literature predominantly adopt contrastive learning principles, they often differ in their specific training recipes. Despite their success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL (\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings, and also exihibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval. These results underscore the generalization potential of our framework across various embedding-based retrieval tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/chaxjli/U-MARVEL</description>

      <title>User Invariant Preference Learning for Multi-Behavior Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-behavior recommendation scenarios, analyzing users' diverse behaviors, such as click, purchase, and rating, enables a more comprehensive understanding of their interests, facilitating personalized and accurate recommendations. A fundamental assumption of multi-behavior recommendation methods is the existence of shared user preferences across behaviors, representing users' intrinsic interests. Based on this assumption, existing approaches aim to integrate information from various behaviors to enrich user representations. However, they often overlook the presence of both commonalities and individualities in users' multi-behavior preferences. These individualities reflect distinct aspects of preferences captured by different behaviors, where certain auxiliary behaviors may introduce noise, hindering the prediction of the target behavior. To address this issue, we propose a user invariant preference learning for multi-behavior recommendation (UIPL for short), aiming to capture users' intrinsic interests (referred to as invariant preferences) from multi-behavior interactions to mitigate the introduction of noise. Specifically, UIPL leverages the paradigm of invariant risk minimization to learn invariant preferences. To implement this, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to extract users' invariant preferences, replacing the standard reconstruction loss with an invariant risk minimization constraint. Additionally, we construct distinct environments by combining multi-behavior data to enhance robustness in learning these preferences. Finally, the learned invariant preferences are used to provide recommendations for the target behavior. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that UIPL significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>FullRecall: A Semantic Search-Based Ranking Approach for Maximizing Recall in Patent Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patent examiners and inventors face significant pressure to verify the originality and non-obviousness of inventions, and the intricate nature of patent data intensifies the challenges of patent retrieval. Therefore, there is a pressing need to devise cutting-edge retrieval strategies that can reliably achieve the desired recall. This study introduces FullRecall, a novel patent retrieval approach that effectively manages the complexity of patent data while maintaining the reliability of relevance matching and maximising recall. It leverages IPC-guided knowledge to generate informative phrases, which are processed to extract key information in the form of noun phrases characterising the query patent under observation. From these, the top k keyphrases are selected to construct a query for retrieving a focused subset of the dataset. This initial retrieval step achieves complete recall, successfully capturing all relevant documents. To further refine the results, a ranking scheme is applied to the retrieved subset, reducing its size while maintaining 100% recall. This multi-phase process demonstrates an effective strategy for balancing precision and recall in patent retrieval tasks. Comprehensive experiments were conducted, and the results were compared with baseline studies, namely HRR2 [1] and ReQ-ReC [2]. The proposed approach yielded superior results, achieving 100% recall in all five test cases. However, HRR2[1] recall values across the five test cases were 10%, 25%, 33.3%, 0%, and 14.29%, while ReQ-ReC [2] showed 50% for the first test case, 25% for the second test case, and 0% for the third, fourth, and fifth test cases. The 100% recall ensures that no relevant prior art is overlooked, thereby strengthening the patent pre-filing and examination processes, hence reducing potential legal risks.</description>

      <title>Click A, Buy B: Rethinking Conversion Attribution in E- Commerce Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User journeys in e-commerce routinely violate the one-to-one assumption that a clicked item on an advertising platform is the same item later purchased on the merchant's website/app. For a significant number of converting sessions on our platform, users click product A but buy product B -- the Click A, Buy B (CABB) phenomenon. Training recommendation models on raw click-conversion pairs therefore rewards items that merely correlate with purchases, leading to biased learning and sub-optimal conversion rates. We reframe conversion prediction as a multi-task problem with separate heads for Click A Buy A (CABA) and Click A Buy B (CABB). To isolate informative CABB conversions from unrelated CABB conversions, we introduce a taxonomy-aware collaborative filtering weighting scheme where each product is first mapped to a leaf node in a product taxonomy, and a category-to-category similarity matrix is learned from large-scale co-engagement logs. This weighting amplifies pairs that reflect genuine substitutable or complementary relations while down-weighting coincidental cross-category purchases. Offline evaluation on e-commerce sessions reduces normalized entropy by 13.9% versus a last-click attribution baseline. An online A/B test on live traffic shows +0.25% gains in the primary business metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for academic literature retrieval. However, existing systems often rely on rigid pipelines and exhibit limited reasoning capabilities. We introduce SPAR, a multi-agent framework that incorporates RefChain-based query decomposition and query evolution to enable more flexible and effective search. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we also construct SPARBench, a challenging benchmark with expert-annotated relevance labels. Experimental results demonstrate that SPAR substantially outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to +56% F1 on AutoScholar and +23% F1 on SPARBench over the best-performing baseline. Together, SPAR and SPARBench provide a scalable, interpretable, and high-performing foundation for advancing research in scholarly retrieval.

      <title>GREAT: Guiding Query Generation with a Trie for Recommending Related Search about Video at Kuaishou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, short video platforms have become the primary place for individuals to share experiences and obtain information. To better meet users' needs for acquiring information while browsing short videos, some apps have introduced a search entry at the bottom of videos, accompanied with recommended relevant queries. This scenario is known as query recommendation in video-related search, where core task is item-to-query (I2Q) recommendation. As this scenario has only emerged in recent years, there is a notable scarcity of academic research and publicly available datasets in this domain. To address this gap, we systematically examine the challenges associated with this scenario for the first time. Subsequently, we release a large-scale dataset derived from real-world data pertaining to the query recommendation in video-\textit{\textbf{r}}elated \textit{\textbf{s}}earch on the \textit{\textbf{Kuai}}shou app (\textbf{KuaiRS}). Presently, existing methods rely on embeddings to calculate similarity for matching short videos with queries, lacking deep interaction between the semantic content and the query. In this paper, we introduce a novel LLM-based framework named \textbf{GREAT}, which \textit{\textbf{g}}uides que\textit{\textbf{r}}y g\textit{\textbf{e}}ner\textit{\textbf{a}}tion with a \textit{\textbf{t}}rie to address I2Q recommendation in related search. Specifically, we initially gather high-quality queries with high exposure and click-through rate to construct a query-based trie. During training, we enhance the LLM's capability to generate high-quality queries using the query-based trie. In the inference phase, the query-based trie serves as a guide for the token generation. Finally, we further refine the relevance and literal quality between items and queries via a post-processing module. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Graph Information Bottleneck for Multi-Behavior Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world recommendation scenarios, users typically engage with platforms through multiple types of behavioral interactions. Multi-behavior recommendation algorithms aim to leverage various auxiliary user behaviors to enhance prediction for target behaviors of primary interest (e.g., buy), thereby overcoming performance limitations caused by data sparsity in target behavior records. Current state-of-the-art approaches typically employ hierarchical design following either cascading (e.g., view$\rightarrow$cart$\rightarrow$buy) or parallel (unified$\rightarrow$behavior$\rightarrow$specific components) paradigms, to capture behavioral relationships. However, these methods still face two critical challenges: (1) severe distribution disparities across behaviors, and (2) negative transfer effects caused by noise in auxiliary behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic Hierarchical Graph Information Bottleneck (HGIB) framework for multi-behavior recommendation to effectively address these challenges. Following information bottleneck principles, our framework optimizes the learning of compact yet sufficient representations that preserve essential information for target behavior prediction while eliminating task-irrelevant redundancies. To further mitigate interaction noise, we introduce a Graph Refinement Encoder (GRE) that dynamically prunes redundant edges through learnable edge dropout mechanisms. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world public datasets, which demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our framework. Beyond these widely used datasets in the academic community, we further expand our evaluation on several real industrial scenarios and conduct an online A/B testing, showing again a significant improvement in multi-behavior recommendations.

      <title>RankMixer: Scaling Up Ranking Models in Industrial Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress on large language models (LLMs) has spurred interest in scaling up recommendation systems, yet two practical obstacles remain. First, training and serving cost on industrial Recommenders must respect strict latency bounds and high QPS demands. Second, most human-designed feature-crossing modules in ranking models were inherited from the CPU era and fail to exploit modern GPUs, resulting in low Model Flops Utilization (MFU) and poor scalability. We introduce RankMixer, a hardware-aware model design tailored towards a unified and scalable feature-interaction architecture. RankMixer retains the transformer's high parallelism while replacing quadratic self-attention with multi-head token mixing module for higher efficiency. Besides, RankMixer maintains both the modeling for distinct feature subspaces and cross-feature-space interactions with Per-token FFNs. We further extend it to one billion parameters with a Sparse-MoE variant for higher ROI. A dynamic routing strategy is adapted to address the inadequacy and imbalance of experts training. Experiments show RankMixer's superior scaling abilities on a trillion-scale production dataset. By replacing previously diverse handcrafted low-MFU modules with RankMixer, we boost the model MFU from 4.5% to 45%, and scale our ranking model parameters by 100x while maintaining roughly the same inference latency. We verify RankMixer's universality with online A/B tests across three core application scenarios (Recommendation, Advertisement and Search). Finally, we launch 1B Dense-Parameters RankMixer for full traffic serving without increasing the serving cost, which improves user active days by 0.2% and total in-app usage duration by 0.5%.</description>

      <title>Just Ask for Music (JAM): Multimodal and Personalized Natural Language Music Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language interfaces offer a compelling approach for music recommendation, enabling users to express complex preferences conversationally. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in this direction, their scalability in recommender systems is limited by high costs and latency. Retrieval-based approaches using smaller language models mitigate these issues but often rely on single-modal item representations, overlook long-term user preferences, and require full model retraining, posing challenges for real-world deployment. In this paper, we present JAM (Just Ask for Music), a lightweight and intuitive framework for natural language music recommendation. JAM models user-query-item interactions as vector translations in a shared latent space, inspired by knowledge graph embedding methods like TransE. To capture the complexity of music and user intent, JAM aggregates multimodal item features via cross-attention and sparse mixture-of-experts. We also introduce JAMSessions, a new dataset of over 100k user-query-item triples with anonymized user/item embeddings, uniquely combining conversational queries and user long-term preferences. Our results show that JAM provides accurate recommendations, produces intuitive representations suitable for practical use cases, and can be easily integrated with existing music recommendation stacks.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Fusion of IQ and FFT Spectrograms with AoA Features for GNSS Jammer Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Training oscillator Ising machines to assign the dynamic stability of their equilibrium points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network model, which, with appropriate assignment of the stability of its equilibrium points (EPs), achieves Hopfield-like associative memory. The oscillator Ising machine (OIM) is an ideal candidates for such a model, as all its $0/\pi$ binary EPs are structurally stable with their dynamic stability tunable by the coupling weights. Traditional Hopfield-based models store the desired patterns by designing the coupling weights between neurons. The design of coupling weights should simultaneously take into account both the existence and the dynamic stability of the EPs for the storage of the desired patterns. For OIMs, since all $0/\pi$ binary EPs are structurally stable, the design of the coupling weights needs only to focus on assigning appropriate stability for the $0/\pi$ binary EPs according to the desired patterns. In this paper, we establish a connection between the stability and the Hamiltonian energy of EPs for OIMs, and, based on this connection, provide a Hamiltonian-Regularized Eigenvalue Contrastive Method (HRECM) to train the coupling weights of OIMs for assigning appropriate stability to their EPs. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>GRACE: Generative Recommendation via Journey-Aware Sparse Attention on Chain-of-Thought Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated strong potential in multi-behavior recommendation systems, leveraging the expressive power of transformers and tokenization to generate personalized item sequences. However, their adoption is hindered by (1) the lack of explicit information for token reasoning, (2) high computational costs due to quadratic attention complexity and dense sequence representations after tokenization, and (3) limited multi-scale modeling over user history. In this work, we propose GRACE (Generative Recommendation via journey-aware sparse Attention on Chain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit attributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over semantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation. To address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware Sparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed, intra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9% HR@10 and +106.7% NDCG@10 improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Home domain, and +22.1% HR@10 on the Electronics domain. GRACE also reduces attention computation by up to 48% with long sequences.</description>

      <title>DeRAG: Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Multiple Retrieval-Augmented Generation Applications via Prompt Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial prompt attacks can significantly alter the reliability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by re-ranking them to produce incorrect outputs. In this paper, we present a novel method that applies Differential Evolution (DE) to optimize adversarial prompt suffixes for RAG-based question answering. Our approach is gradient-free, treating the RAG pipeline as a black box and evolving a population of candidate suffixes to maximize the retrieval rank of a targeted incorrect document to be closer to real world scenarios. We conducted experiments on the BEIR QA datasets to evaluate attack success at certain retrieval rank thresholds under multiple retrieving applications. Our results demonstrate that DE-based prompt optimization attains competitive (and in some cases higher) success rates compared to GGPP to dense retrievers and PRADA to sparse retrievers, while using only a small number of tokens (&lt;=5 tokens) in the adversarial suffix. Furthermore, we introduce a readability-aware suffix construction strategy, validated by a statistically significant reduction in MLM negative log-likelihood with Welch's t-test. Through evaluations with a BERT-based adversarial suffix detector, we show that DE-generated suffixes evade detection, yielding near-chance detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Fisher's exact test justification of the TF-IDF term-weighting scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Term frequency-inverse document frequency, or TF-IDF for short, is arguably the most celebrated mathematical expression in the history of information retrieval. Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a given term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of many, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes in diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship dedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that tradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community by demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance testing perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under mild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the $p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical significance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the said negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We further demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to TF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection. The Fisher's exact test justification of TF-IDF equips the working statistician with a ready explanation of the term-weighting scheme's long-established effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Temporal Abstraction of Listwise Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern listwise recommendation systems need to consider both long-term user perceptions and short-term interest shifts. Reinforcement learning can be applied on recommendation to study such a problem but is also subject to large search space, sparse user feedback and long interactive latency. Motivated by recent progress in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a novel framework called mccHRL to provide different levels of temporal abstraction on listwise recommendation. Within the hierarchical framework, the high-level agent studies the evolution of user perception, while the low-level agent produces the item selection policy by modeling the process as a sequential decision-making problem. We argue that such framework has a well-defined decomposition of the outra-session context and the intra-session context, which are encoded by the high-level and low-level agents, respectively. To verify this argument, we implement both a simulator-based environment and an industrial dataset-based experiment. Results observe significant performance improvement by our method, compared with several well-known baselines. Data and codes have been made public.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems via Large Language Models: A User-Centric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) integrate both recommendation and dialogue tasks, making their evaluation uniquely challenging. Existing approaches primarily assess CRS performance by separately evaluating item recommendation and dialogue management using rule-based metrics. However, these methods fail to capture the real human experience, and they cannot draw direct conclusions about the system's overall performance. As conversational recommender systems become increasingly vital in e-commerce, social media, and customer support, the ability to evaluate both recommendation accuracy and dialogue management quality using a single metric, thereby authentically reflecting user experience, has become the principal challenge impeding progress in this field.
  In this work, we propose a user-centric evaluation framework based on large language models (LLMs) for CRSs, namely Conversational Recommendation Evaluator (CoRE). CoRE consists of two main components: (1) LLM-As-Evaluator. Firstly, we comprehensively summarize 12 key factors influencing user experience in CRSs and directly leverage LLM as an evaluator to assign a score to each factor. (2) Multi-Agent Debater. Secondly, we design a multi-agent debate framework with four distinct roles (common user, domain expert, linguist, and HCI expert) to discuss and synthesize the 12 evaluation factors into a unified overall performance score.
  Furthermore, we apply the proposed framework to evaluate four CRSs on two benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that CoRE aligns well with human evaluation in most of the 12 factors and the overall assessment. Especially, CoRE's overall evaluation scores demonstrate significantly better alignment with human feedback compared to existing rule-based metrics.</description>

Abstract: The burgeoning volume of multi-modal data necessitates advanced retrieval paradigms beyond unimodal and cross-modal approaches. Composed Multi-modal Retrieval (CMR) emerges as a pivotal next-generation technology, enabling users to query images or videos by integrating a reference visual input with textual modifications, thereby achieving unprecedented flexibility and precision. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of CMR, covering its fundamental challenges, technical advancements, and applications. CMR is categorized into supervised, zero-shot, and semi-supervised learning paradigms. We discuss key research directions, including data construction, model architecture, and loss optimization in supervised CMR, as well as transformation frameworks and linear integration in zero-shot CMR, and semi-supervised CMR that leverages generated pseudo-triplets while addressing data noise/uncertainty. Additionally, we extensively survey the diverse application landscape of CMR, highlighting its transformative potential in e-commerce, social media, search engines, public security, etc. Seven high impact application scenarios are explored in detail with benchmark data sets and performance analysis. Finally, we further provide new potential research directions with the hope of inspiring exploration in other yet-to-be-explored fields.

      <title>FIM: Frequency-Aware Multi-View Interest Modeling for Local-Life Service Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People's daily lives involve numerous periodic behaviors, such as eating and traveling. Local-life platforms cater to these recurring needs by providing essential services tied to daily routines. Therefore, users' periodic intentions are reflected in their interactions with the platforms. There are two main challenges in modeling users' periodic behaviors in the local-life service recommendation systems: 1) the diverse demands of users exhibit varying periodicities, which are difficult to distinguish as they are mixed in the behavior sequences; 2) the periodic behaviors of users are subject to dynamic changes due to factors such as holidays and promotional events. Existing methods struggle to distinguish the periodicities of diverse demands and overlook the importance of dynamically capturing changes in users' periodic behaviors. To this end, we employ a Frequency-Aware Multi-View Interest Modeling framework (FIM). Specifically, we propose a multi-view search strategy that decomposes users' demands from different perspectives to separate their various periodic intentions. This allows the model to comprehensively extract their periodic features than category-searched-only methods. Moreover, we propose a frequency-domain perception and evolution module. This module uses the Fourier Transform to convert users' temporal behaviors into the frequency domain, enabling the model to dynamically perceive their periodic features. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that FIM achieves significant improvements on public and industrial datasets, showing its capability to effectively model users' periodic intentions. Furthermore, the model has been deployed on the Kuaishou local-life service platform. Through online A/B experiments, the transaction volume has been significantly improved.</description>

      <title>Know Or Not: a library for evaluating out-of-knowledge base robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have progressed significantly, their use in high-stakes applications have been limited due to risks of hallucination. One key approach in reducing hallucination is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but even in such setups, LLMs may still hallucinate when presented with questions outside of the knowledge base. Such behavior is unacceptable in high-stake applications where LLMs are expected to abstain from answering queries it does not have sufficient context on. In this work, we present a novel methodology for systematically evaluating out-of-knowledge base (OOKB) robustness of LLMs (whether LLMs know or do not know) in the RAG setting, without the need for manual annotation of gold standard answers. We implement our methodology in knowornot, an open-source library that enables users to develop their own customized evaluation data and pipelines for OOKB robustness. knowornot comprises four main features. Firstly, it provides a unified, high-level API that streamlines the process of setting up and running robustness benchmarks. Secondly, its modular architecture emphasizes extensibility and flexibility, allowing users to easily integrate their own LLM clients and RAG settings. Thirdly, its rigorous data modeling design ensures experiment reproducibility, reliability and traceability. Lastly, it implements a comprehensive suite of tools for users to customize their pipelines. We demonstrate the utility of knowornot by developing a challenging benchmark, PolicyBench, which spans four Question-Answer (QA) chatbots on government policies, and analyze its OOKB robustness. The source code of knowornot is available https://github.com/govtech-responsibleai/KnowOrNot.</description>

      <title>Ev2R: Evaluating Evidence Retrieval in Automated Fact-Checking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current automated fact-checking (AFC) approaches typically evaluate evidence either implicitly via the predicted verdicts or through exact matches with predefined closed knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia. However, these methods are limited due to their reliance on evaluation metrics originally designed for other purposes and constraints from closed knowledge sources. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\textcolor{skyblue}{Ev\textsuperscript{2}}\textcolor{orangebrown}{R}} which combines the strengths of reference-based evaluation and verdict-level proxy scoring. Ev\textsuperscript{2}R jointly assesses how well the evidence aligns with the gold references and how reliably it supports the verdict, addressing the shortcomings of prior methods. We evaluate Ev\textsuperscript{2}R against three types of evidence evaluation approaches: reference-based, proxy-reference, and reference-less baselines. Assessments against human ratings and adversarial tests demonstrate that Ev\textsuperscript{2}R consistently outperforms existing scoring approaches in accuracy and robustness. It achieves stronger correlation with human judgments and greater robustness to adversarial perturbations, establishing it as a reliable metric for evidence evaluation in AFC.\footnote{Code is available at \href{https://github.com/mubasharaak/fc-evidence-evaluation}{https://github.com/mubasharaak/fc-evidence-evaluation}.}</description>

      <title>Too Much to Trust? Measuring the Security and Cognitive Impacts of Explainability in AI-Driven SOCs</title>

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) holds significant promise for enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of AI-driven threat detection in Security Operations Centers (SOCs). However, identifying the appropriate level and format of explanation, particularly in environments that demand rapid decision-making under high-stakes conditions, remains a complex and underexplored challenge. To address this gap, we conducted a three-month mixed-methods study combining an online survey (N1=248) with in-depth interviews (N2=24) to examine (1) how SOC analysts conceptualize AI-generated explanations and (2) which types of explanations are perceived as actionable and trustworthy across different analyst roles. Our findings reveal that participants were consistently willing to accept XAI outputs, even in cases of lower predictive accuracy, when explanations were perceived as relevant and evidence-backed. Analysts repeatedly emphasized the importance of understanding the rationale behind AI decisions, expressing a strong preference for contextual depth over a mere presentation of outcomes on dashboards. Building on these insights, this study re-evaluates current explanation methods within security contexts and demonstrates that role-aware, context-rich XAI designs aligned with SOC workflows can substantially improve practical utility. Such tailored explainability enhances analyst comprehension, increases triage efficiency, and supports more confident responses to evolving threats.</description>

      <title>Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09516v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

      <title>SciSage: A Multi-Agent Framework for High-Quality Scientific Survey Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands robust tools for automated survey-generation. However, current large language model (LLM)-based methods often lack in-depth analysis, structural coherence, and reliable citations. To address these limitations, we introduce SciSage, a multi-agent framework employing a reflect-when-you-write paradigm. SciSage features a hierarchical Reflector agent that critically evaluates drafts at outline, section, and document levels, collaborating with specialized agents for query interpretation, content retrieval, and refinement. We also release SurveyScope, a rigorously curated benchmark of 46 high-impact papers (2020-2025) across 11 computer science domains, with strict recency and citation-based quality controls. Evaluations demonstrate that SciSage outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (LLM x MapReduce-V2, AutoSurvey), achieving +1.73 points in document coherence and +32% in citation F1 scores. Human evaluations reveal mixed outcomes (3 wins vs. 7 losses against human-written surveys), but highlight SciSage's strengths in topical breadth and retrieval efficiency. Overall, SciSage offers a promising foundation for research-assistive writing tools.</description>

      <title>SIEVE: Effective Filtered Vector Search with Collection of Indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world tasks such as recommending videos with the kids tag can be reduced to finding most similar vectors associated with hard predicates. This task, filtered vector search, is challenging as prior state-of-the-art graph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques quickly degenerate when hard constraints are considered. That is, effective graph-based filtered similarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching the most similar items within just a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works propose modifying graph traversal to visit only the items that may satisfy predicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide range of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose efficiency if only a small fraction of items satisfy predicates.
  We propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build many indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective construction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing relationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a workload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a collection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to discern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show superior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and forms: our approach achieves up to 8.06x speedup while having as low as 1% build time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15x memory of a standard HNSW graph and modest knowledge of past workloads.</description>
