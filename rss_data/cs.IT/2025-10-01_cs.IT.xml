      <title>Challenges and Solutions in Selecting Optimal Lossless Data Compression Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of digital data has heightened the demand for efficient lossless compression methods. However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs: some achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding speed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch complicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance metrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires both compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present a mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and decoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and balances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling objective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments on image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings. Results also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide superior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when speed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs.</description>

      <title>Secure Beamforming in Multi-User Multi-IRS Millimeter Wave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the secrecy rate maximization problem in a millimeter wave (mmWave) network, consisting of a base station (BS), multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) (or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)), multiple users, and a single eavesdropper. To ensure a fair secrecy rate among all the users, we adopt a max-min fairness criterion which results in a mixed integer problem. We first relax discrete IRSs phase shifts to the continuous ones. To cope with the non-convexity of the relaxed optimization problem, we leverage the penalty method and block coordinate descent approach to divide it into two sub-problems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Then, we propose a low-complexity mapping algorithm where feasible IRSs phase shifts are obtained. Mathematical evaluation shows the convergence of sub-problems to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original ones. Furthermore, the convergence guarantee of the overall proposed algorithm and computational complexity are investigated. Finally, simulation results show our proposed algorithm outweighs the conventional solutions based on the semi-definite programming (SDP) in terms of convergence and secrecy rate, especially in a larger number of IRSs and phase shifts where SDP suffers from rank-one approximation. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and IRS-free systems are also considered as other benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Neural-Model-Augmented Hybrid NMS-OSD Decoders for Near-ML in Short Block Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid decoding architecture that serially couples a normalized min-sum (NMS) decoder with reinforced ordered statistics decoding (OSD) to achieve near-maximum likelihood (ML) performance for short linear block codes. The framework incorporates several key innovations: a decoding information aggregation model that employs a convolutional neural network to refine bit reliability estimates for OSD using the soft-output trajectory of the NMS decoder; an adaptive decoding path for OSD, initialized by the arranged list of the most a priori likely tests algorithm and dynamically updated with empirical data; and a sliding window assisted model that enables early termination of test error patterns' traversal, curbing complexity with minimal performance loss. For short high-rate codes, a dedicated undetected error detector identifies erroneous NMS outcomes that satisfy parity checks, ensuring they are forwarded to OSD for correction. Extensive simulations on LDPC, BCH, and RS codes demonstrate that the proposed hybrid decoder delivers a competitive trade-off, achieving near-ML frame error rate performance while maintaining advantages in throughput, latency, and complexity over state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of NMDS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $[n,k,d]$ linear code is said to be maximum distance separable (MDS) or almost maximum distance separable (AMDS) if $d=n-k+1$ or $d=n-k$, respectively. If a code and its dual code are both AMDS, then the code is said to be near maximum distance separable (NMDS). For $k=3$ and $k=4$, there are many constructions of NMDS codes by adding some suitable projective points to arcs in $\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$. In this paper, we consider the monomial equivalence problem for some NMDS codes with the same weight distributions and present new constructions of NMDS codes.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Net-Based RIS Precoding Design without Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components. To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning methods based on traditional channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Precoding for Multi-RIS-Aided Multiuser Downlink Systems with Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user distributions.</description>

      <title>Coordinated FMCW and OFDM for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a coordinated FMCW-OFDM (Co-FMCW-OFDM) system that enables integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) by allowing sensing and communication to share the same RF front end, antennas, and spectral resources. In the proposed ISAC system, the FMCW signal is superimposed on the OFDM signal and serves dual purposes: facilitating bistatic sensing and enabling channel estimation at the receiver end. Based on proposed Co-FMCW-OFDM waveform, we propose two efficient sensing algorithms-fast cyclic correlation radar (FCCR) and digital mixing and down-sampling (DMD)- which significantly reduce system complexity while accurately estimating target range and velocity. We consider a realistic channel model where delays can take any value, not just integer multiples of the sampling period. This leads to a significantly larger number of effective paths compared to the actual number of targets, which makes the sensing, channel estimation, and interference cancellation more challenging. Leveraging the sensing results, we develop a sensing-aided effective channel estimation method which effectively reconstructs the channel under arbitrary delay condition based on successive interference cancellation and propose an interference cancellation scheme that removes the FMCW signal before the OFDM demodulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved channel estimation, and lower bit error rate (BER) compared to conventional OFDM systems with embedded pilots. The proposed scheme demonstrates superior BER performance in comparison to the conventional OFDM-plus-FMCW approach.</description>

      <title>Pilot design, channel estimation, and target detection for integrated sensing and communication with OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies shows that the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveform is a promising candidate for future communication. To meet users' potential demand for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) applications in 6G, the usage of OTFS for both radar sensing and wireless communication needs to be explored. In this paper, we propose a Fast Algorithm OTFS radar (FAOR) that can perform radar sensing in low complexity to detect the range and speed of the targets. It computes the 2D cyclic correlation of transmitted signal with the reordered delay Doppler (DD) domain received signals, and then generates the 2D range-Doppler map. It can be applied not only to monostatic radar but also to bistatic radar with a much lower computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art radar sensing technology. With the detected time delays and Doppler frequencies of the targets after the radar sensing, we propose a pilot-aided channel estimation method. The multifunction pilot symbol can serve the purpose of both bistatic radar sensing and channel estimation without any guard symbol added, while reducing the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) considerably compared to the conventional pilot design. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the compared algorithms and gives decent performance in both radar sensing and channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Iterative Hypothesis Pruning and Distribution-based Early Labeling for Sequential Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an active Decision-Maker (DM) is tasked to identify the true hypothesis using as few samples as possible while maintaining accuracy. The DM collects samples according to its determined actions and knows the distributions under each hypothesis. We propose the $\Phi$-$\Delta$ algorithm, a deterministic and adaptive multi-stage hypothesis-elimination algorithm where the DM selects an action, applies it repeatedly, and discards hypotheses in light of its obtained samples. The DM selects actions based on maximal separation expressed by the maximal minimal Total Variation Distance (TVD) between each two possible output distributions. To further optimize the search (in terms of the mean number of samples required to separate hypotheses), close distributions (in TVD) are clustered, and the algorithm eliminates whole clusters rather than individual hypotheses.
  We extensively analyze our algorithm and show it is asymptotically optimal as the desired error probability approaches zero. Our analysis also includes identifying instances when the algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the number of hypotheses, bounding the mean number of samples per-stage and in total, characterizing necessary and sufficient conditions for vanishing error rates when clustering hypotheses, evaluating algorithm complexity, and discussing its optimality in finite regimes.</description>

      <title>Improved Constructions of Linear Codes for Insertions and Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study linear error-correcting codes against adversarial insertion-deletion (indel) errors. While most constructions for the indel model are nonlinear, linear codes offer compact representations, efficient encoding, and decoding algorithms, making them highly desirable. A key challenge in this area is achieving rates close to the half-Singleton bound for efficient linear codes over finite fields. We improve upon previous results by constructing explicit codes over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\), linear over \(\mathbb{F}_q\), with rate \(1/2 - \delta - \varepsilon\) that can efficiently correct a \(\delta\)-fraction of indel errors, where \(q = O(\varepsilon^{-4})\). Additionally, we construct fully linear codes over \(\mathbb{F}_q\) with rate \(1/2 - 2\sqrt{\delta} - \varepsilon\) that can also efficiently correct \(\delta\)-fraction of indels. These results significantly advance the study of linear codes for the indel model, bringing them closer to the theoretical half-Singleton bound. We also generalize the half-Singleton bound, for every code \(C \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n\) linear over \(\mathbb{E} \subset \mathbb{F}\) a subfield of $\mathbb{F}$, such that \(C\) has the ability to correct \(\delta\)-fraction of indels, the rate is bounded by $(1-\delta)/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To increase the information capacity of DNA storage, composite DNA letters were introduced. We propose a novel channel model for composite DNA in which composite sequences are decomposed into ordered standard non-composite sequences. The model is designed to handle any alphabet size and composite resolution parameter. We study the problem of reconstructing composite sequences of arbitrary resolution over the binary alphabet under substitution errors. We define two families of error-correcting codes and provide lower and upper bounds on their cardinality. In addition, we analyze the case in which a single deletion error occurs in the channel and present a systematic code construction for this setting. Finally, we briefly discuss the channel's capacity, which remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Parameter Estimation in MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a joint communication and sensing setting comprising a transmitter, a receiver, and a sensor, all equipped with multiple antennas. The transmitter sends an encoded signal over the channel with the dual purpose of communicating an information message to the receiver, and enabling the sensor to estimate a target parameter vector by generating back-scattered signals. We assume that the transmitter and sensor are co-located, or fully connected, giving the latter access to the transmitted signal. The target parameter vector is randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, yet remains fixed throughout the transmission block. We establish the fundamental performance trade-off between the communication and sensing tasks, captured in terms of a capacity-MSE function. In doing so, we identify optimal coding schemes for this multi-antenna joint communication and sensing setting. Moreover, we particularize our result to two practically-inspired scenarios where we showcase optimal schemes and trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Private Information Retrieval over Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of PIR in graph-based replication systems has received significant attention in recent years. A systematic study was conducted by Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo, where each file is replicated across two servers and the storage topology is modeled by a graph. The PIR capacity of a graph $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{C}(G)$, is defined as the supremum of retrieval rates achievable by schemes that preserve user privacy, with the rate measured as the ratio between the file size and the total number of bits downloaded. This paper makes the following key contributions.
  (1) The complete graph $K_N$ has emerged as a central benchmark in the study of PIR over graphs. The asymptotic gap between the upper and lower bounds for $\mathcal{C}(K_N)$ was previously 2 and was only recently reduced to $5/3$. We shrink this gap to $1.0444$, bringing it close to resolution. More precisely,
  (i) Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo proved that $\mathcal{C}(K_N)\le 2/(N+1)$ and conjectured this bound to be tight. We refute this conjecture by establishing the strictly stronger bound $\mathcal{C}(K_N) \le \frac{1.3922}{N}.$ We also improve the upper bound for the balanced complete bipartite graph $\mathcal{C}(K_{N/2,N/2})$. (ii) The first lower bound on $\mathcal{C}(K_N)$ was $(1+o(1))/N$, which was recently sharpened to $(6/5+o(1))/N$. We provide explicit, systematic constructions that further improve this bound, proving $\mathcal{C}(K_N)\ge(4/3-o(1))/N,$ which in particular implies $\mathcal{C}(G) \ge (4/3-o(1))/|G|$ for every graph $G$.
  (2) We establish a conceptual bridge between deterministic and probabilistic PIR schemes on graphs. This connection has significant implications for reducing the required subpacketization in practical implementations and is of independent interest. We also design a general probabilistic PIR scheme that performs particularly well on sparse graphs.</description>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model degradation.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25656v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR), while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.</description>

      <title>A Unified Probabilistic Framework for Dictionary Learning with Parsimonious Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE) and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Beyond Point Estimates: Likelihood-Based Full-Posterior Wireless Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern wireless systems require not only position estimates, but also quantified uncertainty to support planning, control, and radio resource management. We formulate localization as posterior inference of an unknown transmitter location from receiver measurements. We propose Monte Carlo Candidate-Likelihood Estimation (MC-CLE), which trains a neural scoring network using Monte Carlo sampling to compare true and candidate transmitter locations. We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE learns critical properties including angular ambiguity and front-to-back antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss metric.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Rate Prediction for Multi-Band Cellular Handsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular wireless systems are witnessing the proliferation of frequency bands over a wide spectrum, particularly with the expansion of new bands in FR3. These bands must be supported in user equipment (UE) handsets with multiple antennas in a constrained form factor. Rapid variations in channel quality across the bands from motion and hand blockage, limited field-of-view of antennas, and hardware and power-constrained measurement sparsity pose significant challenges to reliable multi-band channel tracking. This paper formulates the problem of predicting achievable rates across multiple antenna arrays and bands with sparse historical measurements. We propose a transformer-based neural architecture that takes asynchronous rate histories as input and outputs per-array rate predictions. Evaluated on ray-traced simulations in a dense urban micro-cellular setting with FR1 and FR3 arrays, our method demonstrates superior performance over baseline predictors, enabling more informed band selection under realistic mobility and hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Think Less, Label Better: Multi-Stage Domain-Grounded Synthetic Data Generation for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models in Telecommunications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale, high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However, generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting, where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever, base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided Massive MIMO CSI Feedback: Exploring the Impact of Twinning Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated strong performance in compressing and reconstructing channel state information (CSI) while reducing feedback overhead in massive MIMO systems. A key challenge, however, is their reliance on extensive site-specific training data, whose real-world collection incurs significant overhead and limits scalability across deployment sites. To address this, we propose leveraging site-specific digital twins to assist the training of DL-based CSI compression models. The digital twin integrates an electromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment, a hardware model, and ray tracing to produce site-specific synthetic CSI data, allowing DL models to be trained without the need for extensive real-world measurements. We further develop a fidelity analysis framework that decomposes digital twin quality into four key aspects: 3D geometry, material properties, ray tracing, and hardware modeling. We explore how these factors influence the reliability of the data and model performance. To enhance the adaptability to real-world environments, we propose a refinement strategy that incorporates a limited amount of real-world data to fine-tune the DL model pre-trained on the digital twin dataset. Evaluation results show that models trained on site-specific digital twins outperform those trained on generic datasets, with the proposed refinement method effectively enhancing performance using limited real-world data. The simulations also highlight the importance of digital twin fidelity, especially in 3D geometry, ray tracing, and hardware modeling, for improving CSI reconstruction quality. This analysis framework offers valuable insights into the critical fidelity aspects, and facilitates more efficient digital twin development and deployment strategies for various wireless communication tasks.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Domain Channel Measurements and Modeling in High-Speed Railways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As next-generation wireless communication systems need to be able to operate in high-frequency bands and high-mobility scenarios, delay-Doppler (DD) domain multicarrier (DDMC) modulation schemes, such as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), demonstrate superior reliability over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Accurate DD domain channel modeling is essential for DDMC system design. However, since traditional channel modeling approaches are mainly confined to time, frequency, and space domains, the principles of DD domain channel modeling remain poorly studied. To address this issue, we propose a systematic DD domain channel measurement and modeling methodology in high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. First, we design a DD domain channel measurement method based on the long-term evolution for railway (LTE-R) system. Second, for DD domain channel modeling, we investigate quasi-stationary interval, statistical power modeling of multipath components, and particularly, the quasi-invariant intervals of DD domain channel fading coefficients. Third, via LTE-R measurements at 371 km/h, taking the quasi-stationary interval as the decision criterion, we establish DD domain channel models under different channel time-varying conditions in HSR scenarios. Fourth, the accuracy of proposed DD domain channel models is validated via bit error rate comparison of OTFS transmission. In addition, simulation verifies that in HSR scenario, the quasi-invariant interval of DD domain channel fading coefficient is on millisecond (ms) order of magnitude, which is much smaller than the quasi-stationary interval length on $100$ ms order of magnitude. This study could provide theoretical guidance for DD domain modeling in high-mobility environments, supporting future DDMC and integrated sensing and communication designs for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>EVODiff: Entropy-aware Variance Optimized Diffusion Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

      <title>A Generalized Information Bottleneck Theory of Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a \textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts. Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU} activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding of adversarial robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Fourier analysis, this paper establishes exact security bounds for linear extractors in True Random Number Generators (TRNGs). We provide the first near-optimal total variation security characterization by interpolating between optimal $\ell_{\infty}$ and $\ell_2$ norm results, expressed through code weight enumerators and input bias parameters. Our bounds improve security assessments by an order of magnitude over previous approximations. By scanning ~20,000 codes, we reveal fundamental trade-offs between compression efficiency and cryptographic security. For instance, we show that achieving 80 bits of security can require sacrificing more than 50\% of the code rate when correcting 10\% input bias. Our bounds enhance security evaluation of TRNG post-processing schemes and quantify the inherent cost of randomness extraction in hardware implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present noise-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (ND-NOMA), an innovative communication scheme that utilizes the modulation of artificial noise mean and variance to convey information. Distinct from traditional methods such as power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) that heavily rely on successive interference cancellation (SIC), ND-NOMA utilizes the noise domain, considerably reducing power consumption and system complexity. Inspired by noise modulation, ND-NOMA provides lower bit error probability (BEP), making it highly suitable for next-generation Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. Our theoretical analyses and computer simulations reveal that ND-NOMA can achieve exceptionally low bit error rates in both uplink and downlink scenarios, in the presence of Rician fading channels. The proposed multi-user system is supported by a minimum distance detector for mean detection and a threshold-based detector for variance detection, ensuring robust communication in low-power environments. By leveraging the inherent properties of noise, ND-NOMA offers a promising platform for long-term deployments of low-cost and low-complexity devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic Communication is becoming the next pillar in wireless communication technology due to its various capabilities. However, it still encounters various challenging obstacles that need to be solved before real-world deployment. One of which is the lack of standardization across different directions, resulting in variations in interpretation and objectives. In the survey, we provide detailed explanations of three leading directions in semantic communications, namely Theory of Mind, Generative AI, Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding. These directions have been widely studied, developed, and verified by institutes worldwide, and their effectiveness has increased along with the advancement in technology. We first introduce the concepts and background of these directions in the survey. Firstly, the survey introduces the Theory of Mind, where the communication agents interact with each other, gaining understanding from observations and slowly forming a common language. Secondly, we present generative AI models, which can create new content and offer more freedom to interpret the data beyond the limitation of semantic meaning compression of raw data before transmitting it. Thirdly, our survey reviews deep learning models to jointly optimize the source and channel coding modules. Then, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works in each direction, thereby offering readers an overview of past achievements and potential avenues for further contribution. Moreover, for each direction, the survey identifies and discusses the existing challenges that must be addressed before these approaches can be effectively deployed in real-world scenarios. These challenges encompass a range of technical, computational, and practical issues in the survey. Finally, this survey also explores emerging trends such as specifically quantum computing, in semantic communication is discussed in this survey.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Weighted Projection for Reliable Low-Complexity Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage weighted projection method (TS-WPM) for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization, providing provable improvements in positioning accuracy, particularly under high geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. TS-WPM employs a two-stage iterative refinement approach that dynamically updates both range and position estimates, effectively mitigating residual errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we extend TS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in scenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its error covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions for its optimality and robustness. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we develop a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant analytical framework, incorporating 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer aspects as well as large-scale and small-scale fading. As part of this, we derive a generalized Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath propagation and introduce a novel non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias model that accounts for propagation conditions and SNR variations. Our evaluations demonstrate that TS-WPM achieves near-CRLB performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) in high GDOP and low SNR scenarios. Moreover, cooperative localization with TS-WPM significantly enhances accuracy, especially when an insufficient number of anchors (such as 2) are visible. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of TS-WPM, showing its balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable solution for real-time localization in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Elias' Encoding from Lagrangians and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23447v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we give a derivation of Elias' Omega code from physics principles by combining a constrained variational formulation of prefix coding with a renormalization flow on codeword distributions.
  Starting from a Lagrangian that minimizes average codelength under the Kraft-McMillan constraint, we show that the implied distribution is a fixed point of a coarse-graining map, yielding the canonical iterated log-sum length, asymptotically up to an additive constant.
  This establishes completeness and asymptotic optimality, and connects universal integer coding with coarse-grained entropy, uncertainty-type bounds, and entropy relations familiar from statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing with Non-Homogeneous Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Non-Homogeneous Sequential Hypothesis Testing (NHSHT), where a single active Decision-Maker (DM) selects actions with heterogeneous positive costs to identify the true hypothesis under an average error constraint \(\delta\), while minimizing expected total cost paid. Under standard arguments, we show that the objective decomposes into the product of the mean number of samples and the mean per-action cost induced by the policy. This leads to a key design principle: one should optimize the ratio of expectations (expected information gain per expected cost) rather than the expectation of per-step information-per-cost ("bit-per-buck"), which can be suboptimal. We adapt the Chernoff scheme to NHSHT, preserving its classical \(\log 1/\delta\) scaling. In simulations, the adapted scheme reduces mean cost by up to 50\% relative to the classic Chernoff policy and by up to 90\% relative to the naive bit-per-buck heuristic.</description>

      <title>Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies for Winning Certain Coset-Guessing Quantum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recently introduced coset guessing game, Alice plays against Bob and Charlie, aiming to meet a joint winning condition. Bob and Charlie can only communicate before the game starts to devise a joint strategy. The game we consider begins with Alice preparing a 2m-qubit quantum state based on a random selection of three parameters. She sends the first m qubits to Bob and the rest to Charlie and then reveals to them her choice for one of the parameters. Bob is supposed to guess one of the hidden parameters, Charlie the other, and they win if both guesses are correct. From previous work, we know that the probability of Bob's and Charlie's guesses being simultaneously correct goes to zero exponentially as m increases. We derive a tight upper bound on this probability and show how Bob and Charlie can achieve it. While developing the optimal strategy, we devised an encoding circuit using only CNOT and Hadamard gates, which could be relevant for building efficient CSS-coded systems. We found that the role of quantum information that Alice communicates to Bob and Charlie is to make their responses correlated rather than improve their individual (marginal) correct guessing rates.</description>

      <title>Information-Geometric Barycenters for Bayesian Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used and impactful distributed optimization framework that achieves consensus through averaging locally trained models. While effective, this approach may not align well with Bayesian inference, where the model space has the structure of a distribution space. Taking an information-geometric perspective, we reinterpret FL aggregation as the problem of finding the barycenter of local posteriors using a prespecified divergence metric, minimizing the average discrepancy across clients. This perspective provides a unifying framework that generalizes many existing methods and offers crisp insights into their theoretical underpinnings. We then propose BA-BFL, an algorithm that retains the convergence properties of Federated Averaging in non-convex settings. In non-independent and identically distributed scenarios, we conduct extensive comparisons with statistical aggregation techniques, showing that BA-BFL achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a geometric interpretation of the aggregation phase. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning, exploring the impact of Bayesian layers on uncertainty quantification and model calibration.</description>

      <title>Winning Rates of $(n,k)$ Quantum Coset Monogamy Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game, in which two players must extract complementary information of unequal size ($k$ bits vs. $n-k$ bits) from a random coset state without communicating. The complementary information takes the form of random Pauli-X and Pauli-Z errors on subspace states. Our game generalizes those considered in previous works that deal with the case of equal information size $(k=n/2)$. We prove a convex upper bound of the information-theoretic winning rate of the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game in terms of the subspace rate $R=\frac{k}{n}\in [0,1]$. This bound improves upon previous results for the case of $R=1/2$. We also prove the achievability of an optimal winning probability upper bound for the class of unentangled strategies of the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game.</description>

      <title>DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</description>

      <title>Credible Uncertainty Quantification under Noise and System Model Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State estimators often provide self-assessed uncertainty metrics, such as covariance matrices, whose credibility is critical for downstream tasks. However, these self-assessments can be misleading due to underlying modeling violations like noise model mismatch (NMM) or system model misspecification (SMM). This letter addresses this problem by developing a unified, multi-metric framework that integrates noncredibility index (NCI), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and energy score (ES) metrics, featuring an empirical location test (ELT) to detect system model bias and a directional probing technique that uses the metrics' asymmetric sensitivities to distinguish NMM from SMM. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed method achieves excellent diagnosis accuracy (80-100%) and significantly outperforms single-metric diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated on a real-world UWB positioning dataset. This framework provides a practical tool for turning patterns of credibility indicators into actionable diagnoses of model deficiencies.</description>
