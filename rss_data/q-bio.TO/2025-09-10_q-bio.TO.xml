      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Epigallocatechin Gallate and Piperine on D. tigrina Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing global cancer burden necessitates exploration of effective and affordable treatments. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea catechin, and piperine, a black pepper alkaloid, have demonstrated promising anti-cancer properties. Leveraging the regenerative capacity of Dugesia tigrina (planaria) and their neoblast stem cells as a model for cancer growth, this study investigated the combined effects of EGCG and piperine on cell proliferation. Planaria were exposed to varying concentrations of EGCG and piperine over seven days, with growth changes recorded and compared to a negative control group. Initial trials identified optimal concentrations for growth inhibition, subsequently validated in a second trial using combined EGCG and piperine treatment. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in growth across all experimental groups (p &lt; 0.05), indicating a synergistic effect of EGCG and piperine in limiting planarian growth. These findings suggest the potential of combined EGCG and piperine therapy for cancer and other proliferative diseases like keloids and psoriatic arthritis, warranting further investigation into clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Towards automatizing detection and quantification of intestinal metaplasia: a multi-expert comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current gastric cancer risk systems are prone to errors since they evaluate a visual estimation of intestinal metaplasia percentages to assign a risk. This study presents an automated method to detect and quantify intestinal metaplasia using deep learning models as well as a comparative analysis with visual estimations of three experienced pathologists. Gastric samples were collected from two different cohorts: 149 asymptomatic volunteers from a region with a high prevalence of GCa in Colombia and 56 patients from a third-level hospital. Deep learning models were selected and trained to classify intestinal metaplasia, and predictions were used to estimate the percentage of intestinal metaplasia and assign the risk score. Results were compared with independent blinded assessments performed by three experienced pathologists. The best-performing deep learning architecture classified intestinal metaplasia with F1-Score of 0.80 +- 0.01 and AUC of 0.91 +- 0.01. Among pathologists, inter-observer agreement by a Fleiss's Kappa score ranged from 0.61 to 0.75. In comparison, agreement between the pathologists and the best-performing model ranged from 0.37 to 0.54. Deep learning models show potential to detect and quantify the percentage of intestinal metaplasia with greater precision and reproducibility than experienced pathologists. Likewise, estimated risk shows high inter-observer variability when visually assigning the intestinal metaplasia percentage.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Virtual Liver Biopsy Using Radiomics Analysis for the Assessment of Chronic Liver Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: The role of advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in chronic liver disease (CLD) has not been fully studied. Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a progressive deterioration of liver functions, caused by one or more etiology. This study was aimed to investigate whether radiomics features extracted from individual or combined magnetic resonance imaging sequences, such as T1-weighted, T2-weighted images, or quantitative maps from chemical shift encoded, diffusion-weighted imaging, can effectively classify inflammation and fibrosis in CLD. Method: Seventy-seven patients with CLD were enrolled in this study. Each participant underwent both MRI examinations and liver biopsy. The biopsy procedure was applied to quantitatively or semi-qualitatively analyze several histology features, steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Radiomic features were extracted, selected, reduced, and used to train the inflammation and fibrosis classification based on random forest models. The performances of classifiers were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and DeLong tests. Result: The random forest model achieved the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 and 0.86 for inflammation and fibrosis classification, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the MRI-based radiomics features hold potential in the inflammation and fibrosis classification.</description>
