      <title>Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for Crossing Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal driving of the ground state of a many-body quantum system across a quantum phase transition in finite time. In this context, excitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by adjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition. Drawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the timescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our analysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as Roland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic evolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an alternative, we introduce a novel framework, Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization (NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account the role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both local adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not restricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior performance in a disordered non-integrable model.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Spin Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices present a unique opportunity to venture beyond the conventional paradigm of crystalline many-body physics and explore correlated phenomena in negatively curved space. As a theoretical benchmark for such investigations, we extend Kitaev's spin-1/2 honeycomb model to hyperbolic lattices and exploit their non-Euclidean space-group symmetries to solve the model exactly. We elucidate the ground-state phase diagram on the $\{8,3\}$ lattice and find a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with Abelian anyons, a gapped chiral spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and chiral edge states, and a compressible spin liquid with low-energy density of states dominated by non-Abelian Bloch states of Majorana fermions.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Lack of Ferromagnetic Fluctuations Despite Ferromagnetic Substrate, with Commensurate Antiferromagnetic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations in the longitudinal and transversal spin susceptibilities of a square lattice. The inclusion of both first and second neighbour hopping terms, along with exchange coupling, induces anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations over a finite range of fillings in both longitudinal and transversal static spin susceptibilities. The exchange field causes a splitting of the energy bands, resulting in two Van Hove singularities where the Fermi surface topology changes as the filling passes through these points. In the absence of on-site Hubbard interaction, we observe incommensurate anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations between the two Van Hove fillings. Beyond the second Van Hove singularity at $ n=1.03 $, commensurate anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate in both longitudinal and transversal spin susceptibilities. When incorporating a finite Hubbard interaction strength, $ U $, we find that the commensurate anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations are preserved in both longitudinal and transversal dressed spin susceptibilities. However anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations vanish beyond a critical value of the Hubbard coupling strength, $ U_{c} $. Despite the exchange field can be induced by a ferromagnetic substrate, we do not observe any ferromagnetic fluctuations in the system.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect in quasi-1D Kondo chain CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ and its implications for hybridization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process how heavy-electron state is established in Kondo-lattice compounds remains an unsolved issue. Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy imply an intermediate regime with hybridization fluctuations prior to the establishment of Kondo coherence, which appears at odds with traditional transport measurements. Extensive experimental works are highly demanded to both reconcile this dichotomy and delineate the intrinsic features in this special regime. Here, on the example of quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we investigated angular dependent magnetotransport properties by planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements. Upon cooling from $T_K^{on}$ (an onset of incoherent Kondo scattering ) to below $T^*$ (where coherent $c$-$f$ hybridization comes into play), the two-fold symmetrical pattern of planar Hall effect changes sign gradually (i.e. $180^\circ$ phase shift); most strikingly, as a crossover, additional oscillations appear and persist until the heavy-electron state is stabilized below $T^*$. These results provide new insights for the regime of hybridization dynamics which might be deemed as a precursor state of the heavy-electron state.</description>

      <title>The Lugiato-Lefever equation driven by a double tightly focused pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of an optical cavity based on the one-dimensional Lugiato-Lefever (LL) equation, which includes the pump represented by a symmetric pair of tightly localized "hot spots" (HSs) with phase shift $\chi $ between them, and self-focusing or defocusing cubic nonlinearity. Families of bound states, pinned to the double HS, are found in the system's parameter space. They feature the effect of the symmetry breaking (SB) between peaks pinned to individual HSs, provided that the phase shift takes values $0&lt;\chi &lt;\pi $, and the LL equation includes the loss term. The SB, which is explained analytically, takes place in the full LL model and its linearized version alike. The same phenomenology is also explored in the framework of the LL equation with the double HS and quintic self-focusing. In that case, there are stable symmetric and asymmetric bound states, in spite of the presence of the background instability driven by the critical collapse.</description>

      <title>Coherence of a non-equilibrium polariton condensate across the interaction-mediated phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of spatial coherence in a confined two-dimensional Bose gas of exciton-polaritons with tuneable interactions offers a unique opportunity to explore the role of interactions in a phase transition in a driven-dissipative quantum system, where both the phase transition and thermalisation are mediated by interactions. We investigate, experimentally and numerically, the phase correlations and steady-state properties of the gas over a wide range of interaction strengths by varying the photonic/excitonic fraction of the polaritons and their density. We find that the first order spatial coherence function exhibits algebraic decay consistent with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition. Surprisingly, the exponent of the algebraic decay is inversely proportional to the coherent density of polaritons, in analogy to equilibrium superfluids above the BKT transition, but with a different proportionality constant. Our work paves the way for future investigations of the phenomenon of phase transitions and superfluidity in a driven-dissipative setting</description>

      <title>Quantum Advancements in Neutron Scattering Reshape Spintronic Devices</title>

Abstract: Topological magnetism has sparked an unprecedented age in quantum technologies. Marked by twisted spin structures with exotic dynamical modes, topological magnets have motivated a new generation of spintronic devices which transcend the limits of conventional semiconductor-based electronics. While existing material probes have biased studies and device conceptualizations for thin samples in two dimensions, advancements in three-dimensional probing techniques using beams of neutrons, are transforming our understanding of topological and emergent physics to reimagine spintronic devices. Here, we review recent neutron scattering breakthroughs which harness quantum degrees of freedom to enable three-dimensional topological investigations of quantum materials. We discuss applications of structured and tomographic neutron scattering techniques to topological magnets, with particular emphasis on magnetic skyrmion systems and their inspired three-dimensional logic device infrastructures through novel multi-bit encoding and control schemes. SANS-based dynamic visualizations and coherent manipulations of three-dimensional topological qubits are proposed using electric field controls of depth-dependant helicities and spin-orbit tuning of the neutron beam. Together, these investigations uncover a new world of three-dimensional topological physics which enhances spintronic devices through a novel set of structures, dynamics, and controls, unique to three-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>THz Control of Exchange Mode in a Ferrimagnetic Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of terahertz (THz) radiation with high-frequency spin resonances in complex magnetic materials is central for modern ultrafast magnonics. Here we demonstrate strong variations of the excitation efficiency of the sub-THz exchange magnon in a single crystal ferrimagnet (Gd,Bi)$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$. An enhancement of the exchange magnon amplitude is observed when its frequency matches an eigenmode of the cavity created by the sample interfaces. Moreover, this enhancement is accompanied by a 5-fold decrease in effective damping of the exchange mode. The THz-exchange magnon interaction in the cavity is analyzed within the developed Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert formalism for three coupled magnetization sublattices and cavity-enhanced THz field. This work presents a novel approach for the THz excitation of spin dynamics in ferrimagnets and outlines promising pathways for the controlled optimization of light-spin coupling in single crystals.</description>

      <title>Modeling Defect-Level Switching for Highly-Nonlinear and Hysteretic Electronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previously, we demonstrated hysteretic and persistent changes of resistivity in two-terminal electronic devices based on charge trapping and detrapping at immobile metastable defects [H. Yin, A. Kumar, J.M. LeBeau, and R. Jaramillo, Phys. Rev. Applied 15, 014014 (2021)]; we termed these devices as defect-level switching (DLS) devices. DLS devices feature all-electronic resistive switching and thus are volatile because of the voltage-time dilemma. However, the dynamics of volatile resistive switches may be valuable for emerging applications such as selectors in crosspoint memory, and neuromorphic computing concepts. To design memory and computing circuits using these volatile resistive switches, accurate modeling is essential. In this work we develop an accurate and analytical model to describe the switching physics in DLS devices, based on the established theories of point defect metastability in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and II-VI semiconductors. The analytical nature of our model allows for time-efficient simulations of dynamic behavior of DLS devices. We model the time durations of SET and RESET programming pulses, which can be exponentially shortened with respect to the pulse amplitude. We also demonstrate the concept of inverse design: given desired resistance states, the width and amplitude of the programming signal can be chosen accordingly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of topologically protected semi-metallic band crossings to hyperbolic lattices in a negatively curved plane. Because of their distinct translation group structure, such lattices are associated with a high-dimensional reciprocal space. In addition, they support non-Abelian Bloch states which, unlike conventional Bloch states, acquire a matrix-valued Bloch factor under lattice translations. Combining diverse numerical and analytical approaches, we uncover an unconventional scaling in the density of states at low energies, and illuminate a nodal manifold of codimension five in the reciprocal space. The nodal manifold is topologically protected by a nonzero second Chern number, reminiscent of the characterization of Weyl nodes by the first Chern number.</description>

      <title>Solitons with Self-induced Topological Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schrodinger equation supports solitons -- self-interacting, localized states that behave as nearly independent objects. We exhibit solitons with self-induced nonreciprocal dynamics in a discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This nonreciprocal behavior, dependent on soliton power, arises from the interplay between linear and nonlinear terms in the equations of motion. Initially stable at high power, solitons exhibit nonreciprocal instabilities as power decreases, leading to unidirectional acceleration and amplification. This behavior is topologically protected by winding numbers on the solitons' mean-field Hamiltonian and their stability matrix, linking nonlinear dynamics and point gap topology in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>
