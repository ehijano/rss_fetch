      <title>Schoenflies problem for area preserving biLipschitz mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any biLipschitz mapping of the boundary of the unit disk onto the boundary of the domain of the same area can be extended to a biLipschitz mapping of the whole plane which preserves the area of any measurable subset.</description>

      <title>Peripheral subgroups of Kleinian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformal boundary of a hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$ is a union of Riemann surfaces. If any of these Riemann surfaces has a nontrivial Teichm\"uller space, then the hyperbolic metric of $M$ can be deformed quasi-isometrically. These deformations correspond to a small pertubations in the matrices of the holonomy group of $M$, which together give an island of discrete representations around the identity map in $ X=\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(M), \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})) $. Determining the extent of this island is a hard problem. If $M$ is geometrically finite and its convex core boundary is pleated only along simple closed curves, then we cut up its conformal boundary in a way governed by the pleating combinatorics to produce a fundamental domain for $ \pi_1(M) $ that is combinatorially stable under small deformations, even those which change the pleated structure. We give a computable region in $X$, cut out by polynomial inequalities over $\mathbb{R}$, within which this fundamental domain is valid: all the groups in the region have peripheral structures that look `coarsely similar', in that they come from real-algebraically deforming a fixed conformal polygon and its side-pairings. The union of all these regions for different pleating laminations gives a countable cover, with sets of controlled topology, of the entire quasi-isometric deformation space of $ \pi_1(M) $ -- which is known to be topologically wild.</description>

      <title>New torsion patterns in Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper by the authors, we found some patterns in link diagrams that give rise to torsion elements of order two in their Khovanov homology. In this paper we extend these results by providing new torsion patterns. Many of the torsion elements found in this way have the same homological and quantum degrees; we identify a type of submodules of the Khovanov chain complex that allows us to prove that most of these torsion elements living in the same Khovanov module are really different.
  We use the results of this paper together with those in the previous one to find all the torsion elements in many small twists knots. In addition, we apply them to determine torsion elements in some families of pretzel links, closures of braids with three strands and rational links.</description>

      <title>2-cabling and tangle operators in Khovanov theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an operator on 4-ended tangles that is induced by 2-cabling of a strongly invertible knot. By passing to the 4-ended tangle Khovanov theory of Kotelskiy-Watson-Zibrowius, this induces an operator on the category of type D structures over the Bar-Natan algebra $\mathcal{B}$, as well as on a Fukaya category of the 4-punctured 2-sphere. We provide a full description of this operator's restriction to cap-trivial tangles. Finally, we extract geography results that are inspired by a recent concordance invariant of Lewark-Zibrowius.</description>

      <title>Holonomy of affine surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the moduli space of complex affine surfaces with the moduli space of regular meromorphic connections on Riemann surfaces and show that it satisfies a corresponding universal property. As a consequence, we identify the tangent space of the moduli space of affine surfaces, at an affine surface X, with the first hypercohomology of a two-term sequences of sheaves on X. In terms of this identification, we calculate the derivative and coderivative of the holonomy map, sending an affine surface to its holonomy character. Using these formulas, we show that the holonomy map is a submersion at every affine surface that is not a finite-area translation surface, extending work of Veech. Finally, we introduce a holomorphic foliation of some strata of meromorphic affine surfaces, which we call the isoresidual foliation, along whose leave holonomy characters and certain residues are constant. We equip this foliation with a leafwise indefinite Hermitian metric, again extending work of Veech.</description>

      <title>Dudeney's Dissection is Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1907, Henry Ernest Dudeney posed a puzzle: ``cut any equilateral triangle \dots\ into as few pieces as possible that will fit together and form a perfect square'' (without overlap, via translation and rotation).
  Four weeks later, Dudeney demonstrated a beautiful four-piece solution, which today remains perhaps the most famous example of dissection.
  In this paper (over a century later), we finally solve Dudeney's puzzle, by proving that the equilateral triangle and square have no common dissection with three or fewer polygonal pieces.
  We reduce the problem to the analysis of discrete graph structures representing the correspondence between the edges and the vertices of the pieces forming each polygon.</description>
