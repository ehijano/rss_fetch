      <title>Angle-of-arrival detection of radio-frequency waves via Rydberg atom fluorescence imaging of standing waves in a glass vapor cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for measuring the angle-of-arrival of 40 GHz radio-frequency (RF) radiation by mapping the standing waves generated in a rectangular glass vapor cell. These standing waves have regular and well-defined structure from which we can infer the angle and sign of the wavevector of the RF field. We map the field using spatially resolved light sheet spectroscopy of Rydberg states of rubidium atoms in the cell. Unlike traditional phased arrays, this detection scheme is compact and low-complexity, has an active area of nearly 4$\pi$ steradians, and is sensitive to all RF polarizations. For in-plane measurements ($\phi = 0$), we demonstrate quantitative angle-of-arrival measurements with an uncertainty on the order of one degree in an 11~s measurement, and for out-of-plane measurements (arbitrary $\theta$,$\phi$), we demonstrate angle-of-arrival detection with uncertainty on the order of several degrees.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of fast heavy noble gas atoms, Ar, Kr and Xe on a LiF(001) surface Changing the tip of a 'perfect' AFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate experimentally the diffraction of fast atoms of noble gas on a LiF(100) crystal oriented along the [100] and [110] directions. The wavelengths are so short that the observed quantum features are qualitatively described by semi-classical models.
  With increasing mass and energy, the scattering profiles show an increasing number of diffraction peaks forming an increasing number of supernumerary rainbow peaks but progressively weakening in contrast. The innermost peaks corresponding to individual Bragg peaks disappear first. Along the [100] direction, only one type of atomic row contributes to the diffraction signal. After removing the contributions of the attractive forces, we present topological corrugation that should compare with those accessible with an atomic force microscope (AFM).</description>

      <title>300 {\mu}s optical cavity storage time and $\mathbf{10^{-7}}$ active RAM cancellation for $\mathbf{10^{-19}}$ laser frequency stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency stabilisation of lasers to optical reference cavities is an established method to achieve state-of-the-art stability. The strengths of this method are the high discriminator coefficient of optical cavities, and the low-noise extraction of the stabilisation signal using modulation techniques. In this Letter we report beyond state-of-the-art performance on both of these fundamentals, unlocking $10^{-19}$ fractional frequency laser stabilisation. We employ a 68 cm long cavity to realise an optical storage time of 300 microseconds, achieving ultrahigh frequency discrimination. We develop a simple and robust scheme to actively cancel residual amplitude modulation (RAM) at the $10^{-7}$ level in an annealed-proton-exchanged lithium-niobate waveguide electro-optic-modulator (EOM).</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Single Organic Radicals with Sub-Molecular Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in the magnetism of organic compounds is growing because of new organic magnets, spin-based electronics and the diverse properties of magnetic edge states in graphene nanoribbons. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy combined with the scanning tunneling microscopy has recently been developed as a powerful tool to address individual magnetic atoms and molecules at the atomic scale. Here we demonstrate electron spin resonance and magnetic resonance imaging of all-organic radical anions adsorbed on a protective thin insulating film grown on a metal support. We show that using the highly localized exchange field of the magnetic tip apex allows visualization of the delocalized spin density with sub-molecular resolution, enabling spin-density tomography that can distinguish similar molecular species. These results provide new opportunities for visualizing spin density and magnetic interactions at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Controlling the sign of optical forces using metaoptics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise manipulation of small objects using light holds transformative potential across diverse fields. While research in optical trapping and manipulation predominantly relies on the attraction of solid matter to light intensity maxima, here we demonstrate that meta-optics enables a departure from this accepted behavior. Specifically, we present deterministic control over the sign of optical forces exerted on a metasurface integrated on a suspended silicon nanomembrane. By tailoring the geometry of the constituent meta-atoms, we engineer the coherent superposition of their multipolar modes, and consequently, the net optical force experienced by the metasurface within a phase-controlled optical standing wave. In excellent agreement with 3D numerical simulations, we experimentally realize both attractive and repulsive forces on distinct metasurface designs, directly mirroring the behavior of two-level systems interacting with optical fields. This work establishes a versatile platform for the optical control of nanoscale mechanical systems, opening new avenues for both fundamental research and engineering.</description>

      <title>Nondegenerate, Lamb-shift Solution of the Dirac Hydrogen Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the Dirac equation was first published in 1928, three solutions appeared immediately within the same year, each describing the most important problem in physics at that time: the hydrogen atom. These solutions lifted some of the degeneracy from earlier atomic models, but not all of it--they still predicted the same degenerate energy levels for the 2s1/2 and 2p1/2 states, for example. In this paper, we introduce a new solution of the Dirac equation, which finally removes all degeneracy from the hydrogen atom. We work in terms of dimensionless quantities and use the Lamb shift to give each atomic state in our model a unique, nondegenerate energy level. We obtain radial eigenfunctions in terms of the Laguerre polynomials, demonstrate how they can be reduced to the Schrodinger wavefunctions by applying limits, and plot our results.</description>

      <title>On the Excess Charge Problem of Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes new bounds on the maximum number of electrons $ N_c(Z) $ that an atom with nuclear charge $Z$ can bind. Specifically, we show that \begin{equation*}
  N_c(Z) &lt; 1.1185Z + O(Z^{1/3}) \end{equation*} with an explicit bound on the lower order term $O(Z^{1/3})$. This result improves long--standing bounds by Lieb and Nam obtained in 1984, respectively 2012. Our bounds show the fundamental difference between fermionic and bosonic atoms for finite $Z$ since for bosonic atoms it is known that $\lim N_c(Z)/Z = t_c \approx 1.21$ in the limit of large nuclear charges $Z$.</description>

      <title>Atoms in hollow-core fibers: A QED approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline mechanical effects of light-matter interaction inside hollow-core optical fibers. Starting with quantized electromagnetic radiation, we demonstrate how dispersion, mode functions and losses define an open quantum system and how subsequent Langevin equations can be used to predict spatially-dependent vacuum forces. Conceptually, we reveal new, geometry-induced, forces that have no equivalence in unbounded 3-D space and, practically, show how the general spatial dependence can be greatly approximated by free-space Ince-Gaussian modes: such that the forces can be described analytically. By also considering the effects of drive and fluctuations, we provide an extensive overview of both control and cooling within the limitations of a 2-level atomic system.</description>

      <title>Probing Hilbert Space Fragmentation with Strongly Interacting Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a feasible scheme to explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.</description>

      <title>A Trade-Off Between Path Entanglement and Quantum Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement often increases quantum measurement schemes' sensitivity. However, we find that in precision measurements with zero-mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed states, entanglement between different paths degrades measurement sensitivity. We prove an inverse relationship between entanglement entropy and sensitivity for measurements of single-mode phase shifts in multimode systems and for phase shifts on both modes in two-mode systems. In the two-mode case, which models devices such as interferometers, we find that entanglement strongly degrades differential phase sensitivity. Finally, we show that minimizing entanglement between paths maximizes the phase sensitivity of $N$-mode systems with zero-mean Gaussian state inputs.</description>
