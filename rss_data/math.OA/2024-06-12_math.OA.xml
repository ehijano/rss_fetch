      <title>Bijections Between Sets of Invariant Ideals, Via the Ladder Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method of establishing a bijective correspondence - in fact, a lattice isomorphism - between action- and coaction-invariant ideals of C*-algebras and their crossed products by a fixed locally compact group. It is known that such a correspondence exists whenever the group is amenable; our results hold for any locally compact group under a natural form of coaction invariance.</description>

      <title>On the Bures metric, C*-norm, and the quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the topology on the density space with respect to a unital C*-algebra and a faithful induced by the C*-norm is finer than the Bures metric topology. We also provide an example when this containment is strict. Next, we provide a metric on the density space induced by a quantum metric in the sense of Rieffel and prove that the induced topology is the same as the topology induced by the Bures metric and C*-norm when the C*-algebra is assumed to be finite dimensional. Finally, we provide an example of when the Bures metric and induced quantum metric are not metric equivalent. Thus, we provide a bridge between these aspects of quantum information theory and noncommutative metric geometry.</description>

      <title>Heat operators and isometry groups of Cuntz-Krieger algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces heat semigroups of topological Markov chains and Cuntz-Krieger algebras by means of spectral noncommutative geometry. Using recent advances on the logarithmic Dirichlet Laplacian on Ahlfors regular metric-measure spaces, we construct spectral triples on Cuntz-Krieger algebras from singular integral operators. These spectral triples exhaust K-homology and for Cuntz algebras we can compute their heat operators explicitly as Riesz potential operators. We also describe their isometry group in terms of the automorphism group of the underlying directed graph and prove that the Voiculescu noncommutative topological entropy vanishes on isometries.</description>

      <title>Banach algebras associated to twisted \'{e}tale groupoids: simplicity and pure infiniteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define reduced and essential Banach algebras associated to a twisted \'{e}tale (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ and extend some fundamental results from $C^*$-algebras to this context. For instance, we prove that for topologically free and minimal groupoids every essential Banach algebra is simple, and we give conditions under which reduced algebras are essential (for example Hausdorffness of $\mathcal{G}$ is sufficient). This in particular solves the simplicity problem posed recently by Gardella-Lupini for $L^p$-operator algebras associated to $\mathcal{G}$. In addition, using either the $n$-filling or locally contracting condition we give pure infiniteness criteria for essential simple Banach algebras associated to $(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$. This extends the corresponding $C^*$-algebraic results that were previously known to hold in the untwisted Hausdorff case. The results work nicely, and allow for characterisation of the generalized intersection property, in the realm of $L^P$-operator algebras where $P \subseteq [1,\infty]$ is a non-empty set of parameters. Such algebras cover in particular $L^p$-operator algebras, for $p\in [1,\infty]$, and their Banach $*$-algebra versions.
  We apply our results to Banach algebra crossed products by twisted partial group actions, Roe-type Banach algebras with coefficients in finite-rank operators on a Banach space, twisted tight $L^P$-operator algebras of inverse semigroups, graph $L^P$-operator algebras, and algebras associated to self-similar group actions on graphs. We also interpret our results in terms of twisted inverse semigroup actions and their crossed products.</description>

      <title>Solving the index problem for (curved) Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the index theory of curved Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) sequences in parabolic geometry and their role in $K$-homology and noncommutative geometry. The BGG-sequences fit into $K$-homology, and we solve their index problem. We provide a condition for when the BGG-complex on the flat parabolic geometry $G/P$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$ fits into $G$-equivariant $K$-homology by means of Heisenberg calculus. For higher rank Lie groups, we prove a no-go theorem showing that the approach fails.</description>

      <title>A Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'{a}s theorem for bounded analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H^\infty$ denote the Banach algebra of all bounded analytic functions on the open unit disc and denote by $\mathscr{B}(H^\infty)$ the Banach space of all bounded linear operators from $H^\infty$ to itself. We prove that the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'{a}s property holds for $\mathscr{B}(H^\infty)$. As an application to our approach, we prove that the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'{a}s property also holds for operator ideals of $\mathscr{B}(H^\infty)$.</description>
