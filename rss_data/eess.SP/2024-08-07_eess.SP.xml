      <title>Recent Advances in Data-driven Intelligent Control for Wireless Communication: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation wireless communication systems heralds an era characterized by high data rates, low latency, massive connectivity, and superior energy efficiency. These systems necessitate innovative and adaptive strategies for resource allocation and device behavior control in wireless networks. Traditional optimization-based methods have been found inadequate in meeting the complex demands of these emerging systems. As the volume of data continues to escalate, the integration of data-driven methods has become indispensable for enabling adaptive and intelligent control mechanisms in future wireless communication systems. This comprehensive survey explores recent advancements in data-driven methodologies applied to wireless communication networks. It focuses on developments over the past five years and their application to various control objectives within wireless cyber-physical systems. It encompasses critical areas such as link adaptation, user scheduling, spectrum allocation, beam management, power control, and the co-design of communication and control systems. We provide an in-depth exploration of the technical underpinnings that support these data-driven approaches, including the algorithms, models, and frameworks developed to enhance network performance and efficiency. We also examine the challenges that current data-driven algorithms face, particularly in the context of the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of next-generation wireless networks. The paper provides a critical analysis of these challenges and offers insights into potential solutions and future research directions. This includes discussing the adaptability, integration with 6G, and security of data-driven methods in the face of increasing network complexity and data volume.</description>

      <title>LLM-Empowered Resource Allocation in Wireless Communications Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has spurred their application in various fields. In particular, there have been efforts to integrate LLMs into various aspects of wireless communication systems. The use of LLMs in wireless communication systems has the potential to realize artificial general intelligence (AGI)-enabled wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate an LLM-based resource allocation scheme for wireless communication systems. Specifically, we formulate a simple resource allocation problem involving two transmit pairs and develop an LLM-based resource allocation approach that aims to maximize either energy efficiency or spectral efficiency. Additionally, we consider the joint use of low-complexity resource allocation techniques to compensate for the reliability shortcomings of the LLM-based scheme. After confirming the applicability and feasibility of LLM-based resource allocation, we address several key technical challenges that remain in applying LLMs in practice.</description>

      <title>Damage identification for bridges using machine learning: Development and application to KW51 bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, structural health monitoring (SHM) has drawn significant attention to identifying damage in structures. However, there are open challenges related to the efficiency and applicability of the existing damage identification approaches. This paper proposes an effective approach that integrates both modal analysis and dynamic analysis strategies for damage identification and applies it to the KW51 railway bridge in Leuven, Belgium. The ML-based damage identification utilizes four types of features: modal analysis input, frequency characteristics, time-frequency characteristics, and stacked time series feature extraction from forced acceleration response. Signal processing methods such as stacking, Fourier transform, and wavelet transform are employed to extract damage-sensitive features from the acceleration series. The ML methods, including the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm, stacked gated recurrent unit (stacked GRU) network, and convolutional neural network (CNN), are then combined to assess the existence, extent, and location of damage. The proposed method is applied to the KW51 railway bridge. A finite element model (FEM) of the KW51 bridge is developed, which is validated by modal analysis. Various extents and locations of damage are simulated to generate the "Damaged" data, while the "Intact" data from FEM or measured data serve as a baseline for comparison. The identification results for the KW51 bridge demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach, confirming its effectiveness in damage identification problems.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Jamming Attack on 5G NR Physical Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the jamming attack on the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based physical channels in 5G new radio (NR) technology from the aspect of signal processing. Disrupting the orthogonality property between subcarriers (SCs) is considered as one of the jammers targets in OFDM based generations. Focusing on the orthogonality property, we propose a method to detect the attacked subcarriers, and then neutralize the jamming attack using a multiplicative signal. Thanks to studying the frequency aspect of the attacked signal, the proposed method is independent of the jammers transmitted power. Simulation results evaluate the detection performance of the proposed method with various numbers of OFDM subcarriers.</description>

      <title>Coherent FDA Radar: Transmitter and Receiver Design and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of frequency diverse array (FDA) radar technology with the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar architecture and waveform diversity techniques potentially promises a high integration gain with respect to conventional phased array (PA) radars. In this paper, we propose an approach to the design of the transmitter and the receiver of a coherent FDA (C-FDA) radar, that enables it to perform the demodulation with spectral overlapping, due to the small frequency offset. To this purpose, we derive the generalized space-time-range signal model and we prove that the proposed C-FDA radar has a higher coherent array gain than a PA radar, and at the same time, it effectively resolves the secondary range-ambiguous (SRA) problem of FDA-MIMO radar, allowing for mainlobe interference suppression and range-ambiguous clutter suppression. Numerical analysis results prove the effectiveness of the proposed C-FDA radar in terms on anti-interference and anti-clutter capabilities over conventional radars.</description>

      <title>FDA Jamming Against Airborne Phased-MIMO Radar-Part I: Matched Filtering and Spatial Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phased multiple-input multiple-output (Phased-MIMO) radar has received increasing attention for enjoying the advantages of waveform diversity and range-dependency from frequency diverse array MIMO (FDA-MIMO) radar without sacrificing coherent processing gain through partitioning transmit subarray. This two-part series proposes a framework of electronic countermeasures (ECM) inspired by frequency diverse array (FDA) radar, called FDA jamming, evaluating its effectiveness for countering airborne phased-MIMO radar. This part introduces the principles and categories of FDA jammer and proposes the FDA jamming signal model based on the two cases of phased-MIMO radar, phased-array (PA) radar and FDA-MIMO radar. Moreover, the effects of FDA jamming on matched filtering and spatial filtering of PA and FDA-MIMO radar are analyzed. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis and validate the effectiveness of the proposed FDA jamming in countering phased-MIMO radar.</description>

      <title>FDA Jamming Against Airborne Phased-MIMO Radar-Part II: Jamming STAP Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first part of this series introduced the effectiveness of frequency diverse array (FDA) jamming through direct wave propagation in countering airborne phased multiple-input multiple-output (Phased-MIMO) radar. This part focuses on the effectiveness of FDA scattered wave (FDA-SW) jamming on the space-time adaptive processing (STAP) for airborne phased-MIMO radar. Distinguished from the clutter signals, the ground equidistant scatterers of FDA-SW jamming constitute an elliptical ring, whose trajectory equations are mathematically derived to further determine the spatial frequency and Doppler frequency. For the phased-MIMO radar with different transmitting partitions, the effects of jamming frequency offset of FDA-SW on the clutter rank and STAP performance are discussed. Theoretical analysis provides the variation interval of clutter rank and the relationship between the jamming frequency offset and the improvement factor (IF) notch of phased-MIMO-STAP. Importantly, the requirements of jamming frequency offset for both two-part applications are discussed in this part. Numerical results verify these mathematical findings and validate the effectiveness of the proposed FDA jamming in countering the phased-MIMO radar.</description>

      <title>A Graph Signal Processing Perspective of Network Multiple Hypothesis Testing with False Discovery Rate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multiple hypothesis testing problem in a sensor network over the joint spatial-time domain. The sensor network is modeled as a graph, with each vertex representing a sensor and a signal over time associated with each vertex. We assume a hypothesis test and an associated p-value for every sample point in the joint spatial-time domain. Our goal is to determine which points have true alternative hypotheses. By parameterizing the unknown alternative distribution of $p$-values and the prior probabilities of hypotheses being null with a bandlimited generalized graph signal, we can obtain consistent estimates for them. Consequently, we also obtain an estimate of the local false discovery rates (lfdr). We prove that by using a step-up procedure on the estimated lfdr, we can achieve asymptotic false discovery rate control at a pre-determined level. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmission and Compression Design for 6G Networked Sensing with Limited-Capacity Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers networked sensing in cellular network, where multiple base stations (BSs) first compress their received echo signals from multiple targets and then forward the quantized signals to the cloud via limited-capacity backhaul links, such that the cloud can leverage all useful echo signals to perform high-resolution localization. Under this setup, we manage to characterize the posterior Cramer-Rao Bound (PCRB) for localizing all the targets as a function of the transmit covariance matrix and the compression noise covariance matrix of each BS. Then, a PCRB minimization problem subject to the transmit power constraints and the backhaul capacity constraints is formulated to jointly design the BSs' transmission and compression strategies. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve this problem based on the alternating optimization technique. Specifically, it is shown that when either the transmit covariance matrices or the compression noise covariance matrices are fixed, the successive convex approximation technique can be leveraged to optimize the other type of covariance matrices locally. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Artificial Neural Networks for Photonic Applications: From Algorithms to Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial-review on applications of artificial neural networks in photonics targets a broad audience, ranging from optical research and engineering communities to computer science and applied mathematics. We focus here on the research areas at the interface between these disciplines, attempting to find the right balance between technical details specific to each domain and overall clarity. First, we briefly recall key properties and peculiarities of some core neural network types, which we believe are the most relevant to photonics, also linking the layer's theoretical design to some photonics hardware realizations. After that, we elucidate the question of how to fine-tune the selected model's design to perform the required task with optimized accuracy. Then, in the review part, we discuss recent developments and progress for several selected applications of neural networks in photonics, including multiple aspects relevant to optical communications, imaging, sensing, and the design of new materials and lasers. In the following section, we put a special emphasis on how to accurately evaluate the complexity of neural networks in the context of the transition from algorithms to hardware implementation. The introduced complexity characteristics are used to analyze the applications of neural networks in optical communications, as a specific, albeit highly important example, comparing those with some benchmark signal processing methods. We combine the description of the well-known model compression strategies used in machine learning, with some novel techniques introduced recently in optical applications of neural networks. It is important to stress that although our focus in this tutorial-review is on photonics, we believe that the methods and techniques presented here can be handy in a much wider range of scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Automatic Voice Identification after Speech Resynthesis using PPG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech resynthesis is a generic task for which we want to synthesize audio with another audio as input, which finds applications for media monitors and journalists.Among different tasks addressed by speech resynthesis, voice conversion preserves the linguistic information while modifying the identity of the speaker, and speech edition preserves the identity of the speaker but some words are modified.In both cases, we need to disentangle speaker and phonetic contents in intermediate representations.Phonetic PosteriorGrams (PPG) are a frame-level probabilistic representation of phonemes, and are usually considered speaker-independent.This paper presents a PPG-based speech resynthesis system.A perceptive evaluation assesses that it produces correct audio quality.Then, we demonstrate that an automatic speaker verification model is not able to recover the source speaker after re-synthesis with PPG, even when the model is trained on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Learned Trimmed-Ridge Regression for Channel Estimation in Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel estimation poses significant challenges in millimeter-wave massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, especially when the base station has fewer radio-frequency chains than antennas. To address this challenge, one promising solution exploits the beamspace channel sparsity to reconstruct full-dimensional channels from incomplete measurements. This paper presents a model-based deep learning method to reconstruct sparse, as well as approximately sparse, vectors fast and accurately. To implement this method, we propose a trimmed-ridge regression that transforms the sparse-reconstruction problem into a least-squares problem regularized by a nonconvex penalty term, and then derive an iterative solution. We then unfold the iterations into a deep network that can be implemented in online applications to realize real-time computations. To this end, an unfolded trimmed-ridge regression model is constructed using a structural configuration to reduce computational complexity and a model ensemble strategy to improve accuracy. Compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning models, the proposed learning scheme achieves better accuracy and supports higher downlink sum rates.</description>

      <title>Towards Smart Microfarming in an Urban Computing Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microfarming and urban computing have evolved as two distinct sustainability pillars of urban living today. In this paper, we combine these two concepts, while majorly extending them jointly towards novel concepts of smart microfarming and urban computing continuum. Smart microfarming is proposed with applications of artificial intelligence in microfarming, while an urban computing continuum is proposed as a major extension of the concept towards an efficient IoT-edge-cloud continuum. We propose and build a system architecture for a plant recommendation system that uses machine learning at the edge to find, from a pool of given plants, the most suitable ones for a given microfarm using monitored soil values obtained from IoT sensor devices. Moreover, we propose to integrate long-distance LoRa communication solution for sending the data from IoT to the edge system, due to its unlicensed nature and potential for open source implementations. Finally, we propose to integrate open source and less constrained application protocol solutions, such as AMQP and HTTP protocols, for storing the data in the cloud. An experimental setup is used to evaluate and analyze the performance and reliability of the data collection procedure and the quality of the recommendation solution. Furthermore, collaborative filtering is used for the completion of an incomplete information about soils and plants. Finally, various ML algorithms are applied to identify and recommend the optimal plan for a specific microfarm in an urban area.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Partially-Calibrated Sparse Subarrays for Direction Finding with Extended Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using multiple partially-calibrated sparse subarrays. In particular, we present the Generalized Coarray Multiple Signal Classification (GCA-MUSIC) DOA estimation algorithm to scenarios with partially-calibrated sparse subarrays. The proposed GCA-MUSIC algorithm exploits the difference coarray for each subarray, followed by a specific pseudo-spectrum merging rule that is based on the intersection of the signal subspaces associated to each subarray. This rule assumes that there is no a priori knowledge about the cross-covariance between subarrays. In that way, only the second-order statistics of each subarray are used to estimate the directions with increased degrees of freedom, i.e., the estimation procedure preserves the coarray Multiple Signal Classification and sparse arrays properties to estimate more sources than the number of physical sensors in each subarray. Numerical simulations show that the proposed GCA-MUSIC has better performance than other similar strategies.</description>

Abstract: Study Objectives: Polysomnography (PSG) currently serves as the benchmark for evaluating sleep disorders. Its discomfort makes long-term monitoring unfeasible, leading to bias in sleep quality assessment. Hence, less invasive, cost-effective, and portable alternatives need to be explored. One promising contender is the in-ear-EEG sensor. This study aims to establish a methodology to assess the similarity between the single-channel in-ear-EEG and standard PSG derivations.
  Methods: The study involves four-hour signals recorded from ten healthy subjects aged 18 to 60 years. Recordings are analyzed following two complementary approaches: (i) a hypnogram-based analysis aimed at assessing the agreement between PSG and in-ear-EEG-derived hypnograms; and (ii) a feature-based analysis based on time- and frequency- domain feature extraction, unsupervised feature selection, and definition of Feature-based Similarity Index via Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD-FSI).
  Results: We find large variability between PSG and in-ear-EEG hypnograms scored by the same sleep expert according to Cohen's kappa metric, with significantly greater agreements for PSG scorers than for in-ear-EEG scorers (p &lt; 0.001) based on Fleiss' kappa metric. On average, we demonstrate a high similarity between PSG and in-ear-EEG signals in terms of JSD-FSI (0.79 +/- 0.06 -awake, 0.77 +/- 0.07 -NREM, and 0.67 +/- 0.10 -REM) and in line with the similarity values computed independently on standard PSG-channel-combinations.
  Conclusions: In-ear-EEG is a valuable solution for home-based sleep monitoring, however further studies with a larger and more heterogeneous dataset are needed.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gait Abnormalities in Foot-Floor Contacts During Walking Through Footstep-Induced Structural Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gait abnormality detection is critical for the early discovery and progressive tracking of musculoskeletal and neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's and Cerebral Palsy. Especially, analyzing the foot-floor contacts during walking provides important insights into gait patterns, such as contact area, contact force, and contact time, enabling gait abnormality detection through these measurements. Existing studies use various sensing devices to capture such information, including cameras, wearables, and force plates. However, the former two lack force-related information, making it difficult to identify the causes of gait health issues, while the latter has limited coverage of the walking path. In this study, we leverage footstep-induced structural vibrations to infer foot-floor contact profiles and detect gait abnormalities. The main challenge lies in modeling the complex force transfer mechanism between the foot and the floor surfaces, leading to difficulty in reconstructing the force and contact profile during foot-floor interaction using structural vibrations. To overcome the challenge, we first characterize the floor vibration for each contact type (e.g., heel, midfoot, and toe contact) to understand how contact forces and areas affect the induced floor vibration. Then, we leverage the time-frequency response spectrum resulting from those contacts to develop features that are representative of each contact type. Finally, gait abnormalities are detected by comparing the predicted foot-floor contact force and motion with the healthy gait. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a real-world walking experiment with 8 subjects. Our approach achieves 91.6% and 96.7% accuracy in predicting contact type and time, respectively, leading to 91.9% accuracy in detecting various types of gait abnormalities, including asymmetry, dragging, and midfoot/toe contacts.</description>

      <title>High-SNR Comparison of Linear Precoding and DPC in RIS-Aided MIMO Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare dirty paper coding (DPC) and linear precoding methods in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)- aided high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario, where the channel between the base station (BS) and the RIS is dominated by a line-of-sight (LOS) component. Furthermore, we consider two groups of users where one group can be efficiently served by the BS, whereas the other one has a negligible direct channel and has to be served via the RIS. Within this scenario, we analytically show fundamental differences between DPC and linear methods. In particular, our analysis addresses two essential aspects, i.e., the orthogonality of the BS-RIS channel with the direct channel and a channel mitigation term, depending on the number of RIS elements, that is present only for linear precoding techniques. The mitigation term generally leads to strong limitations for the linear method, especially for random or statistical phase shifts. Moreover, we discuss under which circumstances this mitigation term is negligible and in which scenarios DPC and linear precoding lead to the same performance.</description>

      <title>Variation Bayesian Interference for Multiple Extended Targets or Unresolved Group Targets Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a tracking method for multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets based on the Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI). Firstly, based on the most commonly used Random Matrix Model (RMM), the joint states of a single target are modeled as a Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart (GGIW) distribution, and the multi-target joint association variables are involved in the estimation together as unknown information with a prior distribution. A shape evolution model and VBI are employed to address the shortcomings of the RMM. Through the VBI, we can derive the approximate variational posterior for the exact multi-target posterior. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of the method in real-world tracking scenarios, we present two potential lightweight schemes. The first is based on clustering, which effectively prunes the joint association events. The second is a simplification of the variational posterior through marginal association probabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using simulation experiments, and the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and adaptability. This manuscript is only a preprint version, a completer and more official version will be uploaded as soon as possible</description>

      <title>On the Identifiability from Modulo Measurements under DFT Sensing Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modulo sampling (MS) has been recently introduced to enhance the dynamic range of conventional ADCs by applying a modulo operator before sampling. This paper examines the identifiability of a measurement model where measurements are taken using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) sensing matrix, followed by a modulo operator (modulo-DFT). Firstly, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the unique identification of the modulo-DFT sensing model based on the number of measurements and the indices of zero elements in the original signal. Then, we conduct a deeper analysis of three specific cases: when the number of measurements is a power of $2$, a prime number, and twice a prime number. Additionally, we investigate the identifiability of periodic bandlimited (PBL) signals under MS, which can be considered as the modulo-DFT sensing model with additional symmetric and conjugate constraints on the original signal. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition based solely on the number of samples in one period for the unique identification of the PBL signal under MS, though with an ambiguity in the direct current (DC) component. Furthermore, we show that when the oversampling factor exceeds $3(1+1/P)$, the PBL signal can be uniquely identified with an ambiguity in the DC component, where $P$ is the number of harmonics, including the fundamental component, in the positive frequency part. Finally, we also present a recovery algorithm that estimates the original signal by solving integer linear equations, and we conduct simulations to validate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>MVGT: A Multi-view Graph Transformer Based on Spatial Relations for EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), a medical imaging technique that captures scalp electrical activity of brain structures via electrodes, has been widely used in affective computing. The spatial domain of EEG is rich in affective information. However, few of the existing studies have simultaneously analyzed EEG signals from multiple perspectives of geometric and anatomical structures in spatial domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-view Graph Transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations, which integrates information from the temporal, frequency and spatial domains, including geometric and anatomical structures, so as to enhance the expressive power of the model comprehensively. We incorporate the spatial information of EEG channels into the model as encoding, thereby improving its ability to perceive the spatial structure of the channels. Meanwhile, experimental results based on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recent years. In addition, the results also show that the MVGT could extract information from multiple domains and capture inter-channel relationships in EEG emotion recognition tasks effectively.</description>

      <title>VCHAR:Variance-Driven Complex Human Activity Recognition framework with Generative Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex human activity recognition (CHAR) remains a pivotal challenge within ubiquitous computing, especially in the context of smart environments. Existing studies typically require meticulous labeling of both atomic and complex activities, a task that is labor-intensive and prone to errors due to the scarcity and inaccuracies of available datasets. Most prior research has focused on datasets that either precisely label atomic activities or, at minimum, their sequence approaches that are often impractical in real world settings.In response, we introduce VCHAR (Variance-Driven Complex Human Activity Recognition), a novel framework that treats the outputs of atomic activities as a distribution over specified intervals. Leveraging generative methodologies, VCHAR elucidates the reasoning behind complex activity classifications through video-based explanations, accessible to users without prior machine learning expertise. Our evaluation across three publicly available datasets demonstrates that VCHAR enhances the accuracy of complex activity recognition without necessitating precise temporal or sequential labeling of atomic activities. Furthermore, user studies confirm that VCHAR's explanations are more intelligible compared to existing methods, facilitating a broader understanding of complex activity recognition among non-experts.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Data Tsunami: A Comprehensive Survey on Data Assessment and Selection for Instruction Tuning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies.
