      <title>Direct space-time modeling of mechanically dressed dipole-dipole interactions with electromagnetically-coupled oscillating dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the radiative dynamics of coupled electric dipoles, modelled as Lorentz oscillators (LOs), in the presence of real-time mechanical oscillations. The dipoles are treated in a self-consistent way through a direct electromagnetic simulation approach that fully includes the dynamical movement of the charges, accounting for radiation reaction, emission and absorption. This allows for a powerful numerical solution of optomechanical resonances without any perturbative approximations for the mechanical motion. The scaled population (excitation) dynamics of the LOs are investigated as well as the emitted radiation and electromagnetic spectra, which demonstrates how the usual dipole-dipole resonances couple to the underlying Floquet states, yielding multiple spectral peaks that are separated from the superradiant and subradiant states by an integer number of the mechanical oscillation frequency. Moreover, we observe that when the mechanical amplitude and frequency are sufficiently large, these additional spectral peaks undergo further modification, including spectral splitting, spectral squeezing, or shifting. These observations are fully corroborated by a theoretical Floquet analysis conducted on two coupled harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Observation of returning Thouless pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduced by David Thouless in 1983, Thouless pumping exemplifies topological properties in topological systems, where the transported charge is quantized by the Chern number. Recently, returning Thouless pumping was theoretically proposed, in which quantized charge is pumped during the first half of the cycle but returns to zero in the second half. This mechanism leads to crystalline symmetry-protected delicate topological insulators. Unlike conventional topological bands, a delicate topological band is Wannierizable but not atomically obstructed, which features multicellular Wannier functions extending beyond a single unit cell. Here, by replacing the second dimension with a synthetic dimension, we realize a two-dimensional delicate topological insulator via a set of one-dimensional acoustic crystals with fine-tuned geometric parameters. Through acoustic bands and wavefunction measurements, we directly observe returning Thouless pumping and symmetric multicellular Wannier functions, followed by establishing the bulk-boundary correspondence between sub-Brillouin zone Chern numbers and gapless boundary modes. As enriched by crystalline symmetries, our experimental demonstration of returning Thouless pumping expands the current understanding of topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Polarization Paradoxes I: the Diamagnetic Polarization Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate calculation of the total polarization charge density in a plasma is essential for a self-consistent determination of the electric field. Yet, for a magnetized plasma, there are two different polarization paradoxes that are finally resolved in this work. The "diamagnetic polarization paradox'' refers to the fact that there is a paradoxical factor of 1/2 difference between the pressure-driven "diamagnetic polarization'' density calculated using the real space drift theory versus the action-angle space guiding center and gyrokinetic theory that has not been explained before. In this work, it is shown that the results of both approaches can be made consistent with one another. Half of the diamagnetic polarization is due to the transformation from the guiding center density to the real space density. The other half is due to the fact that, within the drift kinetic ordering assumptions, the guiding center density should be expressed as the gyroaverage of the density in the limit of vanishing Larmor radius. Expressions for the diamagnetic polarization density are given that are accurate to first order in amplitude and all orders in gyroradius within gyrokinetic theory for a constant magnetic field. Applications to anisotropic Maxwell-Boltzmann particle distribution functions are presented. Because the total energy and toroidal momentum are local invariants, they do not generate net polarization effects: the electric and thermodynamic polarizations must precisely cancel. In contrast, anisotropic dependance on the magnetic moment generates a net polarization proportional to the temperature anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct estimation of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density (BND) from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental BND values.</description>

      <title>From Brain to Motion: Harnessing Higher-Derivative Mechanics for Neural Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal Feedback Control (OFC) provides a theoretical framework for goal-directed movements, where the nervous system adjusts actions based on sensory feedback. In OFC, the central nervous system (CNS) not only reacts to stimuli but proactively predicts and adjusts motor commands, minimizing errors and (often energetic) costs through internal models. OFC theory assumes that there exists a cost function that is optimized throughout one's movement. It is natural to assume that mechanical quantities should be involved in cost functions. This does not imply that the mechanical principles that govern human voluntary movements are necessarily Newtonian. Indeed, the undisputed efficiency of Newtonian mechanics to model and predict the motion of non-living systems does not guarantee its relevance to model human behavior. We propose that integrating principles from Lagrangian and Hamiltonian higher-derivative mechanics, i.e. dynamical models that go beyond Newtonian mechanics, provides a more natural framework to study the constraints hidden in human voluntary movement within OFC theory.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-induced boundary localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bloch wavefunctions in crystals experience localization within the bulk when disorder is introduced, a phenomenon commonly known as Anderson localization. This effect is considered universal, being applicable to all types of waves, quantum or classical. However, the interaction between disorder and topology -- a concept that has profoundly transformed many branches of physics -- necessitates revisiting the original Anderson localization picture. For instance, in the recently discovered topological Anderson insulator, the introduction of disorder induces topological boundary states that can resist localization due to protection from line-gap topology. While line-gap topology applies to both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems uniquely exhibit point-gap topology, which has no Hermitian counterparts and leads to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate disorder-induced point-gap topology in a non-Hermitian acoustic crystal. This crystal, with non-Hermitian disorder in nearest-neighbor couplings, exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect, where all eigenstates localize at a boundary. Interestingly, the boundary where localization occurs -- either the left or right -- depends on the strength of the disorder. As the disorder strength increases, the direction of boundary localization can be reversed. Additionally, we observe a ``bipolar" skin effect, where boundary localization occurs at both the left and right boundaries when disorder is introduced in next-nearest-neighbor couplings. These findings experimentally reveal a non-Hermitian mechanism of disorder-induced localization that goes beyond the conventional framework of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Simple and exact nonlinear pendulum motion for all possible initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum motion are derived for all three classes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires tractable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum. Although with seemingly very different characteristic motions, the swinging and the spinning motion can now be treated on the same footing using frequency domain. The key insights provided by the solutions is the importance of angular velocity frequency analysis, rather than that of angular displacement. The emphasis on velocity frequency domain should benefit other studies of nonlinear motion as well. Brief theoretical derivations are given. The solutions are validated by exact numerical values and frequencies analysis of dynamical simulations using velocity verlet integration.</description>

      <title>Variational Resolution of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac Equation Pathologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a structural variational resolution of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) pathologies. By deriving the Variational Kinematic Constraint (VKC) and the Variational Dynamics Constraint (VDC) from the particle's proper-time perspective, we show that self-induced variations are forbidden and dynamics arise solely from first-order proper-time variations of external fields. Consequently, self-force terms are excluded at the variational level, eliminating runaway solutions and non-causal behavior without regularization. Our framework further provides a first-principles derivation of minimal coupling and reveals gauge invariance as a necessary consequence of proper-time-based variational structure.</description>

      <title>The Duality of Whittaker Potential Theory: Fundamental Representations of Electromagnetism and Gravity, and Their Orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08309v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: E. T. Whittaker produced two papers in 1903 and 1904 that, although sometimes considered mere mathematical statements (Barrett, 1993), held important implications for physical theory. The Whittaker 1903 paper united electrostatic and gravitational attraction as resulting from longitudinal waves - waves whose wavefronts propagate parallel to their direction. The Whittaker 1904 paper showed that electromagnetic waves resulted from the interference of two such longitudinal waves or scalar potential functions. Although unexplored, the implications of these papers are profound: gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the existence of a hyperspace above or behind normal space, the elimination of gravitational and point charge singularities, MOND, and the expansion of the universe. This last implication can be related to the recent finding that black holes with posited vacuum energy interior solutions alongside cosmological boundaries have a cosmological coupling constant of k=3, meaning that black holes gain mass-proportional to a3 in a parameterization equation within a Robertson-Walker cosmology and are a cosmological accelerated expansion species (Farrah et al., 2023). This expansion and many features of General Relativity can be explained by the mass-proportionality and preferred direction of the longitudinal waves within the two underlying non-local Whittaker potentials (Titleman, 2022). Whittaker potential theory also offers a simple explanation for expansion of the universe - it is produced as longitudinal motion within the Whittaker potentials only when dynamic electromagnetism is separate from time-static gravity in intergalactic space.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench: Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</description>
