      <title>Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio interferometric array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality images of the sky.
  Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper, we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the detected RFI.</description>

      <title>HyperAIRI: a plug-and-play algorithm for precise hyperspectral image reconstruction in radio interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure (FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularisation step via learned denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension, underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighbouring channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained with a Jacobian regularisation enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a variant of the optimisation-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity across spectral channels via the l2,1-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its superior performance compared to its optimisation-based counterpart Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.</description>

      <title>BREAKFAST: A Framework for general joint BA duty and follow-up guidance of multiple $\gamma$-ray monitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing number of gamma-ray monitors in operation, several research teams have adopted a strategy of joint operation and scientific duty to improve efficiency. A successful example is the GECAM-HXMT-SVOM (GHS) constellation collaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor constellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to Burst Advocates (BAs), including the increased number of triggers and, more importantly, the frequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among different missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current requirements of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, we developed a customized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty, named "BA's Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and Summary Tools" (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated, semi-automated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of prompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while maintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of BREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST also aims to filtering high-value targets and guiding follow-up telescopes through rapid analysis and reporting, thus serving as an important bridge between prompt emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a suite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly the specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on prompt emission properties. The framework's effectiveness has already been demonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a significant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the future.</description>

      <title>The Missing Multipole Problem: Investigating biases from model starting frequency in gravitational-wave analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our ability to infer the true source properties of colliding black holes from gravitational wave observations requires not only accurate waveform models but also their correct use. A key property when evaluating time-domain models is when to start the waveform: choosing a time that is too late can omit low-frequency power from higher order multipoles. By focusing on binary systems with total mass $\ge 200 \, M_{\odot}$, we show that current detectors are sensitive to this missing power and biased source properties can be obtained. We show that for systems with total mass $\lesssim 300 \, M_{\odot}$, mass ratio $\gtrsim 0.33$, and signal-to-noise ratio $\rho \gtrsim 20$, templates starting at $20 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased source properties. As the total mass increases, and the component masses become more asymmetric, templates starting from $13 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased properties. If the gravitational-wave signal is observed at signal-to-noise ratio $\rho &lt; 20$, time-domain models can start from $20\, \mathrm{Hz}$ as statistical uncertainties dominate.</description>

      <title>Precise frequencies of H$_2^{~16}$O lines protected for radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise frequency values have been determined for H$_2^{~16}$O radio lines appearing in protected line lists of the International Astronomical Union and the Panel on Frequency Allocations of the US National Academy of Sciences. The improved precision is attributable to a spectroscopic network built from a large set of near-infrared Lamb-dip lines augmented with a handful of ultrahigh-accuracy rotational transitions. The ultraprecise H$_2^{~16}$O network contains 376 Lamb-dip lines recorded previously via our frequency-comb locked cavity-enhanced spectrometer. During the present study, altogether 55 target lines have been (re)measured at high accuracy. Due to our network-assisted measurements, the accuracy has been significantly improved with respect to previous direct radio-frequency measurements for all the protected lines of H$_2^{~16}$O above 750 GHz. Furthermore, 43 of these protected transitions now benefit from the accuracy of the new near-infrared Lamb dips reported in this paper.</description>

      <title>Event types in H.E.S.S.: a combined analysis for different telescope types and energy ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are the main technique for detecting gamma rays with energies between tens of GeV and hundreds of TeV. Amongst them, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) has pioneered the use of different telescope types to achieve an energy range as broad as possible. A large, 28 m diameter telescope is used in monoscopic mode to access the lowest energies ($E \gtrsim 30$ GeV), while the four smaller, 12 m diameter telescopes are used in stereoscopic mode to study energies between 150 GeV and 100 TeV. Nevertheless, a combination of both telescope types and trigger strategies has proven to be challenging. In this work, we propose for the first time an analysis based on event types capable of exploiting both telescope types, trigger strategies, and the whole energy range of the experiment. Due to the large differences between monoscopic and stereoscopic reconstructions, the types are defined based on Hillas parameters of individual events, resulting in three types (Type M, Type B, and Type A), each dominating over a different energy range. The performances of the new analysis configurations are compared to the standard configurations in the H.E.S.S. Analysis Package (HAP), Mono and Stereo. The proposed analysis provides optimal sensitivity over the whole energy range, in contrast to Mono and Stereo, which focus on smaller energy ranges. On top of that, improvements in sensitivity of 25-45% are found for most of the energy range. The analysis is validated using real data from the Crab Nebula, showing the application to data of an IACT analysis capable of combining significantly different telescope types with significantly different energy ranges. Larger energy coverage, lower energy threshold, smaller statistical uncertainty, and more robustness are observed. The need for a run-by-run correction for the observation conditions is also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Definition and Realization of the International Lunar Reference Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All future lunar missions require a definition of the lunar reference system and a realization in the form of the lunar reference frame to ensure consistent products for positioning, navigation, cartography, and timing. This paper defines the origin, orientation, and scale of the Lunar Reference System (LRS), as well as provides numerical solutions for the first realization of the International Lunar Reference Frame (ILRF). ILRF is defined as the Principal Axis (PA) system, attached to the surface and co-rotating with the Moon, with its origin in the lunar center of mass (lunocenter). The ILRF realization is based on variance component estimation of the three lunar ephemeris solutions: INPOP21a, DE430, and EPM2021 for the series of the position of the lunar center of mass and rotation Euler angles -- precession, nutation, and proper rotation. The solution is valid starting with the period covered by Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) data in 1970 and ending with extrapolated ILRF realizations in 2052 for future lunar missions. Results. The combined ILRF is characterized by the mean error of 17.6 cm for 2010-2030, where 15.3 cm comes from the origin and 8.6 cm from the orientation realization. The error in the realization of the origin is mainly caused by a poor geometry of the retroreflector network, resulting in a high correlation between the scale and the X component of the lunocenter in PA. The LLR post-fit residuals in ILRF are at the level of 2-3 cm in terms of the standard deviations of one-way ranges for best-performing LLR stations. The mean errors of the transformation between ILRF and other reference frame realizations in PA are at the level of 3 cm, whereas the mean transformation error to the DE421 Mean Earth frame equals 5 cm.</description>

      <title>J-GEM near-infrared follow-up observations of the gravitational wave event S240422ed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report our near-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations of the gravitational wave (GW) event S240422ed using the Subaru Telescope/MOIRCS. S240422ed was initially classified as a black hole-neutron star merger with $&gt;$ 99% probability of electromagnetic wave emission. We started follow-up observations 7.8 hours after the event. Over two nights, we observed 206 nearby galaxies in $Y$ and $K_{\rm s}$ bands down to about 21.4 and 21.1 AB mag (3$\sigma$), respectively. The total completeness of our survey based on galaxy $B$-band luminosity is 22%. As a result of our observations, five candidate counterparts were identified. We show that properties of these five objects are not consistent with kilonova such as AT2017gfo. Four objects are consistent with known classes of transients such as supernovae or dwarf nova outbursts. On the other hand, the nature of the remaining one object, which shows a red color and rapid decline, remains unclear. Although later analyses of GW signal reclassified S240422ed as likely terrestrial noise, our NIR observations provide valuable lessons for future NIR surveys for GW sources. We demonstrate that deep NIR follow-up observations as presented in this work would effectively constrain the presence of red kilonova even at 200 Mpc distance. We also discuss the importance of deep and wide NIR reference images and of understanding the properties and frequency of Galactic transients.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search for Gravitational Wave of Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves. However, the computational costs of searching large template banks limit the efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. This work explores the application of a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on Grover's algorithm to MBHB signals. Under certain simplifying assumptions, quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank. Simulated results illustrate the potential reduction in computational costs, while also showing that the performance can degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm. These findings reveal both the potential and the limitations of quantum search for MBHB signals, pointing to the importance of developing more robust and stable search strategies alongside realistic modeling in future work.</description>
