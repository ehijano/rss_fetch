      <title>Multi-Community Spectral Clustering for Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the soft geometric block model (SGBM) with a fixed number $k \geq 2$ of homogeneous communities in the dense regime, and we introduce a spectral clustering algorithm for community recovery on graphs generated by this model. Given such a graph, the algorithm produces an embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{k-1}$ using the eigenvectors associated with the $k-1$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph that are closest to a value determined by the parameters of the model. It then applies $k$-means clustering to the embedding. We prove weak consistency and show that a simple local refinement step ensures strong consistency. A key ingredient is an application of a non-standard version of Davis-Kahan theorem to control eigenspace perturbations when eigenvalues are not simple. We also analyze the limiting spectrum of the adjacency matrix, using a combination of combinatorial and matrix techniques.</description>

      <title>WOCD: A Semi-Supervised Method for Overlapping Community Detection Using Weak Cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overlapping community detection (OCD) is a fundamental graph data analysis task for extracting graph patterns. Traditional OCD methods can be broadly divided into node clustering and link clustering approaches, both of which rely solely on link information to identify overlapping communities. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have made significant advancements for this task. However, existing GNN-based approaches often face difficulties in effectively integrating link, attribute, and prior information, along with challenges like limited receptive fields and over-smoothing, which hinder their performance on complex overlapping community detection. In this paper, we propose a Weak-clique based Overlapping Community Detection method, namely WOCD, which incorporates prior information and optimizes the use of link information to improve detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce pseudo-labels within a semi-supervised framework to strengthen the generalization ability, making WOCD more versatile. Furthermore, we initialize pseudo-labels using weak cliques to fully leverage link and prior information, leading to better detection accuracy. Additionally, we employ a single-layer Graph Transformer combined with GNN, which achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining efficiency. We evaluate WOCD on eight real-world attributed datasets, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised OCD method by a significant margin in terms of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Star Network Motifs on X during COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social network motifs are recurring patterns of small subgraphs that indicate fundamental patterns of social communication. In this work, we study the simple star network motifs that recur on X during the COVID-19 discourse. We study the profile of the manifestation of the star network among bot and human users. There are six primary patterns of the star motif, differentiating by the bots and humans being either egos and alters. We describe the presentation of each of these six patterns in our data, demonstrating how the motif patterns can inform social media behavioral analysis.</description>

      <title>Are LLM-Powered Social Media Bots Realistic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more sophisticated, there is a possibility to harness LLMs to power social media bots. This work investigates the realism of generating LLM-Powered social media bot networks. Through a combination of manual effort, network science and LLMs, we create synthetic bot agent personas, their tweets and their interactions, thereby simulating social media networks. We compare the generated networks against empirical bot/human data, observing that both network and linguistic properties of LLM-Powered Bots differ from Wild Bots/Humans. This has implications towards the detection and effectiveness of LLM-Powered Bots.</description>

      <title>Network Prebunking Problem: Optimizing Prebunking Targets to Suppress the Spread of Misinformation in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a countermeasure against misinformation that undermines the healthy use of social media, a preventive intervention known as prebunking has recently attracted attention in the field of psychology. Prebunking aims to strengthen individuals' cognitive resistance to misinformation by presenting weakened doses of misinformation or by teaching common manipulation techniques before they encounter actual misinformation. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at the individual level, an important open question remains: how best to identify the optimal targets for prebunking interventions to mitigate the spread of misinformation in a social network. To address this issue, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem, called the network prebunking problem, to identify optimal prebunking targets for minimizing the spread of misinformation in a social network. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and propose an approximation algorithm, MIA-NPP, based on the Maximum Influence Arborescence (MIA) approach, which restricts influence propagation around each node to a local directed tree rooted at that node. Through numerical experiments using real-world social network datasets, we demonstrate that MIA-NPP effectively suppresses the spread of misinformation under both fully observed and uncertain model parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Shooting the Messenger? Harassment and Hate Speech Directed at Journalists on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Journalists have incorporated social networks into their work as a standard tool, enhancing their ability to produce and disseminate information and making it easier for them to connect more directly with their audiences. However, this greater presence in the digital public sphere has also increased their exposure to harassment and hate speech, particularly in the case of women journalists. This study analyzes the presence of harassment and hate speech in responses (n = 60,684) to messages that 200 journalists and media outlets posted on X (formerly Twitter) accounts during the days immediately preceding and following the July 23 (23-J) general elections held in Spain in 2023. The results indicate that the most common forms of harassment were insults and political hate, which were more frequently aimed at personal accounts than institutional ones, highlighting the significant role of political polarization-particularly during election periods-in shaping the hostility that journalists face. Moreover, although, generally speaking, the total number of harassing messages was similar for men and women, it was found that a greater number of sexist messages were aimed at women journalists, and an ideological dimension was identified in the hate speech that extremists or right-wing populists directed at them. This study corroborates that this is a minor but systemic issue, particularly from a political and gender perspective. To counteract this, the media must develop proactive policies and protective actions extending even to the individual level, where this issue usually applies.</description>

      <title>Effective and Efficient Conductance-based Community Search at Billion Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community search is a widely studied semi-supervised graph clustering problem, retrieving a high-quality connected subgraph containing the user-specified query vertex. However, existing methods primarily focus on cohesiveness within the community but ignore the sparsity outside the community, obtaining sub-par results. Inspired by this, we adopt the well-known conductance metric to measure the quality of a community and introduce a novel problem of conductance-based community search (CCS). CCS aims at finding a subgraph with the smallest conductance among all connected subgraphs that contain the query vertex. We prove that the CCS problem is NP-hard. To efficiently query CCS, a four-stage subgraph-conductance-based community search algorithm, SCCS, is proposed. Specifically, we first greatly reduce the entire graph using local sampling techniques. Then, a three-stage local optimization strategy is employed to continuously refine the community quality. Namely, we first utilize a seeding strategy to obtain an initial community to enhance its internal cohesiveness. Then, we iteratively add qualified vertices in the expansion stage to guarantee the internal cohesiveness and external sparsity of the community. Finally, we gradually remove unqualified vertices during the verification stage. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets containing one billion-scale graph and synthetic datasets show the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our solutions.</description>

      <title>A graph neural network based on feature network for identifying influential nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is of great importance, and has many applications in practice. For example, finding influential nodes in e-commerce network can provide merchants with customers with strong purchase intent; identifying influential nodes in computer information system can help locating the components that cause the system break down and identifying influential nodes in these networks can accelerate the flow of information in networks. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made on the problem of indentifying influential nodes. However, previous efforts either consider only one aspect of the network structure, or using global centralities with high time consuming as node features to identify influential nodes, and the existing methods do not consider the relationships between different centralities. To solve these problems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature Network, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as GCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency, FNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among the local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are determined. By taking a shallow GCN and a deep GCN into the FNGCN framework, two FNGCNs are developed. With ground truth obtained from the widely used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model, the two FNGCNs are compared with the state-of-art methods on several real-world networks. Experimental results show that the two FNGCNs can identify the influential nodes more accurately than the compared methods, indicating that the proposed framework is effective in identifying influential nodes in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Long-term resilience of online battle over vaccines and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What has been the impact of the enormous amounts of time, effort and money spent promoting pro-vaccine science from pre-COVID-19 to now? We answer this using a unique mapping of online competition between pro- and anti-vaccination views among ~100M Facebook Page members, tracking 1,356 interconnected communities through platform interventions. Remarkably, the network's fundamental architecture shows no change: the isolation of established expertise and the symbiosis of anti and mainstream neutral communities persist. This means that even if the same time, effort and money continue to be spent, nothing will likely change. The reason for this resilience lies in "glocal" evolution: Communities blend multiple topics while bridging neighborhood-level to international scales, creating redundant pathways that transcend categorical targeting. The solution going forward is to focus on the system's network. We show how network engineering approaches can achieve opinion moderation without content removal, representing a paradigm shift from suppression towards structural interventions.</description>

      <title>A Parallel Algorithm for Finding Robust Spanners in Large Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks, characterized by community structures, often rely on nodes called structural hole spanners to facilitate inter-community information dissemination. However, the dynamic nature of these networks, where spanner nodes may be removed, necessitates resilient methods to maintain inter-community communication. To this end, we introduce robust spanners (RS) as nodes uniquely equipped to bridge communities despite disruptions, such as node or edge removals. We propose a novel scoring technique to identify RS nodes and present a parallel algorithm with a CUDA implementation for efficient RS detection in large networks. Empirical analysis of real-world social networks reveals that high-scoring nodes exhibit a spanning capacity comparable to those identified by benchmark spanner detection algorithms while offering superior robustness. Our implementation on Nvidia GPUs achieves an average speedup of 244X over traditional spanner detection techniques, demonstrating its efficacy to identify RS in large social networks.</description>

      <title>Social Media Information Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The battlefield of information warfare has moved to online social networks, where influence campaigns operate at unprecedented speed and scale. As with any strategic domain, success requires understanding the terrain, modeling adversaries, and executing interventions. This tutorial introduces a formal optimization framework for social media information operations (IO), where the objective is to shape opinions through targeted actions. This framework is parameterized by quantities such as network structure, user opinions, and activity levels - all of which must be estimated or inferred from data. We discuss analytic tools that support this process, including centrality measures for identifying influential users, clustering algorithms for detecting community structure, and sentiment analysis for gauging public opinion. These tools either feed directly into the optimization pipeline or help defense analysts interpret the information environment. With the landscape mapped, we highlight threats such as coordinated bot networks, extremist recruitment, and viral misinformation. Countermeasures range from content-level interventions to mathematically optimized influence strategies. Finally, the emergence of generative AI transforms both offense and defense, democratizing persuasive capabilities while enabling scalable defenses. This shift calls for algorithmic innovation, policy reform, and ethical vigilance to protect the integrity of our digital public sphere.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Social Media Sentiment for Predictive Algorithmic Trading Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how social media sentiment derived from Reddit comments can be used to enhance investment decisions in a way that offers higher returns with lower risk. Using BERTweet we analyzed over 2 million Reddit comments from the subreddit r/wallstreetbets and developed a Sentiment Volume Change (SVC) metric combining sentiment and comment volume changes, which showed significantly improved correlation with next-day returns compared to sentiment alone. We then implemented two different investment strategies that relied solely on SVC to make decisions. Back testing these strategies over four years (2020-2023) our strategies significantly outperformed a comparable buy-and-hold (B&amp;H) strategy in a bull market, achieving 70% higher returns in 2023 and 84.4% higher returns in 2021 while also mitigating losses by 4% in a declining market in 2022. Our results confirm that comment sentiment and volume data derived from Reddit can be effective in predicting short-term stock price movements and sentiment-powered strategies can offer superior risk-adjusted returns as compared to the market, implying that social media sentiment can potentially be a valuable investment tool.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Trust Embeddings from Siamese Trust Scores: A Direct-Sum Approach with Fixed-Point Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x 10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.</description>

      <title>Graph Unlearning via Embedding Reconstruction -- A Range-Null Space Decomposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph unlearning is tailored for GNNs to handle widespread and various graph structure unlearning requests, which remain largely unexplored. The GIF (graph influence function) achieves validity under partial edge unlearning, but faces challenges in dealing with more disturbing node unlearning. To avoid the overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment. To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes, with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.</description>

      <title>Confrontation of capitalism and socialism in Wikipedia networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Ising Network Opinion Formation (INOF) model and apply it for the analysis of networks of 6 Wikipedia language editions. In the model, Ising spins are placed at network nodes/articles and the steady-state opinion polarization of spins is determined from the Monte Carlo iterations in which a given spin orientation is determined by in-going links from other spins. The main consideration is done for opinion confrontation between {\it capitalism, imperialism} (blue opinion) and {\it socialism, communism} (red opinion). These nodes have fixed spin/opinion orientation while other nodes achieve their steady-state opinions in the process of Monte Carlo iterations. We find that the global network opinion favors {\it socialism, communism} for all 6 editions. The model also determines the opinion preferences for world countries and political leaders, showing good agreement with heuristic expectations. We also present results for opinion competition between {\it Christianity} and {\it Islam}, and USA Democratic and Republican parties. We argue that the INOF approach can find numerous applications for directed complex networks.</description>

      <title>More than Memes: A Multimodal Topic Modeling Approach to Conspiracy Theories on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. However, existing research often neglects visual content beyond memes, and in addition lacks methods to compare topic models across modalities. Our study addresses these gaps by applying multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels. We use BERTopic with CLIP for the analysis of textual and visual data in a corpus of ~40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories. Through this dataset, we provide insights into unimodal and multimodal topic models by analyzing symmetry and intersections of topics across modalities. We demonstrate the variety of textual and visual content shared in the channels discovered through the topic modeling, and propose a conceptual framework for the analysis of textual and visual discursive strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories. We apply the framework in a case study of the topic group Israel Gaza.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Misinformation Detection Data and Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05060v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misinformation is a complex societal issue, and mitigating solutions are difficult to create due to data deficiencies. To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection. All datasets and other artifacts are available at https://misinfo-datasets.complexdatalab.com/.</description>

      <title>A High-Performance Evolutionary Multiobjective Community Detection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection in complex networks is fundamental across social, biological, and technological domains. While traditional single-objective methods like Louvain and Leiden are computationally efficient, they suffer from resolution bias and structural degeneracy. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) address these limitations by simultaneously optimizing conflicting structural criteria, however, their high computational costs have historically limited their application to small networks. We present HP-MOCD, a High-Performance Evolutionary Multiobjective Community Detection Algorithm built on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), which overcomes these barriers through topology-aware genetic operators, full parallelization, and bit-level optimizations, achieving theoretical O(GN_p|V|) complexity. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks. Results demonstrate strong scalability, with HP-MOCD processing networks of over 1,000,000 nodes while maintaining high quality across varying noise levels. It outperforms other MOEAs by more than 531 times in runtime on synthetic datasets, achieving runtimes as low as 57 seconds for graphs with 40,000 nodes on moderately powered hardware. Across 14 real-world networks, HP-MOCD was the only MOEA capable of processing the six largest datasets within a reasonable time, with results competitive with single-objective approaches. Unlike single-solution methods, HP-MOCD produces a Pareto Front, enabling individual-specific trade-offs and providing decision-makers with a spectrum of high-quality community structures. It introduces the first open-source Python MOEA library compatible with networkx and igraph for large-scale community detection.</description>

      <title>Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinarity Revealed by Transitive Reduction of Citation Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.06015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of transitive reduction on citation networks. Our hypothesis is that documents which lose fewer citations under transitive reduction are likely to be interdisciplinary, while a large loss of citations suggests a document is primarily cited within a single discipline. We test this hypothesis by using an artificial model of a citation network and by using data on citations from three sources: academic papers, court decisions and patents. Where needed, we applied modularity-based clustering techniques on a network defined using bibliographic coupling to classify documents by topic. A cluster-dependent measure was then used to classify the nodes as interdisciplinary or intradisciplinary. Our results provide strong support for our hypothesis in three of the four cases, with somewhat weaker but still positive support in the case of patents.</description>

      <title>Network Embedding with Completely-imbalanced Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.03545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network embedding, aiming to project a network into a low-dimensional space, is increasingly becoming a focus of network research. Semi-supervised network embedding takes advantage of labeled data, and has shown promising performance. However, existing semi-supervised methods would get unappealing results in the completely-imbalanced label setting where some classes have no labeled nodes at all. To alleviate this, we propose two novel semi-supervised network embedding methods. The first one is a shallow method named RSDNE. Specifically, to benefit from the completely-imbalanced labels, RSDNE guarantees both intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity in an approximate way. The other method is RECT which is a new class of graph neural networks. Different from RSDNE, to benefit from the completely-imbalanced labels, RECT explores the class-semantic knowledge. This enables RECT to handle networks with node features and multi-label setting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods. Code is available at https://github.com/zhengwang100/RECT.</description>

      <title>Node Duplication Improves Cold-start Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are prominent in graph machine learning and have shown state-of-the-art performance in Link Prediction (LP) tasks. Nonetheless, recent studies show that GNNs struggle to produce good results on low-degree nodes despite their overall strong performance. In practical applications of LP, like recommendation systems, improving performance on low-degree nodes is critical, as it amounts to tackling the cold-start problem of improving the experiences of users with few observed interactions. In this paper, we investigate improving GNNs' LP performance on low-degree nodes while preserving their performance on high-degree nodes and propose a simple yet surprisingly effective augmentation technique called NodeDup. Specifically, NodeDup duplicates low-degree nodes and creates links between nodes and their own duplicates before following the standard supervised LP training scheme. By leveraging a ''multi-view'' perspective for low-degree nodes, NodeDup shows significant LP performance improvements on low-degree nodes without compromising any performance on high-degree nodes. Additionally, as a plug-and-play augmentation module, NodeDup can be easily applied to existing GNNs with very light computational cost. Extensive experiments show that NodeDup achieves 38.49%, 13.34%, and 6.76% improvements on isolated, low-degree, and warm nodes, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to GNNs and state-of-the-art cold-start methods.</description>

      <title>Robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection in the face of network perturbations, specifically edge deletions. Graph embedding techniques, which represent nodes as low-dimensional vectors, are widely used for various graph machine learning tasks due to their ability to capture structural properties of networks effectively. However, the impact of perturbations on the performance of these methods remains relatively understudied. The research considers state-of-the-art graph embedding methods from two families: matrix factorization (e.g., LE, LLE, HOPE, M-NMF) and random walk-based (e.g., DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec). Through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks, the study reveals varying degrees of robustness within each family of graph embedding methods. The robustness is found to be influenced by factors such as network size, initial community partition strength, and the type of perturbation. Notably, node2vec and LLE consistently demonstrate higher robustness for community detection across different scenarios, including networks with degree and community size heterogeneity. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate graph embedding method based on the specific characteristics of the network and the task at hand, particularly in scenarios where robustness to perturbations is crucial.</description>

      <title>Between Linear and Sinusoidal: Rethinking the Time Encoder in Dynamic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic graph learning is essential for applications involving temporal networks and requires effective modeling of temporal relationships. Seminal attention-based models like TGAT and DyGFormer rely on sinusoidal time encoders to capture temporal dependencies between edge events. Prior work justified sinusoidal encodings because their inner products depend on the time spans between events, which are crucial features for modeling inter-event relations. However, sinusoidal encodings inherently lose temporal information due to their many-to-one nature and therefore require high dimensions. In this paper, we rigorously study a simpler alternative: the linear time encoder, which avoids temporal information loss caused by sinusoidal functions and reduces the need for high-dimensional time encoders. We show that the self-attention mechanism can effectively learn to compute time spans between events from linear time encodings and extract relevant temporal patterns. Through extensive experiments on six dynamic graph datasets, we demonstrate that the linear time encoder improves the performance of TGAT and DyGFormer in most cases. Moreover, the linear time encoder can lead to significant savings in model parameters with minimal performance loss. For example, compared to a 100-dimensional sinusoidal time encoder, TGAT with a 2-dimensional linear time encoder saves 43% of parameters and achieves higher average precision on five datasets. While both encoders can be used simultaneously, our study highlights the often-overlooked advantages of linear time features in modern dynamic graph models. These findings can positively impact the design choices of various dynamic graph learning architectures and eventually benefit temporal network applications such as recommender systems, communication networks, and traffic forecasting.</description>

      <title>Can Memory-Augmented LLM Agents Aid Journalism in Interpreting and Framing News for Diverse Audiences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern news is often comprehensive, weaving together information from diverse domains, including technology, finance, and agriculture. This very comprehensiveness creates a challenge for interpretation, as audiences typically possess specialized knowledge related to their expertise, age, or standpoint. Consequently, a reader might fully understand the financial implications of a story but fail to grasp or even actively misunderstand its legal or technological dimensions, resulting in critical comprehension gaps. In this work, we investigate how to identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences' understanding of news content, particularly in the aspects of articles outside their primary domains of knowledge. We propose MADES, an agent-based framework designed to simulate societal communication. The framework utilizes diverse agents, each configured to represent a specific occupation or age group. Each agent is equipped with a memory system. These agents are then simulated to discuss the news. This process enables us to monitor and analyze their behavior and cognitive processes. Our findings indicate that the framework can identify confusions and misunderstandings within news content through its iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate identifications, the framework then designs supplementary material. We validated these outcomes using both statistical analysis and human evaluation, and the results show that agents exhibit significantly improved news understanding after receiving this supplementary material.</description>
