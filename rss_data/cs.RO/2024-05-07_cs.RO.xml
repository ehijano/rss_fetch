      <title>UniGen: Unified Modeling of Initial Agent States and Trajectories for Generating Autonomous Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces UniGen, a novel approach to generating new traffic scenarios for evaluating and improving autonomous driving software through simulation. Our approach models all driving scenario elements in a unified model: the position of new agents, their initial state, and their future motion trajectories. By predicting the distributions of all these variables from a shared global scenario embedding, we ensure that the final generated scenario is fully conditioned on all available context in the existing scene. Our unified modeling approach, combined with autoregressive agent injection, conditions the placement and motion trajectory of every new agent on all existing agents and their trajectories, leading to realistic scenarios with low collision rates. Our experimental results show that UniGen outperforms prior state of the art on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</description>

      <title>Direct learning of home vector direction for insect-inspired robot navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insects have long been recognized for their ability to navigate and return home using visual cues from their nest's environment. However, the precise mechanism underlying this remarkable homing skill remains a subject of ongoing investigation. Drawing inspiration from the learning flights of honey bees and wasps, we propose a robot navigation method that directly learns the home vector direction from visual percepts during a learning flight in the vicinity of the nest. After learning, the robot will travel away from the nest, come back by means of odometry, and eliminate the resultant drift by inferring the home vector orientation from the currently experienced view. Using a compact convolutional neural network, we demonstrate successful learning in both simulated and real forest environments, as well as successful homing control of a simulated quadrotor. The average errors of the inferred home vectors in general stay well below the 90{\deg} required for successful homing, and below 24{\deg} if all images contain sufficient texture and illumination. Moreover, we show that the trajectory followed during the initial learning flight has a pronounced impact on the network's performance. A higher density of sample points in proximity to the nest results in a more consistent return. Code and data are available at https://mavlab.tudelft.nl/learning_to_home .</description>

      <title>Learning Planning Abstractions from Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for learning state and action abstractions in sequential decision-making domains. Our framework, planning abstraction from language (PARL), utilizes language-annotated demonstrations to automatically discover a symbolic and abstract action space and induce a latent state abstraction based on it. PARL consists of three stages: 1) recovering object-level and action concepts, 2) learning state abstractions, abstract action feasibility, and transition models, and 3) applying low-level policies for abstract actions. During inference, given the task description, PARL first makes abstract action plans using the latent transition and feasibility functions, then refines the high-level plan using low-level policies. PARL generalizes across scenarios involving novel object instances and environments, unseen concept compositions, and tasks that require longer planning horizons than settings it is trained on.</description>

      <title>Information-driven Affordance Discovery for Efficient Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic affordances, providing information about what actions can be taken in a given situation, can aid robotic manipulation. However, learning about affordances requires expensive large annotated datasets of interactions or demonstrations. In this work, we argue that well-directed interactions with the environment can mitigate this problem and propose an information-based measure to augment the agent's objective and accelerate the affordance discovery process. We provide a theoretical justification of our approach and we empirically validate the approach both in simulation and real-world tasks. Our method, which we dub IDA, enables the efficient discovery of visual affordances for several action primitives, such as grasping, stacking objects, or opening drawers, strongly improving data efficiency in simulation, and it allows us to learn grasping affordances in a small number of interactions, on a real-world setup with a UFACTORY XArm 6 robot arm.</description>

      <title>SVan: A Mobile Hub as a Field Robotics Development and Deployment Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As robotics becomes increasingly vital for environmental protection, there is a growing need for effective deployment methods that match the pace of robotics innovation. Current strategies often fall short, leaving a gap between the potential of robotics and their practical application in the field. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a mobile hub concept designed to provide the necessary infrastructure and support for deploying a diverse, multi-domain robot team effectively. This paper presents the development and insights into `SVAN' (Synchronous Team-Robot Van), a prototype of our mobile hub concept. We delve into the mechanical construction and software setup of SVAN, offering a comprehensive overview of its capabilities and design considerations. Further, we discuss the hardware specifications and share valuable lessons learned during the prototype's development and deployment. In addition to this paper, an accepted video complements our exploration by depicting SVAN in its envisioned role as an environmental guardian, highlighting its potential in ecological monitoring and preservation. Furthermore, our discussion is enriched by referencing a previously accepted paper detailing a novel methodology for continuous UAV mission cycling enabled by a mobile hub like SVAN. These accompanying works underscore our contribution towards addressing the existing gaps in robot deployment strategies, presenting a scalable and efficient framework to overcome operational challenges in environmental robotics.</description>

      <title>Speak the Same Language: Global LiDAR Registration on BIM Using Pose Hough Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction and robotic sensing data originate from disparate sources and are associated with distinct frames of reference. The primary objective of this study is to align LiDAR point clouds with building information modeling (BIM) using a global point cloud registration approach, aimed at establishing a shared understanding between the two modalities, i.e., ``speak the same language''. To achieve this, we design a cross-modality registration method, spanning from front end the back end. At the front end, we extract descriptors by identifying walls and capturing the intersected corners. Subsequently, for the back-end pose estimation, we employ the Hough transform for pose estimation and estimate multiple pose candidates. The final pose is verified by wall-pixel correlation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted real-world multi-session experiments in a large-scale university building, involving two different types of LiDAR sensors. We also report our findings and plan to make our collected dataset open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Distributed Invariant Kalman Filter for Cooperative Localization using Matrix Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of Cooperative Localization (CL) for multi-robot systems, where a group of mobile robots jointly localize themselves by using measurements from onboard sensors and shared information from other robots. We propose a novel distributed invariant Kalman Filter (DInEKF) based on the Lie group theory, to solve the CL problem in a 3-D environment. Unlike the standard EKF which computes the Jacobians based on the linearization at the state estimate, DInEKF defines the robots' motion model on matrix Lie groups and offers the advantage of state estimate-independent Jacobians. This significantly improves the consistency of the estimator. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is fully distributed, relying solely on each robot's ego-motion measurements and information received from its one-hop communication neighbors. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated in both Monte-Carlo simulations and real-world experiments. The results show that the proposed DInEKF outperforms the standard distributed EKF in terms of both accuracy and consistency.</description>

      <title>Uncovering implementable dormant pruning decisions from three different stakeholder perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dormant pruning, or the removal of unproductive portions of a tree while a tree is not actively growing, is an important orchard task to help maintain yield, requiring years to build expertise. Because of long training periods and an increasing labor shortage in agricultural jobs, pruning could benefit from robotic automation. However, to program robots to prune branches, we first need to understand how pruning decisions are made, and what variables in the environment (e.g., branch size and thickness) we need to capture. Working directly with three pruning stakeholders -- horticulturists, growers, and pruners -- we find that each group of human experts approaches pruning decision-making differently. To capture this knowledge, we present three studies and two extracted pruning protocols from field work conducted in Prosser, Washington in January 2022 and 2023. We interviewed six stakeholders (two in each group) and observed pruning across three cultivars -- Bing Cherries, Envy Apples, and Jazz Apples -- and two tree architectures -- Upright Fruiting Offshoot and V-Trellis. Leveraging participant interviews and video data, this analysis uses grounded coding to extract pruning terminology, discover horticultural contexts that influence pruning decisions, and find implementable pruning heuristics for autonomous systems. The results include a validated terminology set, which we offer for use by both pruning stakeholders and roboticists, to communicate general pruning concepts and heuristics. The results also highlight seven pruning heuristics utilizing this terminology set that would be relevant for use by future autonomous robot pruning systems, and characterize three discovered horticultural contexts (i.e., environmental management, crop-load management, and replacement wood) across all three cultivars.</description>

      <title>IMU-Aided Event-based Stereo Visual Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct methods for event-based visual odometry solve the mapping and camera pose tracking sub-problems by establishing implicit data association in a way that the generative model of events is exploited. The main bottlenecks faced by state-of-the-art work in this field include the high computational complexity of mapping and the limited accuracy of tracking. In this paper, we improve our previous direct pipeline \textit{Event-based Stereo Visual Odometry} in terms of accuracy and efficiency. To speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy of edge-pixel sampling according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance in terms of completeness and local smoothness is also improved by combining the temporal stereo results and the static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy issue of camera pose tracking in recovering the yaw component of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce as a prior the gyroscope measurements via pre-integration. Experiments on publicly available datasets justify our improvement. We release our pipeline as an open-source software for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Leveraging swarm capabilities to assist other systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most studies in swarm robotics treat the swarm as an isolated system of interest. We argue that the prevailing view of swarms as self-sufficient, independent systems limits the scope of potential applications for swarm robotics. A robot swarm could act as a support in an heterogeneous system comprising other robots and/or human operators, in particular by quickly providing access to a large amount of data acquired in large unknown environments. Tasks such as target identification &amp; tracking, scouting, or monitoring/surveillance could benefit from this approach.</description>

      <title>Logic-Skill Programming: An Optimization-based Approach to Sequential Skill Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in robot skill learning have unlocked the potential to construct task-agnostic skill libraries, facilitating the seamless sequencing of multiple simple manipulation primitives (aka. skills) to tackle significantly more complex tasks. Nevertheless, determining the optimal sequence for independently learned skills remains an open problem, particularly when the objective is given solely in terms of the final geometric configuration rather than a symbolic goal. To address this challenge, we propose Logic-Skill Programming (LSP), an optimization-based approach that sequences independently learned skills to solve long-horizon tasks. We formulate a first-order extension of a mathematical program to optimize the overall cumulative reward of all skills within a plan, abstracted by the sum of value functions. To solve such programs, we leverage the use of Tensor Train to construct the value function space, and rely on alternations between symbolic search and skill value optimization to find the appropriate skill skeleton and optimal subgoal sequence. Experimental results indicate that the obtained value functions provide a superior approximation of cumulative rewards compared to state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning methods. Furthermore, we validate LSP in three manipulation domains, encompassing both prehensile and non-prehensile primitives. The results demonstrate its capability to identify the optimal solution over the full logic and geometric path. The real-robot experiments showcase the effectiveness of our approach to cope with contact uncertainty and external disturbances in the real world.</description>

      <title>pFedLVM: A Large Vision Model (LVM)-Driven and Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning Framework in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based Autonomous Driving (AD) models often exhibit poor generalization due to data heterogeneity in an ever domain-shifting environment. While Federated Learning (FL) could improve the generalization of an AD model (known as FedAD system), conventional models often struggle with under-fitting as the amount of accumulated training data progressively increases. To address this issue, instead of conventional small models, employing Large Vision Models (LVMs) in FedAD is a viable option for better learning of representations from a vast volume of data. However, implementing LVMs in FedAD introduces three challenges: (I) the extremely high communication overheads associated with transmitting LVMs between participating vehicles and a central server; (II) lack of computing resource to deploy LVMs on each vehicle; (III) the performance drop due to LVM focusing on shared features but overlooking local vehicle characteristics. To overcome these challenges, we propose pFedLVM, a LVM-Driven, Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning framework. In this approach, the LVM is deployed only on central server, which effectively alleviates the computational burden on individual vehicles. Furthermore, the exchange between central server and vehicles are the learned features rather than the LVM parameters, which significantly reduces communication overhead. In addition, we utilize both shared features from all participating vehicles and individual characteristics from each vehicle to establish a personalized learning mechanism. This enables each vehicle's model to learn features from others while preserving its personalized characteristics, thereby outperforming globally shared models trained in general FL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that pFedLVM outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Manifolds: Representing the Landscape of Grasp Affordances in the Relative Pose Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to investigate grasp affordances has received extensive attention over the past several decades. The existing literature provides a robust basis to build upon, though a number of aspects may be improved. Results commonly work in terms of grasp configuration, with little consideration for the manner in which the grasp may be (re-)produced from a reachability and trajectory planning perspective. In addition, the majority of existing learning approaches focus of producing a single viable grasp, offering little transparency on how the result was reached, or insights on its robustness. We propose a different perspective on grasp affordance learning, explicitly accounting for grasp synthesis; that is, the manner in which manipulator kinematics are used to allow materialization of grasps. The approach allows to explicitly map the grasp policy space in terms of generated grasp types and associated grasp quality. Results of numerical simulations illustrate merit of the method and highlight the manner in which it may promote a greater degree of explainability for otherwise intransparent reinforcement processes.</description>

      <title>LTLDoG: Satisfying Temporally-Extended Symbolic Constraints for Safe Diffusion-based Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating effectively in complex environments while complying with specified constraints is crucial for the safe and successful deployment of robots that interact with and operate around people. In this work, we focus on generating long-horizon trajectories that adhere to novel static and temporally-extended constraints/instructions at test time. We propose a data-driven diffusion-based framework, LTLDoG, that modifies the inference steps of the reverse process given an instruction specified using finite linear temporal logic ($\text{LTL}_f$). LTLDoG leverages a satisfaction value function on $\text{LTL}_f$ and guides the sampling steps using its gradient field. This value function can also be trained to generalize to new instructions not observed during training, enabling flexible test-time adaptability. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation illustrate that the method is able to generate trajectories that satisfy formulae that specify obstacle avoidance and visitation sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the analysis of human movement, but the scarcity of specific samples presents a significant challenge in training intelligent systems, particularly in the context of diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing robot-collected data to train classification systems traditionally trained with human-collected data. As a proof of concept, we recorded a database of numeric characters using an ABB robotic arm and an Apple Watch. We compare the classification performance of the trained systems using both human-recorded and robot-recorded data. Our primary objective is to determine the potential for accurate identification of human numeric characters wearing a smartwatch using robotic movement as training data. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the feasibility of using robot-collected data for training classification systems. This research holds broad implications across various domains that require reliable identification, particularly in scenarios where access to human-specific data is limited.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Simultaneous Localization and Multi-Lane Tracking Using Onboard Sensors and a SD Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-definition map with accurate lane-level information is crucial for autonomous driving, but the creation of these maps is a resource-intensive process. To this end, we present a cost-effective solution to create lane-level roadmaps using only the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and a camera on customer vehicles. Our proposed solution utilizes a prior standard-definition (SD) map, GNSS measurements, visual odometry, and lane marking edge detection points, to simultaneously estimate the vehicle's 6D pose, its position within a SD map, and also the 3D geometry of traffic lines. This is achieved using a Bayesian simultaneous localization and multi-object tracking filter, where the estimation of traffic lines is formulated as a multiple extended object tracking problem, solved using a trajectory Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (TPMBM) filter. In TPMBM filtering, traffic lines are modeled using B-spline trajectories, and each trajectory is parameterized by a sequence of control points. The proposed solution has been evaluated using experimental data collected by a test vehicle driving on highway.

      <title>Improving Offline Reinforcement Learning with Inaccurate Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising approach to avoid costly online interaction with the real environment. However, the performance of offline RL highly depends on the quality of the datasets, which may cause extrapolation error in the learning process. In many robotic applications, an inaccurate simulator is often available. However, the data directly collected from the inaccurate simulator cannot be directly used in offline RL due to the well-known exploration-exploitation dilemma and the dynamic gap between inaccurate simulation and the real environment. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach to combine the offline dataset and the inaccurate simulation data in a better manner. Specifically, we pre-train a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to fit the state distribution of the offline dataset. Given this, we collect data from the inaccurate simulator starting from the distribution provided by the generator and reweight the simulated data using the discriminator. Our experimental results in the D4RL benchmark and a real-world manipulation task confirm that our method can benefit more from both inaccurate simulator and limited offline datasets to achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Personalizable Controller for the Walking Assistive omNi-Directional Exo-Robot (WANDER)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving and encouraging mobility in the elderly and adults with chronic conditions is of paramount importance. However, existing walking aids are either inadequate to provide sufficient support to users' stability or too bulky and poorly maneuverable to be used outside hospital environments. In addition, they all lack adaptability to individual requirements. To address these challenges, this paper introduces WANDER, a novel Walking Assistive omNi-Directional Exo-Robot. It consists of an omnidirectional platform and a robust aluminum structure mounted on top of it, which provides partial body weight support. A comfortable and minimally restrictive coupling interface embedded with a force/torque sensor allows to detect users' intentions, which are translated into command velocities by means of a variable admittance controller. An optimization technique based on users' preferences, i.e., Preference-Based Optimization (PBO) guides the choice of the admittance parameters (i.e., virtual mass and damping) to better fit subject-specific needs and characteristics. Experiments with twelve healthy subjects exhibited a significant decrease in energy consumption and jerk when using WANDER with PBO parameters as well as improved user performance and comfort. The great interpersonal variability in the optimized parameters highlights the importance of personalized control settings when walking with an assistive device, aiming to enhance users' comfort and mobility while ensuring reliable physical support.</description>

      <title>$\textbf{Splat-MOVER}$: Multi-Stage, Open-Vocabulary Robotic Manipulation via Editable Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Splat-MOVER, a modular robotics stack for open-vocabulary robotic manipulation, which leverages the editability of Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) scene representations to enable multi-stage manipulation tasks. Splat-MOVER consists of: (i) $\textit{ASK-Splat}$, a GSplat representation that distills latent codes for language semantics and grasp affordance into the 3D scene. ASK-Splat enables geometric, semantic, and affordance understanding of 3D scenes, which is critical for many robotics tasks; (ii) $\textit{SEE-Splat}$, a real-time scene-editing module using 3D semantic masking and infilling to visualize the motions of objects that result from robot interactions in the real-world. SEE-Splat creates a "digital twin" of the evolving environment throughout the manipulation task; and (iii) $\textit{Grasp-Splat}$, a grasp generation module that uses ASK-Splat and SEE-Splat to propose candidate grasps for open-world objects. ASK-Splat is trained in real-time from RGB images in a brief scanning phase prior to operation, while SEE-Splat and Grasp-Splat run in real-time during operation. We demonstrate the superior performance of Splat-MOVER in hardware experiments on a Kinova robot compared to two recent baselines in four single-stage, open-vocabulary manipulation tasks, as well as in four multi-stage manipulation tasks using the edited scene to reflect scene changes due to prior manipulation stages, which is not possible with the existing baselines. Code for this project and a link to the project page will be made available soon.</description>

      <title>BILTS: A novel bi-invariant local trajectory-shape descriptor for rigid-body motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the similarity between motions and established motion models is crucial for motion analysis, recognition, generation, and adaptation. To enhance similarity measurement across diverse contexts, invariant motion descriptors have been proposed. However, for rigid-body motion, few invariant descriptors exist that are bi-invariant, meaning invariant to both the body and world reference frames used to describe the motion. Moreover, their robustness to singularities is limited. This paper introduces a novel Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape descriptor (BILTS) and a corresponding dissimilarity measure. Mathematical relationships between BILTS and existing descriptors are derived, providing new insights into their properties. The paper also includes an algorithm to reproduce the motion from the BILTS descriptor, demonstrating its bidirectionality and usefulness for trajectory generation. Experimental validation using datasets of daily-life activities shows the higher robustness of the BILTS descriptor compared to the bi-invariant ISA descriptor. This higher robustness supports the further application of bi-invariant descriptors for motion recognition and generalization.</description>

      <title>Generative Planning with Fast Collision Checks for High Speed Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning about large numbers of diverse plans to achieve high speed navigation in cluttered environments remains a challenge for robotic systems even in the case of perfect perceptual information. Often, this is tackled by methods that iteratively optimize around a prior seeded trajectory and consequently restrict to local optima. We present a novel planning method using normalizing flows (NFs) to encode expert-styled motion primitives. We also present an accelerated collision checking framework that enables rejecting samples from the prior distribution before running them through the NF model for rapid sampling of collision-free trajectories. The choice of an NF as the generator permits a flexible way to encode diverse multi-modal behavior distributions while maintaining a smooth relation to the input space which allows approximating collision checks on NF inputs rather than outputs. We show comparable performance to model predictive path integral control in random cluttered environments and improved exit rates in a cul-de-sac environment. We conclude by discussing our plans for future work to improve both safety and performance of our controller.</description>

      <title>Physics-data hybrid dynamic model of a multi-axis manipulator for sensorless dexterous manipulation and high-performance motion planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of an implementable physics-data hybrid dynamic model for an articulated manipulator to plan and operate in various scenarios. Meanwhile, the physics-based and data-driven dynamic models are studied in this research to select the best model for planning. The physics-based model is constructed using the Lagrangian method, and the loss terms include inertia loss, viscous loss, and friction loss. As for the data-driven model, three methods are explored, including DNN, LSTM, and XGBoost. Our modeling results demonstrate that, after comprehensive hyperparameter optimization, the XGBoost architecture outperforms DNN and LSTM in accurately representing manipulator dynamics. The hybrid model with physics-based and data-driven terms has the best performance among all models based on the RMSE criteria, and it only needs about 24k of training data. In addition, we developed a virtual force sensor of a manipulator using the observed external torque derived from the dynamic model and designed a motion planner through the physics-data hybrid dynamic model. The external torque contributes to forces and torque on the end effector, facilitating interaction with the surroundings, while the internal torque governs manipulator motion dynamics and compensates for internal losses. By estimating external torque via the difference between measured joint torque and internal losses, we implement a sensorless control strategy which is demonstrated through a peg-in-hole task. Lastly, a learning-based motion planner based on the hybrid dynamic model assists in planning time-efficient trajectories for the manipulator. This comprehensive approach underscores the efficacy of integrating physics-based and data-driven models for advanced manipulator control and planning in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification Metrics for Deep Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When deploying deep neural networks on robots or other physical systems, the learned model should reliably quantify predictive uncertainty. A reliable uncertainty allows downstream modules to reason about the safety of its actions. In this work, we address metrics for evaluating such an uncertainty. Specifically, we focus on regression tasks, and investigate Area Under Sparsification Error (AUSE), Calibration Error, Spearman's Rank Correlation, and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL). Using synthetic regression datasets, we look into how those metrics behave under four typical types of uncertainty, their stability regarding the size of the test set, and reveal their strengths and weaknesses. Our results indicate that Calibration Error is the most stable and interpretable metric, but AUSE and NLL also have their respective use cases. We discourage the usage of Spearman's Rank Correlation for evaluating uncertainties and recommend replacing it with AUSE.</description>

      <title>Quality with Just Enough Diversity in Evolutionary Policy Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution Strategies (ES) are effective gradient-free optimization methods that can be competitive with gradient-based approaches for policy search. ES only rely on the total episodic scores of solutions in their population, from which they estimate fitness gradients for their update with no access to true gradient information. However this makes them sensitive to deceptive fitness landscapes, and they tend to only explore one way to solve a problem. Quality-Diversity methods such as MAP-Elites introduced additional information with behavior descriptors (BD) to return a population of diverse solutions, which helps exploration but leads to a large part of the evaluation budget not being focused on finding the best performing solution. Here we show that behavior information can also be leveraged to find the best policy by identifying promising search areas which can then be efficiently explored with ES. We introduce the framework of Quality with Just Enough Diversity (JEDi) which learns the relationship between behavior and fitness to focus evaluations on solutions that matter. When trying to reach higher fitness values, JEDi outperforms both QD and ES methods on hard exploration tasks like mazes and on complex control problems with large policies.</description>

      <title>Novel View Synthesis with Neural Radiance Fields for Industrial Robot Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become a rapidly growing research field with the potential to revolutionize typical photogrammetric workflows, such as those used for 3D scene reconstruction. As input, NeRFs require multi-view images with corresponding camera poses as well as the interior orientation. In the typical NeRF workflow, the camera poses and the interior orientation are estimated in advance with Structure from Motion (SfM). But the quality of the resulting novel views, which depends on different parameters such as the number and distribution of available images, as well as the accuracy of the related camera poses and interior orientation, is difficult to predict. In addition, SfM is a time-consuming pre-processing step, and its quality strongly depends on the image content. Furthermore, the undefined scaling factor of SfM hinders subsequent steps in which metric information is required. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of NeRFs for industrial robot applications. We propose an alternative to SfM pre-processing: we capture the input images with a calibrated camera that is attached to the end effector of an industrial robot and determine accurate camera poses with metric scale based on the robot kinematics. We then investigate the quality of the novel views by comparing them to ground truth, and by computing an internal quality measure based on ensemble methods. For evaluation purposes, we acquire multiple datasets that pose challenges for reconstruction typical of industrial applications, like reflective objects, poor texture, and fine structures. We show that the robot-based pose determination reaches similar accuracy as SfM in non-demanding cases, while having clear advantages in more challenging scenarios. Finally, we present first results of applying the ensemble method to estimate the quality of the synthetic novel view in the absence of a ground truth.</description>

      <title>TorchDriveEnv: A Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Autonomous Driving with Reactive, Realistic, and Diverse Non-Playable Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training, testing, and deployment, of autonomous vehicles requires realistic and efficient simulators. Moreover, because of the high variability between different problems presented in different autonomous systems, these simulators need to be easy to use, and easy to modify. To address these problems we introduce TorchDriveSim and its benchmark extension TorchDriveEnv. TorchDriveEnv is a lightweight reinforcement learning benchmark programmed entirely in Python, which can be modified to test a number of different factors in learned vehicle behavior, including the effect of varying kinematic models, agent types, and traffic control patterns. Most importantly unlike many replay based simulation approaches, TorchDriveEnv is fully integrated with a state of the art behavioral simulation API. This allows users to train and evaluate driving models alongside data driven Non-Playable Characters (NPC) whose initializations and driving behavior are reactive, realistic, and diverse. We illustrate the efficiency and simplicity of TorchDriveEnv by evaluating common reinforcement learning baselines in both training and validation environments. Our experiments show that TorchDriveEnv is easy to use, but difficult to solve.</description>

      <title>G$ \mathbf{^2} $VD Planner: Efficient Motion Planning With Grid-based Generalized Voronoi Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an efficient motion planning approach with grid-based generalized Voronoi diagrams (G$ \mathbf{^2} $VD) is newly proposed for mobile robots. Different from existing approaches, the novelty of this work is twofold: 1) a new state lattice-based path searching approach is proposed, in which the search space is reduced to a novel Voronoi corridor to further improve the search efficiency; 2) an efficient quadratic programming-based path smoothing approach is presented, wherein the clearance to obstacles is considered to improve the path clearance of hard-constrained path smoothing approaches. We validate the efficiency and smoothness of our approach in various challenging simulation scenarios and outdoor environments. It is shown that the computational efficiency is improved by 17.1% in the path searching stage, and path smoothing with the proposed approach is 6.6 times faster than an advanced sparse-banded structure-based path smoothing approach and 53.3 times faster than the popular timed-elastic-band planner.

      <description>arXiv:2306.17436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents an accurate and robust Lidar Inertial Odometry framework. We fuse LiDAR scans with IMU data using a tightly-coupled iterative error state Kalman filter for robust and fast localization. To achieve robust correspondence matching, we represent the points as a set of Gaussian distributions and evaluate the divergence in variance for outlier rejection. Based on the fitted distributions, a new residual metric is proposed for the filter-based Lidar inertial odometry, which demonstrates an improvement from merely quantifying distance to incorporating variance disparity, further enriching the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the residual metric. Due to the strategic design of the residual metric, we propose a simple yet effective voxel-solely mapping scheme, which only necessities the maintenance of one centroid and one covariance matrix for each voxel. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our framework for various data inputs and environments. To the benefit of the robotics society, we open source the code at https://github.com/Ji1Xingyu/lio_gvm.</description>

      <title>Value Approximation for Two-Player General-Sum Differential Games with State Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDEs numerically enables equilibrial feedback control in two-player differential games, yet faces the curse of dimensionality (CoD). While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in alleviating CoD in solving PDEs, vanilla PINNs fall short in learning discontinuous solutions due to their sampling nature, leading to poor safety performance of the resulting policies when values are discontinuous due to state or temporal logic constraints. In this study, we explore three potential solutions to this challenge: (1) a hybrid learning method that is guided by both supervisory equilibria and the HJI PDE, (2) a value-hardening method where a sequence of HJIs are solved with increasing Lipschitz constant on the constraint violation penalty, and (3) the epigraphical technique that lifts the value to a higher dimensional state space where it becomes continuous. Evaluations through 5D and 9D vehicle and 13D drone simulations reveal that the hybrid method outperforms others in terms of generalization and safety performance by taking advantage of both the supervisory equilibrium values and costates, and the low cost of PINN loss gradients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the current surge of interest in autonomous robotic systems, robot activity recognition within restricted indoor environments remains a formidable challenge. Conventional methods for detecting and recognizing robotic arms' activities often rely on vision-based or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, which require line-of-sight (LoS) access and may raise privacy concerns, for example, in nursing facilities. This research pioneers an innovative approach harnessing channel state information (CSI) measured from WiFi signals, subtly influenced by the activity of robotic arms. We developed an attention-based network to classify eight distinct activities performed by a Franka Emika robotic arm in different situations. Our proposed bidirectional vision transformer-concatenated (BiVTC) methodology aspires to predict robotic arm activities accurately, even when trained on activities with different velocities, all without dependency on external or internal sensors or visual aids. Considering the high dependency of CSI data on the environment motivated us to study the problem of sniffer location selection, by systematically changing the sniffer's location and collecting different sets of data. Finally, this paper also marks the first publication of the CSI data of eight distinct robotic arm activities, collectively referred to as RoboFiSense. This initiative aims to provide a benchmark dataset and baselines to the research community, fostering advancements in the field of robotics sensing.</description>

      <title>Risk-anticipatory autonomous driving strategies considering vehicles' weights, based on hierarchical deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to prevent accidents caused by drivers errors and reduce road traffic risks. Due to the nature of heavy vehicles, whose collisions cause more serious crashes, the weights of vehicles need to be considered when making driving strategies aimed at reducing the potential risks and their consequences in the context of autonomous driving. This study develops an autonomous driving strategy based on risk anticipation, considering the weights of surrounding vehicles and using hierarchical deep reinforcement learning. A risk indicator integrating surrounding vehicles weights, based on the risk field theory, is proposed and incorporated into autonomous driving decisions. A hybrid action space is designed to allow for left lane changes, right lane changes and car-following, which enables AVs to act more freely and realistically whenever possible. To solve the above hybrid decision-making problem, a hierarchical proximal policy optimization (HPPO) algorithm with an attention mechanism (AT-HPPO) is developed, providing great advantages in maintaining stable performance with high robustness and generalization. An indicator, potential collision energy in conflicts (PCEC), is newly proposed to evaluate the performance of the developed AV driving strategy from the perspective of the consequences of potential accidents. The performance evaluation results in simulation and dataset demonstrate that our model provides driving strategies that reduce both the likelihood and consequences of potential accidents, at the same time maintaining driving efficiency. The developed method is especially meaningful for AVs driving on highways, where heavy vehicles make up a high proportion of the traffic.</description>

      <title>Towards Validation of Autonomous Vehicles Across Scales using an Integrated Digital Twin Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle platforms of varying spatial scales are employed within the research and development spectrum based on space, safety and monetary constraints. However, deploying and validating autonomy algorithms across varying operational scales presents challenges due to scale-specific dynamics, sensor integration complexities, computational constraints, regulatory considerations, environmental variability, interaction with other traffic participants and scalability concerns. In such a milieu, this work focuses on developing a unified framework for modeling and simulating digital twins of autonomous vehicle platforms across different scales and operational design domains (ODDs) to help support the streamlined development and validation of autonomy software stacks. Particularly, this work discusses the development of digital twin representations of 4 autonomous ground vehicles, which span across 3 different scales and target 3 distinct ODDs. We study the adoption of these autonomy-oriented digital twins to deploy a common autonomy software stack with an aim of end-to-end map-based navigation to achieve the ODD-specific objective(s) for each vehicle. Finally, we also discuss the flexibility of the proposed framework to support virtual, hybrid as well as physical testing with seamless sim2real transfer.</description>

      <title>Synapse: Learning Preferential Concepts from Visual Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of preference learning, which aims to learn user-specific preferences (e.g., "good parking spot", "convenient drop-off location") from visual input. Despite its similarity to learning factual concepts (e.g., "red cube"), preference learning is a fundamentally harder problem due to its subjective nature and the paucity of person-specific training data. We address this problem using a new framework called Synapse, which is a neuro-symbolic approach designed to efficiently learn preferential concepts from limited demonstrations. Synapse represents preferences as neuro-symbolic programs in a domain-specific language (DSL) that operates over images, and leverages a novel combination of visual parsing, large language models, and program synthesis to learn programs representing individual preferences. We evaluate Synapse through extensive experimentation including a user case study focusing on mobility-related concepts in mobile robotics and autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that Synapse significantly outperforms existing baselines as well as its own ablations.

      <title>PoseINN: Realtime Visual-based Pose Regression and Localization with Invertible Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating ego-pose from cameras is an important problem in robotics with applications ranging from mobile robotics to augmented reality. While SOTA models are becoming increasingly accurate, they can still be unwieldy due to high computational costs. In this paper, we propose to solve the problem by using invertible neural networks (INN) to find the mapping between the latent space of images and poses for a given scene. Our model achieves similar performance to the SOTA while being faster to train and only requiring offline rendering of low-resolution synthetic data. By using normalizing flows, the proposed method also provides uncertainty estimation for the output. We also demonstrated the efficiency of this method by deploying the model on a mobile robot.</description>

      <title>CoverLib: Classifiers-equipped Experience Library by Iterative Problem Distribution Coverage Maximization for Domain-tuned Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Library-based methods are known to be very effective for fast motion planning by adapting an experience retrieved from a precomputed library. This article presents CoverLib, a principled approach for constructing and utilizing such a library. CoverLib iteratively adds an experience-classifier-pair to the library, where each classifier corresponds to an adaptable region of the experience within the problem space. This iterative process is an active procedure, as it selects the next experience based on its ability to effectively cover the uncovered region. During the query phase, these classifiers are utilized to select an experience that is expected to be adaptable for a given problem. Experimental results demonstrate that CoverLib effectively mitigates the trade-off between plannability and speed observed in global (e.g. sampling-based) and local (e.g. optimization-based) methods. As a result, it achieves both fast planning and high success rates over the problem domain. Moreover, due to its adaptation-algorithm-agnostic nature, CoverLib seamlessly integrates with various adaptation methods, including nonlinear programming-based and sampling-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Amodal Optical Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical flow estimation is very challenging in situations with transparent or occluded objects. In this work, we address these challenges at the task level by introducing Amodal Optical Flow, which integrates optical flow with amodal perception. Instead of only representing the visible regions, we define amodal optical flow as a multi-layered pixel-level motion field that encompasses both visible and occluded regions of the scene. To facilitate research on this new task, we extend the AmodalSynthDrive dataset to include pixel-level labels for amodal optical flow estimation. We present several strong baselines, along with the Amodal Flow Quality metric to quantify the performance in an interpretable manner. Furthermore, we propose the novel AmodalFlowNet as an initial step toward addressing this task. AmodalFlowNet consists of a transformer-based cost-volume encoder paired with a recurrent transformer decoder which facilitates recurrent hierarchical feature propagation and amodal semantic grounding. We demonstrate the tractability of amodal optical flow in extensive experiments and show its utility for downstream tasks such as panoptic tracking. We make the dataset, code, and trained models publicly available at http://amodal-flow.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</description>

      <title>iMTSP: Solving Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem with Imperative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP), where the goal is to find a set of tours, one for each agent, to collectively visit all the cities while minimizing the length of the longest tour. Though MTSP has been widely studied, obtaining near-optimal solutions for large-scale problems is still challenging due to its NP-hardness. Recent efforts in data-driven methods face challenges of the need for hard-to-obtain supervision and issues with high variance in gradient estimations, leading to slow convergence and highly suboptimal solutions. We address these issues by reformulating MTSP as a bilevel optimization problem, using the concept of imperative learning (IL). This involves introducing an allocation network that decomposes the MTSP into multiple single-agent traveling salesman problems (TSPs). The longest tour from these TSP solutions is then used to self-supervise the allocation network, resulting in a new self-supervised, bilevel, end-to-end learning framework, which we refer to as imperative MTSP (iMTSP). Additionally, to tackle the high-variance gradient issues during the optimization, we introduce a control variate-based gradient estimation algorithm. Our experiments showed that these innovative designs enable our gradient estimator to converge 20% faster than the advanced reinforcement learning baseline and find up to 80% shorter tour length compared with Google OR-Tools MTSP solver, especially in large-scale problems (e.g. 1000 cities and 15 agents).</description>
