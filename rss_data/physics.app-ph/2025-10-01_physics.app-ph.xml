      <title>Improved capabilities of the TurboGAP code for radiation induced cascade simulations: an illustration with silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TurboGAP is a software package designed for efficient molecular dynamics simulations using Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIP). In this work, we enhance the capabilities of TurboGAP for radiation damage simulations by implementing a two-temperature molecular dynamics model, based on electron density-dependent coupling of electronic and atomic subsystems. Additionally, we implement adaptive calculation of the timestep and grouping of atoms for cell-border cooling. Our implementation incorporates electronic stopping power either through a traditional friction-based model or a more realistic first-principles-derived model. By combining the computational efficiency of TurboGAP with the accuracy of GAP MLIP, we perform cascade simulations in silicon with primary knock-on atom (PKA) energies up to 10 keV. Our simulations scale to systems containing up to 1 million atoms. We study the generation and clustering of radiation-induced defects. We also calculate ion-beam mixing and compare our results with the experimental data, discussing how the GAP-MLIP along with the inclusion of a realistic electronic stopping model improves the prediction of experimental mixing values.</description>

      <title>Increase in packing density during multi-layer powder spreading: An experimental and numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A custom apparatus designed to isolate and replicate the spreading process of metal powder in additive manufacturing demonstrates a sudden and unexplained increase in packing density beyond layers 5 to 10. We replicate the experiments that lead to densification with the discrete element method (DEM) using \lethe{}, an open-source software framework. We show that large-scale multi-layer DEM simulations are able to reproduce the densification observed experimentally. Using the Lagrangian simulation results, we highlight significant particle displacement in the powder bed at lower layer number, accompanied by static zones generated by the vertical wall surrounding the powder bed. The amplitude of the densification and the layer number at which it starts to occur is correlated to the distance between those two vertical walls which delimit the powder spreading area. This study addresses the gap between mono-layer powder spreading studies on hard-flat surfaces and the actual metal powder-based additive manufacturing processes by providing a better understanding of how the powder bed behaves during multi-layer spreading.</description>

      <title>Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.</description>

      <title>Fingerprinting Organic Molecules for the Inverse Design of Two-Dimensional Hybrid Perovskites with Target Energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted workflows have transformed materials discovery, enabling rapid exploration of chemical spaces of functional materials. Endowed with extraordinary optoelectronic properties, two-dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites represent an exciting frontier, but current efforts to design 2D perovskites rely heavily on trial-and-error and expert intuition approaches, leaving most of the chemical space unexplored and compromising the design of hybrid materials with desired properties. Here, we introduce an inverse design workflow for Dion-Jacobson perovskites that is built on an invertible fingerprint representation for millions of conjugated diammonium organic spacers. By incorporating high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations, interpretable machine learning, and synthesis feasibility screening, we identified new organic spacer candidates with deterministic energy level alignment between the organic and the inorganic motifs in the 2D hybrid perovskites. These results highlight the power of integrating invertible, physically meaningful molecular representations into AI-assisted design, streamlining the property-targeted design of hybrid materials.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Impacted Beam Statistics and Image Topology with Lorentz Dipole Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a rigorous statistical and geometric framework for analyzing turbulence-impacted beam propagation and image topology with results obtained using a PMMA slab. The approach models beam intensity distributions as n-dimensional data set represented through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), embedding them into the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. By employing information geometric tools, geodesic distances, and affine-invariant Riemannian metrics, we establish a principled methodology for quantifying similarity and dissimilarity among beam images. Experimental results demonstrate topological distance trends, distance statistics, and correlation measures for different turbulence scenarios, including polarized and unpolarized cases. Histograms of distance statistics reveal stable statistical features, with correlation coefficients highlighting the turbulence-induced variability in PMMA-based beam propagation. The framework not only provides a systematic foundation for analyzing optical beam statistics under turbulence but also opens avenues for advanced applications such as deep learning-based feature reduction, image compression, and secure free-space optical (FSO) communication. Future directions include refining the GMM-EM based distance measures, comparative scatter analysis, and developing robust statistical tools for turbulence imaging. Overall, this study bridges theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and potential technological applications in adaptive and applied optics.</description>

      <title>Ingress Cryogenic Receivers Toward Scalable Quantum Information Processing: Theory and System Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current control techniques for cryogenically cooled qubits are realized with coaxial cables, posing multiple challenges in terms of cost, thermal load, size, and long-term scalability. Emerging approaches to tackle this issue include cryogenic CMOS electronics at 4 K, and photonic links for direct qubit control. In this paper, we propose a multiplexed all-passive cryogenic high frequency direct detection control platform (cryo-HFDD). The proposed classical interface for direct qubit control utilizes optical or sub-THz bands. We present the possible tradeoffs of this platform, and compare it with current state-of-the-art cryogenic CMOS and conventional coaxial approaches. We assess the feasibility of adopting these efficient links for a wide range of microwave qubit power levels. Specifically, we estimate the heat load to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio SNR considering different noise sources, component losses, as well as link density. We show that multiplexed photonic receivers at 4 K can aggressively scale the control of thousands of qubits. This opens the door for low cost scalable quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of the photochromic effect in oxygen-containing rare-earth hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetics of the photochromic reaction of oxygen-containing rare-earth hydrides is commonly described by an exponential function assuming a single-step process. In this paper, we elaborate on the origin of the photochromic effect in oxygen-containing rare-earth metal hydrides, considering the kinetics of the reaction as a two-step process. We show that the fit to the experimental data is improved drastically when two processes that cause the photodarkening are assumed: a fast reaction rate-limited - for example, electronic or local - process and a slow, e.g. diffusion-limited process.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of YSO, GaGG, and BGO scintillators coupled to a SiPM array for gamma-ray spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compact gamma-ray detector module was developed and characterized for spectroscopic applications across a wide energy range. The detector comprises a 4x4 array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs, Hamamatsu MPPC S13360-3050) coupled with three different inorganic scintillators (YSO, GaGG, BGO). The performance of the detector was evaluated over an energy range from 32 keV to 2500 keV using various standard gamma-ray point sources ({241}Am, {137}Cs, {22}Na, {60}Co, {228}Th). All three detector configurations demonstrated linearity between pulse height and gamma-ray energy over most of the tested range. GAGG exhibited the most consistent linear behavior up to 2500 keV. YSO with a faster decay constant showed linearity up to ~2000 keV, followed by slight saturation effects likely due to SiPM microcell occupancy limits at higher photon flux. BGO, characterized by a low light output and longer decay time, demonstrated stable linearity up to 2500 keV but reduced sensitivity below 300 keV. The measured energy resolution at 662 keV was 8.17% for GAGG, 9.3% for YSO, and 10.2% for BGO, consistent with their light yield and photon detection efficiency (PDE) - matching characteristics. The obtained results showed the trade-offs between scintillator materials in terms of energy resolution, dynamic range, and linearity, and confirm the suitability of the tested configurations for compact gamma-ray spectroscopy applications across the studied energy range.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction of Photons for Quantum Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, is vital for the realization of, e.g., quantum networks, distributed quantum computing, and quantum repeaters. The microwave-to-optical quantum transduction is of particular interest in the field of superconducting quantum computing, since interconnecting dilution refrigerators is considered inevitable for realizing large-scale quantum computers with fault-tolerance. In this review, we overview recent theoretical and experimental studies on the quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons. We describe a generic theory for the quantum transduction employing the input-output formalism, from which the essential quantities characterizing the transduction, i.e., the expressions for the transduction efficiency, the added noise, and the transduction bandwidth are derived. We review the major transduction methods that have been experimentally demonstrated, focusing the transduction via the optomechanical effect, the electro-optic effect, the magneto-optic effect, and the atomic ensembles. We also briefly review the recent experimental progress on the quantum transduction from superconducting qubit to optical photon, which is an important step toward the quantum state transfer between distant superconducting qubits interconnected over optical fibers.</description>

      <title>Low-loss polarization-maintaining router for single and entangled photons at a telecom wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon polarization serves as an essential quantum information carrier in quantum information and measurement applications. Routing of arbitrarily polarized single photons and polarization-entangled photons is a crucial technology for scaling up quantum information applications. Here, we demonstrate a low-loss, noiseless, polarization-maintaining routing of arbitrarily polarized single photons and, crucially, multi-photon entangled states where the entanglement is encoded in orthogonal polarization bases, at the telecom L-band. Our interferometer-based router is constructed by optics with a low angle of incidence and cross-aligned electro-optic crystals, achieving the polarization-maintaining operation with a minimal number of optical components. We demonstrate the routing of arbitrarily-polarized heralded single photons with a 0.057 dB (1.3%) loss, a $&gt;$ 22 dB switching extinction ratio, and $&gt;$ 99% polarization process fidelity to ideal identity operation. Moreover, the high-quality router achieves the routing of two-photon N00N-type entangled states with a highly maintained interference visibility of $\approx$ 97%. The demonstrated router scheme preserving multi-photon polarization state paves the way toward polarization-encoded photonic quantum networks as well as multi-photon entanglement synthesis via spatial- and time-multiplexing techniques.</description>

      <title>Robot Conga: A Leader-Follower Walking Approach to Sequential Path Following in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.</description>
