      <title>MPCR: Multi- and Mixed-Precision Computations Package in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational statistics has traditionally utilized double-precision (64-bit) data structures and full-precision operations, resulting in higher-than-necessary accuracy for certain applications. Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring low-precision options that could reduce computational complexity while still achieving the required level of accuracy. This trend has been amplified by new hardware such as NVIDIA's Tensor Cores in their V100, A100, and H100 GPUs, which are optimized for mixed-precision computations, Intel CPUs with Deep Learning (DL) boost, Google Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), ARM CPUs, and others. However, using lower precision may introduce numerical instabilities and accuracy issues. Nevertheless, some applications have shown robustness to low-precision computations, leading to new multi- and mixed-precision algorithms that balance accuracy and computational cost. To address this need, we introduce MPCR, a novel R package that supports three different precision types (16-, 32-, and 64-bit) and their combinations, along with its usage in commonly-used Frequentist/Bayesian statistical examples. The MPCR package is written in C++ and integrated into R through the \pkg{Rcpp} package, enabling highly optimized operations in various precisions.</description>

      <title>Sampling From Multiscale Densities With Delayed Rejection Generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of probabilistic programming languages, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has become the mainstay of applied Bayesian inference. However HMC still struggles to sample from densities with multiscale geometry: a large step size is needed to efficiently explore low curvature regions while a small step size is needed to accurately explore high curvature regions. We introduce the delayed rejection generalized HMC (DR-G-HMC) sampler that overcomes this challenge by employing dynamic step size selection, inspired by differential equation solvers. In a single sampling iteration, DR-G-HMC sequentially makes proposals with geometrically decreasing step sizes if necessary. This simulates Hamiltonian dynamics with increasing fidelity that, in high curvature regions, generates proposals with a higher chance of acceptance. DR-G-HMC also makes generalized HMC competitive by decreasing the number of rejections which otherwise cause inefficient backtracking and prevents directed movement. We present experiments to demonstrate that DR-G-HMC (1) correctly samples from multiscale densities, (2) makes generalized HMC methods competitive with the state of the art No-U-Turn sampler, and (3) is robust to tuning parameters.</description>

      <title>You Only Accept Samples Once: Fast, Self-Correcting Stochastic Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce YOASOVI, an algorithm for performing fast, self-correcting stochastic optimization for Variational Inference (VI) on large Bayesian heirarchical models. To accomplish this, we take advantage of available information on the objective function used for stochastic VI at each iteration and replace regular Monte Carlo sampling with acceptance sampling. Rather than spend computational resources drawing and evaluating over a large sample for the gradient, we draw only one sample and accept it with probability proportional to the expected improvement in the objective. The following paper develops two versions of the algorithm: the first one based on a naive intuition, and another building up the algorithm as a Metropolis-type scheme. Empirical results based on simulations and benchmark datasets for multivariate Gaussian mixture models show that YOASOVI consistently converges faster (in clock time) and within better optimal neighborhoods than both regularized Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo VI algorithms.</description>

      <title>Second-order differential operators, stochastic differential equations and Brownian motions on embedded manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We specify the conditions when a manifold M embedded in an inner product space E is an invariant manifold of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) on E, linking it with the notion of second-order differential operators on M. When M is given a Riemannian metric, we derive a simple formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator in terms of the gradient and Hessian on E and construct the Riemannian Brownian motions on M as solutions of conservative Stratonovich and Ito SDEs on E. We derive explicitly the SDE for Brownian motions on several important manifolds in applications, including left-invariant matrix Lie groups using embedded coordinates. Numerically, we propose three simulation schemes to solve SDEs on manifolds. In addition to the stochastic projection method, to simulate Riemannian Brownian motions, we construct a second-order tangent retraction of the Levi-Civita connection using a given E-tubular retraction. We also propose the retractive Euler-Maruyama method to solve a SDE, taking into account the second-order term of a tangent retraction. We provide software to implement the methods in the paper, including Brownian motions of the manifolds discussed. We verify numerically that on several compact Riemannian manifolds, the long-term limit of Brownian simulation converges to the uniform distributions, suggesting a method to sample Riemannian uniform distributions</description>

      <title>Variational Pseudo Marginal Methods for Jet Reconstruction in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing jets, which provide vital insights into the properties and histories of subatomic particles produced in high-energy collisions, is a main problem in data analyses in collider physics. This intricate task deals with estimating the latent structure of a jet (binary tree) and involves parameters such as particle energy, momentum, and types. While Bayesian methods offer a natural approach for handling uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge, they face significant challenges due to the super-exponential growth of potential jet topologies as the number of observed particles increases. To address this, we introduce a Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo approach for inferring jet latent structures. As a second contribution, we leverage the resulting estimator to develop a variational inference algorithm for parameter learning. Building on this, we introduce a variational family using a pseudo-marginal framework for a fully Bayesian treatment of all variables, unifying the generative model with the inference process. We illustrate our method's effectiveness through experiments using data generated with a collider physics generative model, highlighting superior speed and accuracy across a range of tasks.</description>

      <title>Sampling in Unit Time with Kernel Fisher-Rao Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new mean-field ODE and corresponding interacting particle systems (IPS) for sampling from an unnormalized target density. The IPS are gradient-free, available in closed form, and only require the ability to sample from a reference density and compute the (unnormalized) target-to-reference density ratio. The mean-field ODE is obtained by solving a Poisson equation for a velocity field that transports samples along the geometric mixture of the two densities, which is the path of a particular Fisher-Rao gradient flow. We employ a RKHS ansatz for the velocity field, which makes the Poisson equation tractable and enables discretization of the resulting mean-field ODE over finite samples. The mean-field ODE can be additionally be derived from a discrete-time perspective as the limit of successive linearizations of the Monge-Amp\`ere equations within a framework known as sample-driven optimal transport. We introduce a stochastic variant of our approach and demonstrate empirically that our IPS can produce high-quality samples from varied target distributions, outperforming comparable gradient-free particle systems and competitive with gradient-based alternatives.</description>
