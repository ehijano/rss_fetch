      <title>$p$-adic symplectic geometry of integrable systems and Weierstrass-Williamson theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the foundations of the local linear symplectic geometry of $p$-adic integrable systems on $p$-adic analytic symplectic $4$-dimensional manifolds, by classifiying all their possible local linear models. In order to do this we develop a new approach, of independent interest, to the theory of Weierstrass and Williamson concerning the diagonalization of real matrices by real symplectic matrices, which we show can be generalized to $p$-adic matrices, leading to a classification of real $(2n)$-by-$(2n)$ matrices and of $p$-adic $2$-by-$2$ and $4$-by-$4$ matrix normal forms. A combination of these results and the Hardy-Ramanujan formula shows that both the number of $p$-adic matrix normal forms and the number of local linear models of $p$-adic integrable systems grow almost exponentially with their dimensions, in strong contrast with the real case. Although the paper deals mostly with matrices and systems whose singularities are non-degenerate, we include several classifications in the degenerate $p$-adic case, for which the literature is limited even in the real case. The paper also includes a number of results concerning symplectic linear algebra over arbitrary fields in arbitrary dimensions as well as applications to $p$-adic mechanical systems and singularity theory for $p$-adic analytic maps on $4$-manifolds. These results fit in a program, proposed a decade ago by Voevodsky, Warren and the second author, to develop a $p$-adic theory of integrable systems with the goal of later implementing it using proof assistants.</description>

      <title>Symplectic log Kodaira dimension $-\infty$, affine-ruledness and unicuspidal rational curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a closed symplectic $4$-manifold $(X,\omega)$, a collection $D$ of embedded symplectic submanifolds satisfying certain normal crossing conditions is called a symplectic divisor. In this paper, we consider the pair $(X,\omega,D)$ with symplectic log Kodaira dimension $-\infty$ in the spirit of Li-Zhang. We introduce the notion of symplectic affine-ruledness, which characterizes the divisor complement $X\setminus D$ as being foliated by symplectic punctured spheres. We establish a symplectic analogue of a theorem by Fujita-Miyanishi-Sugie-Russell in the algebraic settings which describes smooth open algebraic surfaces with $\overline{\kappa}=-\infty$ as containing a Zariski open subset isomorphic to the product between a curve and the affine line. When $X$ is a rational manifold, the foliation is given by certain unicuspidal rational curves of index one with cusp singularities located at the intersection point in $D$. We utilize the correspondence between such singular curves and embedded curves in its normal crossing resolution recently highlighted by McDuff-Siegel, and also a criterion for the existence of embedded curves in the relative settings by McDuff-Opshtein. Another main technical input is Zhang's curve cone theorem for tamed almost complex $4$-manifolds, which is crucial in reducing the complexity of divisors. We also investigate the symplectic deformation properties of divisors and show that such pairs are deformation equivalent to K\"ahler pairs. As a corollary, the restriction of the symplectic structure $\omega$ on an open dense subset in the divisor complement $X\setminus D$ is deformation equivalent to the standard product symplectic structure.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for toric GIT quotients via Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal X=[(\mathbb C^r\setminus Z)/G]$ be a toric Fano orbifold. We compute the Fourier transform of the $G$-equivariant quantum cohomology central charge of any $G$-equivariant line bundle on $\mathbb C^r$ with respect to certain choice of parameters. This gives the quantum cohomology central charge of the corresponding line bundle on $\mathcal X$, while in the oscillatory integral expression it becomes the oscillatory integral in the mirror Landau-Ginzburg mirror of $\mathcal X$. Moving these parameters to real numbers simultaneously deforms the integration cycle to the mirror Lagrangian cycle of that line bundle. This computation produces a new proof the mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for $\mathcal X$.</description>

      <title>Hochschild cohomology of the Fukaya category via Floer cohomology with coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a monotone Lagrangian $L$ in a compact symplectic manifold $X$, we construct a commutative diagram relating the closed-open string map $CO_\lambda : QH^*(X) \to HH^*(\mathcal{F}(X)_\lambda)$ to a variant of the length-zero closed-open map on $L$ incorporating $\mathbf{k}[H_1(L; \mathbb{Z})]$ coefficients, denoted $CO^0_\mathbf{L}$. The former is categorically important but very difficult to compute, whilst the latter is geometrically natural and amenable to calculation. We further show that, after a suitable completion, injectivity of $CO^0_\mathbf{L}$ implies injectivity of $CO_\lambda$. Via Sheridan's version of Abouzaid's generation criterion, this gives a powerful tool for proving split-generation of the Fukaya category. We illustrate this by showing that the real part of a monotone toric manifold (of minimal Chern number at least 2) split-generates the Fukaya category in characteristic 2. We also give a short new proof (modulo foundational assumptions in the non-monotone case) that the Fukaya category of an arbitrary compact toric manifold is split-generated by toric fibres.</description>
