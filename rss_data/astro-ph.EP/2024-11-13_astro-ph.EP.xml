      <title>Peering into the black box: forward-modeling the uncertainty budget of high-resolution spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS; R &gt;~ 15,000) is a powerful complement to space-based studies of exoplanet atmospheres. By resolving individual spectral lines, HRCCS can precisely measure chemical abundance ratios, directly constrain atmospheric dynamics, and robustly probe multidimensional physics. But the subtleties of HRCCS datasets -- e.g., the lack of exoplanetary spectra visible by eye and the statistically complex process of telluric removal -- can make interpreting them difficult. In this work, we seek to clarify the uncertainty budget of HRCCS with a forward-modeling approach. We present a HRCCS observation simulator, scope (https://github.com/arjunsavel/scope), that incorporates spectral contributions from the exoplanet, star, tellurics, and instrument. This tool allows us to control the underlying dataset, enabling controlled experimentation with complex HRCCS methods. Simulating a fiducial hot Jupiter dataset (WASP-77Ab emission with IGRINS), we first confirm via multiple tests that the commonly used principal components analysis does not bias the planetary signal when few components are used. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mildly varying tellurics and moderate wavelength solution errors induce only mild decreases in HRCCS detection significance. However, limiting-case, strongly varying tellurics can bias the retrieved velocities and gas abundances. Additionally, in the low-SNR limit, constraints on gas abundances become highly non-Gaussian. Our investigation of the uncertainties and potential biases inherent in HRCCS data analysis enables greater confidence in scientific results from this maturing method.</description>

      <title>The Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey: X-ray to infrared Spectral Energy Distributions of a representative sample of M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 5-1x10^7 Angstrom spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for twelve M dwarf stars covering spectral types M0-M8. Our SEDs are provided for community use as a sequel to the Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) survey. The twelve stars include eight known exoplanet hosts and four stars chosen to fill out key parameter space in spectral type and rotation period. The SEDs are constructed from Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy and XMM Newton, Chandra and/or Swift X-ray observations and completed with various model data, including Lyman alpha reconstructions, PHOENIX optical models, APEC coronal models and Differential Emission Measure models in the currently-unobservable Extreme Ultraviolet. We provide a complete overview of the Mega-MUSCLES program, including a description of the observations, models, and SED construction. The SEDs are available as MAST High-Level Science Products and we describe the various data products here. We also present ensemble measurements from our sample that are of particular relevance to exoplanet science, including the high-energy fluxes in the habitable zone and the FUV/NUV ratio. Combined with MUSCLES, Mega-MUSCLES provides SEDs covering a wide range of M\,dwarf spectral types and ages such that suitable proxies for any M dwarf planet host of interest may be found in our sample. However, we find that ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes can vary even between stars with similar parameters, such that observations of each exoplanet host star will remain the gold standard for interpreting exoplanet atmosphere observations.</description>

      <title>The Volatile Composition and Activity Evolution of Main-Belt Comet 358P/PANSTARRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of water vapor associated with main-belt comet 358P/PANSTARRS on UT 2024 January 8-9 using the NIRSPEC instrument aboard JWST. We derive a water production rate of Q(H2O)=(5.0+/-0.2)x10^25 molecules/s, marking only the second direct detection of sublimation products of any kind from a main-belt comet, after 238P/Read. Similar to 238P, we find a remarkable absence of hypervolatile species, finding Q(CO2)&lt;7.6x10^22 molecules/s, corresponding to Q(CO2)/Q(H2O)&lt;0.2%. Upper limits on CH3OH and CO emission are also estimated. Photometry from ground-based observations show that the dust coma brightened and faded slowly over ~250 days in 2023-2024, consistent with photometric behavior observed in 2012-2013, but also indicate a ~2.5x decline in the dust production rate between these two periods. Dynamical dust modeling shows that the coma's morphology as imaged by JWST's NIRCAM instrument on 2023 November 22 can be reproduced by asymmetric dust emission from a nucleus with a mid-range obliquity (~80 deg) with a steady-state mass loss rate of ~0.8 kg/s. Finally, we find similar Afrho-to-gas ratios of log10(Afrho/Q(H2O))=-24.8+/-0.2 for 358P and log10(Afrho/QH2O)=-24.4+/-0.2 for 238P, suggesting that Afrho could serve as an effective proxy for estimating water production rates in other active main-belt comets. The confirmation of water vapor outgassing in both main-belt comets observed by JWST to date reinforces the use of recurrent activity near perihelion as an indicator of sublimation-driven activity in active asteroids.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Exoplanet Atmospheres: A Detectability Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the detectability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under diverse planetary conditions, aiming to identify promising targets for future observations of planetary atmospheres. Our primary goal is to determine the minimum detectable mass fractions of PAHs on each studied planet. We integrate the one-dimensional self consistent model petitCODE with petitRADTRANS, a radiative transfer model, to simulate the transmission spectra of these planets. Subsequently, we employ the PandExo noise simulator using the NIRSpec PRISM instrument aboard the JWST to assess the observability. Then, we conduct a Bayesian analysis through the MULTINEST code. Our findings illustrate that variations in C/O ratios and planet temperatures significantly influence the transmission spectra and the detectability of PAHs. Our results show that planets with [Fe/H]=0 and 1, C/O=0.55, and temperatures around 1200 K are the most promising for detecting PAHs, with detectable mass fractions as low as 10$^{-7}$, or one thousandth of the ISM abundance level. For colder planets with lower metallicities and C/O ratios, as well as hotter planets with carbon-rich atmospheres, PAHs can be detected at abundances around 10$^{-6}$. These results aid our strategy for selecting targets to study PAHs in the atmospheres of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Librations and obliquity of the largest moons of Uranus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the discovery of several ocean worlds in the solar system, and the selection of Uranus as the highest priority objective by the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, the five largest moons of Uranus (Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon) have been receiving renewed attention as they may also harbor a subsurface ocean. We assess how rotation measurements could help confirm the internal differentiation of the bodies and detect internal oceans if any. Because of the time-varying gravitational torque of Uranus on the flattened shape of its synchronous satellites, the latter librate with respect to their mean rotation and precess with a non zero obliquity. For a range of interior models with a rocky core surrounded by a hydrosphere, either solid or divided into an outer ice shell with a liquid ocean underneath, we compute their diurnal libration amplitude and obliquity.</description>

      <title>A close outer companion to the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-2109 b?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters with close-by planetary companions are rare, with only a handful of them having been discovered so far. This could be due to their suggested dynamical histories, leading to the possible ejection of other planets. TOI-2109 b is special in this regard because it is the hot Jupiter with the closest relative separation from its host star, being separated by less than 2.3 stellar radii. Unexpectedly, transit timing measurements from recently obtained CHEOPS observations show low amplitude transit-timing variations (TTVs). We aim to search for signs of orbital decay and to characterise the apparent TTVs, trying to gain information about a possible companion. We fit the newly obtained CHEOPS light curves using TLCM and extract the resulting mid-transit timings. Successively, we use these measurements in combination with TESS and archival photometric data and radial velocity data to estimate the rate of tidal orbital decay of TOI-2109 b, as well as characterise the TTVs using the N-body code TRADES and the photodynamical approach of PyTTV. We find tentative evidence at $3\sigma$ for orbital decay in the TOI-2109 system, when we correct the mid-transit timings using the best-fitting sinusoidal model of the TTVs. We do not detect additional transits in the available photometric data, but find evidence towards the authenticity of the apparent TTVs, indicating a close-by, outer companion with $P_\mathrm{c} &gt; 1.125\,$d. Due to the fast rotation of the star, the new planetary candidate cannot be detected in the available radial velocity (RV) measurements, and its parameters can only be loosely constrained by our joint TTV and RV modelling. TOI-2109 could join a small group of rare hot Jupiter systems that host close-by planetary companions, only one of which (WASP-47 b) has an outer companion. More high-precision photometric measurements are necessary to confirm the planetary companion.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Atmosphere of WASP-6 b with JWST NIRSpec PRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been detected throughout the universe where they play essential roles in the evolution of their environments. For example, they are believed to affect atmospheric loss rates of close-in planets and might contribute to the pre-biotic chemistry and emergence of life. Despite their importance, the study of PAHs in exoplanet atmospheres has been limited. We aim to evaluate the possibility of detecting PAHs on exoplanets considering future observations using JWST's NIRSpec PRISM mode. The hot Saturn WASP-6 b shows properties that are consistent with a potential PAH presence and is thus used as a case study for this work. Here, we compare the likelihoods of various synthetic haze species and their combinations with the influence of PAHs on the transmission spectrum of WASP-6 b. This is possible by applying the atmospheric retrieval code petitRADTRANS to a collection of data from previous observations. Subsequently, by exploring synthetic, single transit JWST spectra of this planet that include PAHs, we assess if these molecules can be detected in the near future. Previous observations support the presence of cloud/haze species in the spectrum of WASP-6 b. While this may include PAHs, the current data do not confirm their existence unambiguously. Our research suggests that utilizing the JWST for future observations could lead to a notable advancement in the study of PAHs. Employing this telescope, we find that a PAH abundance of approximately 0.1 per cent of the ISM value could be robustly detectable.</description>

      <title>The impact of water clouds on the prospective emission spectrum of Teegarden's Star b as observed by LIFE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-transiting terrestrial planets will be accessible by upcoming observatories of which LIFE is an example. Planet b orbiting Teegarden's Star is one of the optimal targets for such missions. We use a one-dimensional atmospheric model with real-gas radiation, a multi-species pseudo-adiabatic convection-condensation scheme, and a water cloud scheme, to estimate the impact of the cloud coverage on the emission spectrum of the target, as well as to assess how sensitive LIFE could be to changes in outgoing flux caused by these clouds. Though the emergent flux decreases with a higher cloud coverage, it does not decrease by more than one order of magnitude as the coverage increases from 0% to 90%. This allows LIFE to retain a high sensitivity to the cloud cover fraction for wavelengths longer than 7 microns. In this spectral range, with at least 1 bar of N2, LIFE is able to distinguish cloud cover fractions as small as 10% given an integration time of 24 hours, and yields much better precision with a week-long integration. An integration time of one week also allows the resolution of local variations in spectral flux, which can lead to an easier molecule identification. This ability remains if the planet is a CO2-dominated Venus analog. Partial pressures of N2 lower than 1 bar may create a degeneracy with the cloud cover fraction. LIFE shows promising potential for detecting and characterizing atmospheres even with a high cloud coverage, and retaining a fine sensitivity to relatively small differences in cloud cover fractions.</description>

      <title>The discovery and characterization of minimoon 2024 PT$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimoons are asteroids that become temporarily captured by the Earth-Moon system. We present the discovery of 2024 PT$_5$, a minimoon discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) Sutherland telescope on 2024 August 7. The minimoon with heliocentric semi-major axis, $a$$\sim$1.01 au, and perihelion, $q$$\sim$0.99 au, became captured by the Earth-Moon system on 2024 September 29 and left on 2024 November 25 UTC. Visible g, r, i, and Z spectrophotometry was obtained using Gemini North/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on 2024 September 27. The color indices are g-r = 0.58$\pm$0.04, r-i = 0.29$\pm$0.04, i-Z = -0.27$\pm$0.06, and the spectrum best matches lunar rock samples followed by S-complex asteroids. Assuming an albedo of 0.21 and using our measured absolute magnitude of 28.64$\pm$0.04, 2024 PT$_5$ has a diameter of 5.4$\pm$1.3 m. We also detect variations in the lightcurve of 2024 PT$_5$ with a 0.28$\pm$0.07 magnitude amplitude and a double-peaked period of $\sim$2600$\pm$500 s. We improve the orbital solution of 2024 PT$_5$ with our astrometry and estimate the effect of radiation pressure on its deriving an area-to-mass ratio of 7.02$\pm$2.05$\times$10$^{-5}$ m$^2$/kg, implying a density of $\sim$3.9$\pm$2.1 g/cm$^3$, compatible with having a rocky composition. If we assume 2024 PT$_5$ is from the NEO population, its most likely sources are resonances in the inner Main Belt by comparing its orbit with the NEO population model, though this does not exclude a lunar origin.</description>

      <title>Chemical Fingerprints of M Dwarfs: High-Resolution Spectroscopy on 31 M Dwarfs with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the methodology introduced by Jahandar et al. (2024) to determine the effective temperature and chemical abundances of 31 slowly-rotating solar neighborhood M dwarfs (M1-M5) using high-resolution spectra from CFHT/SPIRou. This group includes 10 M dwarfs in binary systems with FGK primaries of known metallicity from optical measurements. By testing our $T_{\rm eff}$ method on various synthetic models, we find a consistent inherent synthetic uncertainty of $\sim$10 K at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. Additionally, we find that our results align with interferometric measurements, showing a consistent residual of $-$29 $\pm$ 31 K. Taking the inherent uncertainties into account, we infer the $T_{\rm eff}$ values of our targets and find an excellent agreement with previous optical and NIR studies. Our high-resolution chemical analysis examines hundreds of absorption lines using $\chi^2$ minimization using PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. We present elemental abundances for up to 10 different elements, including refractory elements such as Si, Mg, and Fe, which are important for modelling the interior structure of exoplanets. In binary systems, we find an average [Fe/H] of $-$0.15 $\pm$ 0.08 for M dwarfs, marginally lower than the reported metallicity of $-$0.06 $\pm$ 0.18 for the FGK primaries from Mann et al. (2013a). We also observe slightly sub-solar chemistry for various elements in our non-binary M dwarfs, most notably for O, C, and K abundances. In particular, we find an average metallicity of $-$0.11 $\pm$ 0.16 lower but still consistent with the typical solar metallicity of FGK stars (e.g. [Fe/H] = 0.04 $\pm$ 0.20 from Brewer et al. 2016). This study highlights significant discrepancies in various major M dwarf surveys likely related to differences in the methodologies employed.</description>

Although these molecules' origin is believed to be the cometary nucleus, they can be partially synthesised in the coma. We studied organic molecules' nucleus versus coma origins for various initial conditions, using a multifluid chemical-hydrodynamical model and an updated chemical network. For the study, we considered four comets [C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake), C/2012 F6 (Lemmon), C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy), and C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy)] due to their relatively high activity and observation of large number organics species. We emphasised on the C-H-O and N-bearing species, including the simplest amino acid, glycine. We discuss the formation pathways of the organics and the conditions for their formation in the coma and find that the abundance varies from one comet to another due to differences in the initial conditions, relative abundances of the reactants and temperature. We compare the organic abundances when they are present as parent volatiles to their formation solely due to gas-phase chemistry. Their abundance purely due to the coma chemistry is moderately to significantly lower compared to that when they are parent volatiles. However, we find that the production rates of some of the coma-synthesised organic molecules can reach peak values of ~ 1e22 - 1e26 molecules/s, which is in the realm of detection by in situ/space-based observations, and can therefore be important considering future missions to comets. We also compare our modeled abundances with those observed in 67P/C-G by Rosetta, which detected several organics at a large heliocentric distance and low production rate.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets Across Galactic Stellar Populations with PLATO: Estimating Exoplanet Yields Around FGK Stars for the Thin Disk, Thick Disk and Stellar Halo</title>

Abstract: This study aims to assess the potential of the upcoming PLATO mission to investigate exoplanet populations around stars in diverse Galactic environments, specifically focusing on the Milky Way thin disk, thick disk, and stellar halo. We aim to quantify PLATOs ability to detect planets in each environment and determine how these observations could constrain planet formation models. Beginning from the all-sky PLATO Input Catalog, we kinematically classify the 2.4 million FGK stars into their respective Galactic components. For the sub-sample of stars in the long-observation LOPS2 and LOPN1 PLATO fields, we estimate planet occurrence rates using the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis (NGPPS) dataset. Combining these estimates with a PLATO detection efficiency model, we predicted the expected planet yields for each Galactic environment during a nominal 2+2 year mission. Based on our analysis, PLATO is likely to detect at least 400 exoplanets around the alpha-enriched thick disk stars. The majority of those planets are expected to be Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes with radii between 2 and 10 Earth radii and orbital periods between 2 and 50 days, ideal for studying the link between the radius valley and stellar chemistry. For the metal-poor halo, PLATO is likely to detect between 1 and 80 planets with periods between 10 and 50 days, depending on the potential existence of a metallicity threshold for planet formation. The PLATO fields contain more than 3,400 potential target stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.6, which will help to improve our understanding of planets around metal-poor stars. We identify a specific target list of 47 (kinematically classified) halo stars in the high-priority, high-SNR PLATO P1 sample, offering prime opportunities in the search for planets in metal-poor environments.</description>

      <title>Slow Rotation for the Super-Puff Planet Kepler-51d</title>

Abstract: Super-puffs are low-density planets of unknown origin and composition. If they form by accreting nebular gas through a circumplanetary disk, one might expect super-puffs to be spinning quickly. Here, we derive upper limits on the rotational oblateness of the super-puff Kepler-51d, based on precise transit observations with the NIRSpec instrument aboard the James Webb Space Telescope. The absence of detectable oblateness-related anomalies in the light curve leads to an upper limit of about $0.15$ on the planet's sky-projected oblateness. Assuming the sky-projected oblateness to be representative of the true oblateness, the rotation period of Kepler-51d is $\gtrsim 40$ hours, or equivalently, its rotation speed is $\lesssim 42\%$ of the breakup speed. Alternatively, if the apparently low density of Kepler-51d is due to an opaque planetary ring, the ring must be oriented within $30\deg$ of face-on and have an inner radius smaller than $1.2$ times the planet's radius. Separately, the lack of anomalies exceeding $0.01\%$ in the ingress and egress portions of the light curve places a constraint on the model of Wang &amp; Dai, in which the planet's apparently low density is due to a dusty outflowing atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Hic Sunt Dracones: Uncovering Dynamical Perturbers Within the Habitable Zone</title>

Abstract: The continuing exploration of neighboring planetary systems is providing deeper insights into the relative prevalence of various system architectures, particularly with respect to the solar system. However, a full assessment of the dynamical feasibility of possible terrestrial planets within the Habitable Zones (HZ) of nearby stars requires detailed knowledge of the masses and orbital solutions of any known planets within these systems. Moreover, the presence of as yet undetected planets in or near the HZ will be crucial for providing a robust target list for future direct imaging surveys. In this work, we quantify the distribution of uncertainties on planetary masses and semi-major axes for 1062 confirmed planets, finding median uncertainties of 11.1% and 2.2%, respectively. We show the dependence of these uncertainties on stellar mass and orbital period, and discuss the effects of these uncertainties on dynamical analyses and the locations of mean motion resonance. We also calculate the expected radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude for a Neptune-mass planet in the middle of the HZ for each of the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory target stars. We find that for more than half of these stars, the RV semi-amplitude is less than 1.5 m/s, rendering them unlikely to be detected in archival RV data sets and highlighting the need for further observations to understand the dynamical viability of the HZ for these systems. We provide specific recommendations regarding stellar characterization and RV survey strategies that work toward the detection of presently unseen perturbers within the HZ.</description>

      <title>No evidence for a metallicity-dependent enhancement of distant giant companions to close-in small planets in the California Legacy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between close-in small planets (CS) and distant giants (DG) is central to understanding the formation of planetary systems like our own. Most studies of this connection have found evidence for a positive correlation, though significant statistical and systematic uncertainties remain due to differences in sample size, target selection bias, and even the definitions of `close-in small' and `distant giant' planets. Recently, Bryan &amp; Lee (2024) conducted a study of 184 stars hosting super-Earths ($M \sin i = 1-20 \, M_{E}$ or $R = 1-4 \, R_{E}$) to determine the effect of stellar metallicity on the prevalence of distant giant companions ($M \sin i = 0.5-20 \, M_{Jup}$, $a = 1-10$ AU). They found that such giants are twice as common in the presence of inner planets, but \textit{only} in metal-rich systems: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]&gt;0) = $28^{+4.9}_{-4.6}\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]&gt;0) = $14.3 ^{+2.0}_{-1.8}\%$. Further, they found that this correlation disappears for metal-poor stars: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]$\leq$0) = $4.5^{+2.6}_{-1.9}\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]$\leq$0) = $5.0^{+1.6}_{-1.3}\%$. We conducted an analogous study to test whether this effect was present in the California Legacy Survey sample. Using the same planet definitions, we did not find evidence for an enhancement in metal-rich systems: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]&gt;0) = $14^{+12}_{-8}\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]&gt;0) = $16.4^{+2.5}_{-2.4}\%$. We also found a $2\sigma$ tension between our conditional rate and a 2x enhancement. The discrepancy between our findings and theirs may arise from a variety of sources, underscoring the need for large exoplanet surveys to overcome both small number statistics and sample inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Evolution of Hot Exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations have shown that the strength of planetary magnetic fields depends on the convective energy flux emerging from planetary interiors. Here we model the interior structure of gas giant planets using \texttt{MESA}, to determine the convective energy flux that can drive the generation of magnetic field. This flux is then incorporated in the Christensen et al. dynamo formalism to estimate the maximum dipolar magnetic field $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$ of our simulated planets. First, we explore how the surface field of intensely irradiated hot Jupiters ($\sim 300 M_\oplus$) and hot Neptunes ($\sim 20 M_\oplus$) evolve as they age. Assuming an orbital separation of 0.1 au, for the hot Jupiters, we find that $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$ evolves from 240 G at 500 Myr to 120 G at 5~Gyr. For hot Neptunes, the magnetic field evolves from 11 G at young ages and dies out at $\gtrsim$ 2 Gyr. Furthermore, we also investigate the effects of atmospheric mass fraction, atmospheric evaporation, orbital separations $\alpha$ and additional planetary masses on the derived $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$. We found that $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$ increases with $\alpha$ for very close-in planets and plateaus out after that. Higher atmospheric mass fractions lead in general to stronger surface fields, because they allow for more extensive dynamo regions and stronger convection.</description>

      <title>Examining the rotation of the planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 3942</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on radial velocities, EXORAP photometry, and activity indicators, the HADES team reported a 16.3-day rotation period for the M dwarf GJ 3942. However, an RV--H$\alpha$ magnitude-squared coherence estimate has significant peaks at frequencies 1/16 cycles/day and 1/32 cycles/day. We re-analyze HADES data plus Hipparcos, SuperWASP, and TESS photometry to see whether the rotation period could be 32 days with 16-day harmonic. SuperWASP shows no significant periodicities, while the Hipparcos observing cadence is suboptimal for detecting 16- and 32-day periodicities. Although the average TESS periodogram has peaks at harmonics of 1/16 cycles/day, the harmonic sequence is not fully resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion. The TESS observations suggest a 1/16 cycles/day rotation frequency and a 1/32 cycles/day subharmonic, though resolution makes the TESS rotation detection ambiguous.</description>
