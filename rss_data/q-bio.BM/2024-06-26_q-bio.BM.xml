      <title>Efficiently Predicting Mutational Effect on Homologous Proteins by Evolution Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting protein properties is paramount for biological and medical advancements. Current protein engineering mutates on a typical protein, called the wild-type, to construct a family of homologous proteins and study their properties. Yet, existing methods easily neglect subtle mutations, failing to capture the effect on the protein properties. To this end, we propose EvolMPNN, Evolution-aware Message Passing Neural Network, an efficient model to learn evolution-aware protein embeddings. EvolMPNN samples sets of anchor proteins, computes evolutionary information by means of residues and employs a differentiable evolution-aware aggregation scheme over these sampled anchors. This way, EvolMPNN can efficiently utilise a novel message-passing method to capture the mutation effect on proteins with respect to the anchor proteins. Afterwards, the aggregated evolution-aware embeddings are integrated with sequence embeddings to generate final comprehensive protein embeddings. Our model shows up to 6.4% better than state-of-the-art methods and attains 36X inference speedup in comparison with large pre-trained models. Code and models are available at https://github.com/zhiqiangzhongddu/EvolMPNN.</description>

      <title>Scoreformer: A Surrogate Model For Large-Scale Prediction of Docking Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present ScoreFormer, a novel graph transformer model designed to accurately predict molecular docking scores, thereby optimizing high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) in drug discovery. The architecture integrates Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Learnable Random Walk Positional Encodings (LRWPE), enhancing the model's ability to understand complex molecular structures and their relationship with their respective docking scores. This approach significantly surpasses traditional HTVS methods and recent Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in both recovery and efficiency due to a wider coverage of the chemical space and enhanced performance. Our results demonstrate that ScoreFormer achieves competitive performance in docking score prediction and offers a substantial 1.65-fold reduction in inference time compared to existing models. We evaluated ScoreFormer across multiple datasets under various conditions, confirming its robustness and reliability in identifying potential drug candidates rapidly.</description>
