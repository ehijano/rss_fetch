      <title>Physics-based linear regression for high-dimensional forward uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce linear regression using physics-based basis functions optimized through the geometry of an inner product space. This method addresses the challenge of surrogate modeling with high-dimensional input, as the physics-based basis functions encode problem-specific information. We demonstrate the method using a proof-of-concept nonlinear random vibration example.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Flux Limiters</title>

Abstract: The stable numerical integration of shocks in compressible flow simulations relies on the reduction or elimination of Gibbs phenomena (unstable, spurious oscillations). A popular method to virtually eliminate Gibbs oscillations caused by numerical discretization in under-resolved simulations is to use a flux limiter. A wide range of flux limiters has been studied in the literature, with recent interest in their optimization via machine learning methods trained on high-resolution datasets. The common use of flux limiters in numerical codes as plug-and-play blackbox components makes them key targets for design improvement. Moreover, while aleatoric (inherent randomness) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainty is commonplace in fluid dynamical systems, these effects are generally ignored in the design of flux limiters. Even for deterministic dynamical models, numerical uncertainty is introduced via coarse-graining required by insufficient computational power to solve all scales of motion. Here, we introduce a conceptually distinct type of flux limiter that is designed to handle the effects of randomness in the model and uncertainty in model parameters. This new, {\it probabilistic flux limiter}, learned with high-resolution data, consists of a set of flux limiting functions with associated probabilities, which define the frequencies of selection for their use. Using the example of Burgers' equation, we show that a machine learned, probabilistic flux limiter may be used in a shock capturing code to more accurately capture shock profiles. In particular, we show that our probabilistic flux limiter outperforms standard limiters, and can be successively improved upon (up to a point) by expanding the set of probabilistically chosen flux limiting functions.</description>

      <title>Importance of hyper-parameter optimization during training of physics-informed deep learning networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating scientific knowledge into deep learning (DL) models for materials-based simulations can constrain the network's predictions to be within the boundaries of the material system. Altering loss functions or adding physics-based regularization (PBR) terms to reflect material properties informs a network about the physical constraints the simulation should obey. The training and tuning process of a DL network greatly affects the quality of the model, but how this process differs when using physics-based loss functions or regularization terms is not commonly discussed. In this manuscript, several PBR methods are implemented to enforce stress equilibrium on a network predicting the stress fields of a high elastic contrast composite. Models with PBR enforced the equilibrium constraint more accurately than a model without PBR, and the stress equilibrium converged more quickly. More importantly it was observed that independently fine-tuning each implementation resulted in more accurate models. More specifically each loss formulation and dataset required different learning rates and loss weights for the best performance. This result has important implications on assessing the relative effectiveness of different DL models and highlights important considerations when making a comparison between DL methods.</description>
