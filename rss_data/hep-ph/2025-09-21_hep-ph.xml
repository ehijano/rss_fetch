      <title>Towards next-gen parton distribution and fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interest into parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs) in current high energy physics research is twofold. On the one hand, they are fundamental objects to conduct precision phenomenology studies, e.g. at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), to determine the Standard Model parameters and search for new physics. On the other hand, they are also a means to understand the inner structure and dynamics of hadrons, e.g. in regards to the proton spin decomposition at the future Electron Ion Collider (EIC). This thesis presents advancements in PDF and FF determinations contributing to upcoming releases by the NNPDF collaboration. For PDFs, three topics are addressed: (i) assessing the K-factor approximation versus exact NNLO calculations; (ii) evaluating the compatibility of new data with existing PDFs, accounting for all relevant theoretical and experimental uncertainties; and (iii) studying the impact of new data, with focus on processes sensitive to the gluon PDF: single-inclusive jet and di-jet production in proton-proton collisions and deep-inelastic scattering, and top-quark pair production in proton-proton collisions. For FFs, I extend the NNPDF framework through: (i) implementation of time-like evolution in EKO; (ii) extension of PineAPPL to handle multiple convolutions of PDFs and FFs, including the corresponding factorization scales and the polarization of the initial and final states; and (iii) development of a new code, vhf, for computing SIA and SIDIS cross sections. All of these developments are crucial to prepare the release of next-gen PDF and FF sets that will allow us to take advantage of the forthcoming LHC and EIC physics programs as much as possible.</description>

      <title>Higgs-like Resonances and Massive Neutrinos in a 3-3-1 Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental results have reported mild deviations from Standard Model predictions in processes involving two photons in the final state, suggesting the possible presence of high-mass scalar resonances at the few-hundred-GeV scale. We investigate these anomalies within the framework of 3-3-1 models, a well-motivated class of extensions of the Standard Model. Focusing on the most relevant regions of parameter space, we determine the preferred scalar mass ranges and present the results in terms of probability density functions. We implement the 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos, which can be considered as a benchmark within this class of models, in the SARAH package. The scalar sector is constructed from the most general potential involving three Higgs triplets and one scalar sextet, consistent with the required symmetries for a realistic model. The neutrino sector is also analyzed in some detail, where left- and right-handed neutrinos reside in the same leptonic multiplet. Neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I seesaw mechanism, and the Yukawa couplings were constrained employing the Casas-Ibarra parametrization. Finally, we discuss the constraints arising from flavor-changing neutral currents and electroweak precision data.</description>

      <title>Transition Form-Factor for $\eta_Q$ at NNLO in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ and with all-order $v^2$ resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss both relativistic and perturbative QCD corrections to the transition form-factor ${\cal F}_{\eta_Q}{(t_1,t_2)}$ for the process $\gamma^*(q_1) \gamma^*(q_2) \leftrightarrow \eta_Q(P)$ with dependencies on the normalised photon virtualities $t_1=q_1^2/m_Q^2$ and $t_2=q_2^2/m_Q^2$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass. We resum a class of relativistic corrections to all orders in the relativistic parameter $\langle v^2 \rangle_{\eta_Q}$. In addition, we include perturbative QCD corrections up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. This involves the computation of two-loop amplitudes with two off-shell photons. We explore three different phenomenological applications of our transition form-factors for the charmonium case. We first study the ratio $\vert {\cal F}_{\eta_c}{(t_1,0)} \vert/ \vert {\cal F}_{\eta_c}{(0,0)} \vert$ for the single space-like photon case and compare our results with the existing $\eta_c$ measurements from the BaBar collaboration. Secondly, we consider observables for the case of double space-like photons and discuss the impact of the different corrections. The NNLO corrections for this case are presented here for the first time in the literature. Finally, we revisit the decay width $\Gamma[\eta_c \rightarrow \gamma \gamma]$ and compare it with the existing PDG value.</description>

      <title>Analytic two-loop amplitudes for di-jet and $\gamma+$jet production mediated by a heavy-quark loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present analytical results for the two-loop QCD corrections to the production of two partons or a photon and a parton in hadronic collisions, mediated by loops of massive quarks. These amplitudes involve Feynman integrals defined on an elliptic curve. We compute them by generalizing our recent results for the production of two photons to include additional crossings of the corresponding master integrals, which we compute in terms of the same basis of independent iterated integrals. We discuss the analytical properties of the amplitudes, highlighting the cancellations of a large number of elliptic differential forms in their finite remainders. Finally, we elaborate on a strategy for their numerical evaluation based on generalized series expansions at singular points of the physical amplitude, through the introduction of suitable sets of variables that allow us to resolve all singularities.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian truncation and quantum simulation of strong-field QED beyond tree level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics in strong background fields provides an interesting class of problems for classical and quantum simulation. In this paper we formulate simulations of polarization (helicity) flip for a photon colliding with a high-intensity plane wave. Polarization flip is a one loop effect, which requires addressing new issues that do not arise in simulations of tree-level processes. Working in the momentum-space Fock basis, while convenient for the extraction of scattering amplitudes, requires tuning counterterms to cancel large cutoff effects. We compute analytic formulas for the counterterms at one loop. We then construct circuits for quantum simulations of the process, perform noiseless simulations on classical computers to assess discretization errors, and discuss resource estimates for future simulations on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Hadronic tensor molecule $B_c^{\ast +}B_c^{\ast -}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass and full decay width of the hadronic tensor molecule $\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{T}}=B_c^{\ast +}B_c^{\ast -}$ are examined in the framework of QCD sum rule method. To find the mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this state, we use the two-point sum rules. The result $(12.87 \pm 0.08)~\mathrm{ GeV}$ for $m$ indicates that $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ can easily decay to pairs of $J/\psi \Upsilon $, $\eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$, and $ B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ mesons. Kinematically permitted ways for $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ to transform to conventional mesons include also processes $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}} \to D^{(\ast)+}D^{(\ast )-}$, $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\ast)+}D_{s}^{(\ast)-}$ triggered by annihilation of $b\overline{b}$ quarks in the molecule. The decays to meson pairs $B^{(\ast)+}B^{(\ast )-}$, $B^{(\ast )0}\overline{B}^{(\ast )0}$ , and $B_{s}^{(\ast)0}\overline{B}_{s}^{(\ast )0}$ generated by $c\overline{c } \to $ light quarks are also among possible channels of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$. Technical tools of the three-point sum rule approach are applied to compute partial widths of these decays. Our results for the mass and width $\Gamma_{\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}}=(154 \pm 19)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ are important for experimental studies of fully heavy exotic structures.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of $f_0(980)$ via the signal $\pi\pi$ state in semileptonic $D_{s}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of light scalar mesons remains an unsolved puzzle in hadron physics, complicated by their large widths and controversial partonic structure. We propose to resolve this problem in a comprehensive study of isoscalar two-pion state ($[\pi\pi]_{\rm S}$), the signal channel of $f_0(980)$, through its light-cone distribution amplitudes ($2\pi$DAs). A key finding is that charge parity forces the twist-3 $2\pi$DAs to be asymmetric in the momentum fractions of the quark and antiquark. This property stands in stark contrast to the symmetric twist-3 distribution amplitudes of a conventional $f_0(980)$ meson, as derived from QCD sum rules in the narrow-width approximation. We calculate the $D_s \to [\pi\pi]_{\rm S}$ transition form factors and discover a significant cancellation between the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions. This leads to a QCD prediction for the $D_s^+ \to [\pi\pi]_{\rm S} e^+ \nu_e$ decay width that is significantly smaller than the experimental measurement. Our results indicate that the lowest Fock state is not the dominant configuration of the isoscalar two-pion state produced in charm decays, in contrast to the case in $B$ decays. Future precision measurements can constrain the high-twist $2\pi$DAs associated with multi-particle Fock states, offering a new path to elucidate the structure of the light scalar mesons.</description>

      <title>$\Xi_c(3055)$ as a scaling point to establish the excited $\Xi_c^{(\prime)}$ family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass spectra and decay properties of the low-lying orbital excited $\Xi_c^{(\prime)}$ baryons are investigated in the framework of the chiral quark model and quark pair creation mechanism, which are mainly based on the recently experimental fact that $\Xi_c(3055)$ is a $D$-wave state excited in $\lambda$-mode. As a result, we make an inference that, (i) $\Xi_{c}(2790)$ and $\Xi_{c}(2815)$ are likely to be $\lambda$-mode excited $\Xi_{c1}(\frac{1}{2}^{-},1P)$ and $\Xi_{c1}(\frac{3}{2}^{-},1P)$ states, respectively. (ii) $\Xi_{c}(2923)$ and $\Xi_{c}(2939)$ could correspond respectively to the $\Xi_{c1}^{\prime}({\frac{1}{2}^{-}},1P)$ and $\Xi_{c2}^{\prime}({\frac{5}{2}^{-}},1P)$ states, while $\Xi_{c}(2965)$ might be a $\rho$-mode excited $\Xi_{c0}(\frac{1}{2}^{1},1P)$ state, and $\Xi_{c}(2882)$ might be arranged as $\Xi_{c0}^{\prime}(\frac{1}{2}^{-},1P)$. (iii) $\Xi_{c}(2970)$ might be the $\Xi_{c}(\frac{1}{2}^{+},2S)$ state. (iv) $\Xi_{c}(3055)$ and $\Xi_{c}(3080)$ can form a $\lambda$-mode excited $D$-wave doublet $\Xi_{c2}(\frac{3}{2}^+,\frac{5}{2}^+)$.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark photon dark matter from terrestrial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel search for dark photon dark matter (DM) using terrestrial magnetic field measurements at frequencies below 100 Hz. Coherently oscillating dark photon DM can induce a monochromatic magnetic field via kinetic mixing with ordinary photons. Notably, for dark photon masses $m_{A'}$ around $3 \times 10^{-14}$ eV, the signal can be resonantly amplified within a cavity formed by the Earth's surface and the ionosphere. We compute the expected signal incorporating the effect of atmospheric conductivity, and derive new upper limits on the kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ from long-term geomagnetic data. These limits improve upon previous ground-based constraints in the mass range of $1 \times 10^{-15}$ eV $\lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-13}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Accessing nucleon transversity with one-point energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel probe of the nucleon's transversity distribution, $h_1^q$, using the one-point energy correlator (OPEC), an infrared-and-collinear safe jet substructure observable. We demonstrate that in transversely polarized $p^{\uparrow}p$ collisions, the OPEC exhibits a single-spin asymmetry (SSA) with a clean $\sin(\phi_s - \phi_n)$ angular dependence. This method probes SSA over a much wider kinematic range in the angular scale $\theta_n$ compared to traditional measurements of hadron transverse momentum~$j_\perp$, establishing a complementary and systematically distinct channel to study the nucleon's three-dimensional structure at RHIC and the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a topological susceptibility in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model implies the existence of a pseudoscalar state in the spectrum, $\eta_W$. We show that, within the Standard Model, no new particle is required to form this state. We identify the $\eta_W$ state with the CP-odd linear combination of the ground states of hydrogen and antihydrogen atoms.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Strings in $E_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the appearance of superconducting strings in $E_6$ grand unification, keeping track of the magnetic monopole flux that precedes the formation of the string flux tube. This flux matching ensures compatibility with the quantum tunneling of a monopole-antimonopole pair on a metastable string. We identify two realistic $E_6$ models with superconducting (metastable) strings that also carry zero modes of the right handed Majorana neutrinos and dark matter particles. Depending on the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable gravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Topologically stable superconducting strings also appear if the $E_6$ symmetry breaking leaves unbroken the $Z_2$ subgroup of $Z_4$, the center of $SO(10)$. The zero modes of the SM fermions are the charge carriers in this case. Finally, the flux matching condition ensures that the Aharanov-Bohm phase change in going around the metastable strings is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ for all fields. The fields in the spinorial representation of SO(10) acquire a phase change of $\exp(\pm i\pi)$ if taken around the topologically stable $Z_2$ string.</description>

Abstract: We report quantitative results on the single-mass heavy-flavor contributions up to
  three-loop order to the unpolarized structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ and the polarized
  structure function $g_1(x,Q^2)$ for the first time. These results are relevant for
  precision QCD analyses of the World deep-inelastic data and the data taken at future
  colliders, such as the Electron--Ion Collider, in order to measure the strong coupling
  constant $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$, and the twist-2 parton distribution functions consistently

      <title>Global Spin Alignment of (Anti-)$^4$Li in Non-Central Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-central heavy-ion collisions produce hot and dense nuclear matter with significant fluid vorticity, which can induce global polarizations or alignments of particles with non-zero spins along the direction of the total orbital angular momentum. This phenomenon has been observed for hyperons and vector mesons in experiments. In the present study, we demonstrate that polarized nucleons lead to global spin alignment of the unstable nucleus $^4$Li, which can be measured through its strong decays via $^4\text{Li} \rightarrow {^3\text{He}} + p$. Assuming that $^4$Li is formed through the coalescence of polarized nucleons at kinetic freeze-out, we obtain the angular distribution of the daughter particle $^3$He in the rest frame of the polarized $^4$Li. Taking kinetically freeze-out nucleons from an isotropic and thermalized fireball of constant vorticity and including quantum corrections up to $\hbar^2$ in the coalescence calculation through the Moyal star product, we find that the angular distribution of $^3$He has a $\cos(2\theta^*)$ dependence with $\theta^*$ being its angle with respect to the quantization axis of $^4$Li. We also find that the $^3$He angular distribution depends on both the vorticity and the polarization of kinetically freeze-out nucleons. Future measurements on the spin alignment of $^4$Li in heavy-ion collisions thus offer a promising method to probe the spin dynamics, vortical structure, and spin-dependent equation-of-state of the nuclear matter produced in these collisions.</description>

      <title>Cold and fuzzy dark sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Fuzzy Dark Sector (FDS) scenario as a rich, interacting system and candidate for dark matter. This serves as a natural extension of the single-component, non-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) paradigm. Concretely, we consider an ultra-light Abelian-Higgs model, with interacting Higgs and dark photon degrees of freedom. We find that the transfer function, and hence imprint on the CMB and Large-Scale Structure (LSS), is characterized by a single characteristic scale of the interacting fuzzy dark sector, allowing us to recover the LSS signature of single-field FDM, dependent on the FDS parameters. In contrast, galactic halos present a great diversity, unlike with the universality of single-field FDM, owing to the interaction between fields. This interaction introduces an instability that is not otherwise present for the case of four decoupled scalars. Finally, we comment on primordial production and portals to the Standard Model, and introduce another simple realization of the Fuzzy Dark Sector paradigm with a kinetic coupling.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of seasonal variations of the muon energy spectrum in air showers to hadronic interaction models and the cosmic-ray mass composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of muons produced in air showers depends not only on the properties of the primary particle, but also on the atmosphere. This is because of the competition between decay and interaction of the parent mesons, which depends on the atmospheric density. As a result, the number of muons at ground shows a seasonal variation, with the strength of the variation depending on the primary cosmic-ray energy, mass, as well as the energy of the detected muons. In this contribution, we study the variations of the muon energy spectrum in air showers using MCEq, a numerical solver of the cascade equations. In particular, we show how the amplitude of the seasonal variations of the number of high-energy (O(TeV)) muons in the shower depends on the primary energy, mass, as well as the assumed hadronic interaction model. A measurement of these variations is possible with the combination of a surface air-shower array and a deep underground detector, which provide a simultaneous measurement of the primary energy and the high-energy muon multiplicity, and may provide a new way to probe the cosmic-ray mass composition and hadronic interactions.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Muon and Pion Cooling on the Neutrino Spectrum of NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected a flux of $\sim 1-10 \, {\rm TeV}$ neutrinos from the active galaxy, NGC 1068. The soft spectral index of these neutrinos has previously been interpreted as an indication that this source accelerates protons only up to energies of several hundred TeV. Here, we propose that this source might instead accelerate protons to significantly higher energies, but that the charged pions and muons produced in their interactions undergo significant synchrotron energy losses before they can decay, leading to a cutoff in the neutrino spectrum at TeV-scale energies. This scenario would require very strong magnetic fields to be present in the acceleration region of NGC 1068, on the order of $B \sim 10^7 \, {\rm G}$. We point out that this synchrotron cooling would impact the flavor ratios of the neutrinos from this source, providing a means to test this scenario with future very-large volume neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Compressibility and speed of sound in magnetized nuclear matter with broken scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamical properties of magnetized nuclear matter at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential are studied within an effective model incorporating the QCD trace anomaly effect. The presence of magnetic field induces anisotropic structure in the energy momentum tensor due to the broken rotational invariance. The study exhibits a phase transition through the sudden change of the effective nucleon mass in a certain range of baryon chemical potential and temperature. The addition of nucleonic vacuum contribution at finite magnetic field leads to the magnetic catalysis effect. The change in squared speed of sound with chemical potential at various temperatures is closely connected to the nature of phase transition in nuclear matter. The pressure anisotropy results in different values of sound speed and isothermal compressibility in the parallel and perpendicular directions with respect to the magnetic field. The smaller values of isothermal compressibility in the parallel direction compared to the perpendicular one indicate that the equation of state is stiffer along the magnetic field direction. The studies of these thermodynamic observables can have significant importance in analyzing the properties of some compact astrophysical objects as well as in the context of non-central heavy ion collision experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.</description>

      <title>A Unified Neural-Network Framework for Nucleon Imaging from Numerical Simulations of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distributions encode the momentum-space structure and, in their generalizations, the spatial tomography of quarks and gluons inside hadrons, the building blocks of visible matter. We present a unified neural-network approach that learns these distributions directly from matrix elements calculated via numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on the lattice by fitting two complementary inputs simultaneously: data matched to physical quantities via known momentum-space and coordinate-space formalisms. Utilizing data from both methods stabilizes the extraction and mitigates biases that can arise when either is used alone. We validate the method on controlled mock data and apply it to lattice-QCD matrix elements to extract parton distribution functions (PDFs). We show benefits of such an approach for determining the physical quantities. We further extend the framework to zero-skewness generalized parton distributions and demonstrate nucleon tomography within the same neural-network parameterization. Our results provide an adaptable and systematically improvable approach for extracting partonic distributions from Euclidean correlators. It can incorporate polarization, additional channels, and future experimental constraints from current and future facilities, such as the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We offer a simple explanation for the small number of black holes observed in pairs with massive stars. In detached massive binaries, spherically symmetric accretion takes place. This accretion could result in effective energy release in the hard band only if the equipartition of the gravitational and magnetic energy of plasma is established (Shvartsmans theorem). However, we show that due to the magnetic exhaust effect this equilibrium is virtually never established for the actual magnetic fields observed on massive stars: Shvartsmans theorem does not work. As a result, it is virtually impossible to detect black holes in detached massive binaries by currently available means (mainly, through X-ray observations).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We further scrutinize the evidence for a recently suggested pseudo-scalar particle, the electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson. Its existence is demanded by matching the removal of the weak vacuum angle $\theta_{\rm w}$ by the anomalous $B+L$ - symmetry with a massive pole in the topological susceptibility of the vacuum. We specifically focus on the possibility of the emergence of $\eta_{\rm w}$ as a collective excitation of the phase of the condensate of the 't Hooft fermion determinant, generated by the electroweak instantons, which breaks the $B+L$ - symmetry spontaneously. We argue that the generation of the 't Hooft vertex is in one-to-one correspondence with its non-zero vacuum expectation value which is cutoff insensitive. We outline certain puzzles about the nature of the emergent $\eta_{\rm w}$ which require further investigations.</description>

      <title>Analytic derivation of GW spectrum from bubble collisions in FLRW Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum from bubble collisions during a cosmological first-order phase transition, under the thin-wall and envelope approximations, by incorporating the effect of cosmic expansion in the FLRW metric. Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the flat-spacetime limit. The latter expansion reveals that the flat-spacetime approximation breaks down for $\beta / H_* \lesssim 10$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion. Furthermore, the next-to-leading-order term contributes about a $10\%$ correction for $\beta / H_* \sim 140$, a typical value for the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was shown that pair luminosity of the newborn strange star with temperature of $10^{11}$ K may be as high as $L_\pm\simeq 10^{52}$ erg/s. The question remains: can a strange star maintain such a high surface temperature for a long time? To answer this question we studied thermal evolution of newborn strange star taking into account thermal conductivity of free quarks and neutrino emission by the URCA process. Our results show that extremely high luminosity due to the Schwinger process and insufficient thermal conductivity of quarks leads to development of steep temperature gradient at the surface of strange star. As a result, the temperature at the surface and hence its luminosity decreases as a power law, reaching $10^{40}$ erg/s already at 10 ms. This result holds even in the presence of neutrinosphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the D-measure of event-by-event net-electric charge fluctuations, an idea first introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signature for the presence of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions. We developed a quantitative framework that incorporates resonance-decay effects, global and local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. Folding these effects into a formalism of density correlations yields an improved expression for the $D$-measure inside acceptance. We make comparisons with ALICE data for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$~TeV. We find that a hadron-gas scenario can describe the data only for a very short charge conservation range, while a QGP scenario is in good agreement with the measurement and is relatively insensitive to the charge conservation range. A Bayesian comparison of both scenarios shows moderate evidence for freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic Footprints of Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel cosmographic framework to trace the late-time kinematics of the Universe without assuming any underlying dynamics. The method relies on generalized Pad\'e-$(2,1)$ expansions around arbitrary pivot redshifts, which, compared to state-of-the-art calculations, reduce truncation errors by up to two orders of magnitude at high redshift and yield more precise constraints by defining cosmographic parameters exactly where the data lie. This avoids extrapolations, mitigates degeneracies, and enables a clean disentangling of their effects. Using the latest low-redshift datasets, we center the generalized expansion in multiple bins across $z\in[0,1]$ and obtain precise constraints on the redshift evolution of cosmographic parameters. We find that all key parameters deviate from their $\Lambda$CDM predictions in a redshift-dependent way that can be naturally explained within dynamical Dark Energy scenarios. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ follows a redshift evolution consistent with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, while the generalized $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows deviations of up to $\sim4\sigma$ from the constant $\Lambda$CDM expectation, closely matching the CPL predictions. Taken together, these results point to footprints of dynamical Dark Energy in the kinematics of the Universe at $z\lesssim 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through a holographic model of QCD, we present a phenomenological approach to study the running of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ in both non-perturbative and perturbative regimes. The renormalization of the metric tensor, driven by the Ricci Flow, and the breaking of conformal and chiral symmetries -- thanks to introducing a double dilaton model and large-$N_c$ corrections -- allow us to relate the existence of an infrared fixed point in the coupling constant with a smooth matching to pQCD well above 2 GeV. This is done through a model with two fit parameters and one matching point. The proposed dilaton model yields linear Regge trajectories and decay constants for scalar, vector, and tensor meson families similar to their experimental counterparts.</description>

Abstract: A new dark matter candidate is proposed that arises as the lightest baryon from a confining $SU(N)$ gauge theory which equilibrates with the Standard Model only through electroweak interactions. Surprisingly, this candidate can be as light as a few GeV. The lower bound arises from the intersection of two competing requirements: i) the equilibration sector of the model must be sufficiently heavy, at least several TeV, to avoid bounds from colliders, and ii) the lightest dark meson (that may be the dark $\eta'$, $\sigma$, or the lightest glueball) has suppressed interactions with the SM, and must decay before BBN. The low energy dark sector consists of one flavor that is electrically neutral and an almost electroweak singlet. The dark matter candidate is the lightest baryon consisting of $N$ of these light flavors leading to a highly suppressed elastic scattering rate with the SM. The equilibration sector consists of vector-like dark quarks that transform under the electroweak group, ensuring that the dark sector can reach thermal equilibrium with the SM in the early Universe. The lightest dark meson lifetimes vary between $10^{-3} \lesssim c \tau \lesssim 10^7$~meters, providing an outstanding target for LHC production and experimental detection. We delineate the interplay between the lifetime of the light mesons, the suppressed direct detection cross section of the lightest baryon, and the scale of equilibration sector that can be probed at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Self-interaction effects on the Kerr black hole superradiance and their observational implications</title>

Abstract: Through the black hole (BH) superradiance, ultralight bosons can form dense clouds around rotating Kerr BHs. Certain ultralight bosons, such as axions and axion-like particles (promising dark matter candidates), naturally possess self-interactions, and thus may significantly modify the dynamics of the superradiance process. Previous studies on the detection or constraint of ultralight bosons through superradiance have usually neglected the self-interaction effects of bosons. In this work, we investigate the formation and evolution of self-interacting boson clouds in the full Kerr spacetime during BH superradiance. Using numerical methods, we compute the superradiant growth rate of boson clouds with self-interactions around Kerr BHs and quantitatively evaluate how the self-interaction strength of scalar bosons affects the growth rate. We also assess the evolution of the BH's mass and spin. Our results reveal that, in addition to the superradiance-imposed upper bound on the boson cloud mass, self-interaction of ultralight bosons introduces a new, lower critical mass limit, beyond which the growth rate of the boson cloud approaches zero. This implies that the superradiance process terminates earlier when self-interaction is considered. Furthermore, we explore how self-interaction affects both the oscillation frequency of boson clouds in gravitational atoms and the frequency of gravitational wave (GW) emitted through cloud annihilation. The anticipated frequency shift might be detectable by the GW observatories. Given that self-interaction substantially alters the evolution of BH superradiance, its effects can significantly relax existing constraints on scalar bosons derived from superradiance. Taking the spin measurements from GW190412 and GW190517 as examples, we discuss the impact of self-interaction on constraint results in details.</description>

Abstract: The presence of a dark matter component in the Universe, together with the discovery of neutrino masses from the observation of the oscillation phenomenon, represents one of the most important open questions in particle physics today. A concurrent solution arises when one of the right-handed neutrinos, necessary for the generation of light neutrino masses, is itself the dark matter candidate. In this article, we study the generation of such a dark matter candidate relying solely on the presence of neutrino mixing. This tightly links the generation of dark matter with searches in laboratory experiments on top of the usual indirect dark matter probes. We find that the regions of parameter space producing the observed dark matter abundance can be probed indirectly with electroweak precision observables and charged lepton flavor violation searches. Given that the heavy neutrino masses need to lie at most around the TeV scale, probes at future colliders would further test this production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Neutrino properties from muonium-antimuonium mixing</title>

Abstract: The nature of neutrino mass -- whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles -- remains one of the central open questions in particle physics. While observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would confirm the Majorana case, the absence of a signal offers no definitive insight. In light of this, we investigate muonium-antimuonium mixing -- proposed for further study at the MACE experiment -- as an alternative probe of neutrino properties. We compute the mixing amplitude in the Standard Model minimally extended to include massive Dirac or Majorana neutrinos, and correct previous calculations by properly treating the relevant infrared scales. As the GIM mechanism strongly suppresses the Dirac contribution, we explore whether relaxing unitarity of the PMNS matrix can enhance the mixing without obscuring neutrino properties. Surprisingly, the answer to this question is negative. We also examine the pseudo-Dirac case -- predominantly Dirac neutrinos with small Majorana masses -- and find that this scenario can significantly enhance the mixing compared to the pure Dirac case, especially for normal mass ordering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-quark--two-antiquark systems with four different quark flavors are considered in the framework of two-dimensional QCD, in the light-cone gauge, at leading orders of the $1/N_c^{}$ expansion. Introducing basis functions with color-singlet mesonic clusters, integral equations are established for the Green's functions and the related scattering amplitudes involved in the sectors of the direct and quark-exchange channels. The problem of infrared divergences is dealt with via a systematic use of an infrared regulator cutoff introduced in the gluon propagator. It is shown that the on-mass shell scattering amplitudes are free of infrared divergences up to order $1/N_c^2$. In the limit of vanishing of the infrared cutoff, they can be represented by effective four-meson contact-type interaction terms with unitarity loops, calculable in terms of the meson wave functions and propagators. The results, obtained at order $1/N_c^2$, are summed with the constraint of unitarization. The unitarized scattering amplitudes are continued in the total mass-squared variable below the two-meson thresholds, leading to a tetraquark bound state equation, which generally has one solution. Spectroscopic applications of the above results are sketched and discussed.</description>

Abstract: We systematically investigate the possible phenomenological impact of residual flavour groups in the charged lepton sector. We consider all possible flavour charge assignments for abelian residual symmetries up to Z8. The allowed flavour structures of operators in Standard Model Effective Field Theory (up to dimension six) lead to distinctive and observable patterns of charged lepton flavour violating processes. We illustrate the relevance of such selection rules displaying the current bounds on and the future sensitivities to the new physics scale. These results demonstrate, in particular, the importance and discriminating power of searches for lepton flavour violating tau lepton decays and muonium to antimuonium conversion.</description>

      <title>Deep-Inelastic Scattering at TeV Energies with LHC Muons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHC far-forward experiments FASER and SND@LHC have pioneered the detection of TeV-energy neutrinos produced in hard-scattering proton-proton collisions at the LHC. In addition to neutrinos, an intense flux of TeV-energy muons reaches these detectors, representing a dominant background for both neutrino studies and beyond the Standard Model searches. Here we demonstrate that this forward muon flux enables a comprehensive neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) program at FASER with a strong kinematical overlap with the Electron Ion Collider. For the Run 3 luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm pp}=250$~fb$^{-1}$, more than $10^5$ inclusive muon DIS events, of which up to $10^4$ from charm production, are expected at FASER$\nu$. As a representative application, we demonstrate the sensitivity of muon DIS at FASER$\nu$ to probe the (intrinsic) charm content of the proton at large-$x$. We also provide predictions for event yields of muon DIS for future FASER runs and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of $T^*_{cs0}(2870)^0$, $T^*_{c\bar s 0}(2900)^0$ and $T^*_{c\bar s 0}(2900)^{++}$ open-charmed tetraquark states by LHCb, we study the decays of heavy mesons to these open-charmed tetraquark states ($T$) using a topological amplitude approach. We first obtain the $T\to DP$ and $DS$ strong decay amplitudes by decomposing them into several topological amplitudes, where $P$ is a light pseudo-scalar particle and $S$ is a low-lying scalar particle. Subsequently, weak decay amplitudes of $\overline B\to D\overline T$, $\overline D T$ and $\overline B\to TP$, $TS$ decays are decomposed topologically. In addition, $B^-_c\to T\overline T$ decays are also discussed. Using these results, modes with an unambiguous exotic interpretation in flavor are highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP) we calculate the effective Hamiltonians in the theory of a fermion field coupled to a scalar field via the Yukawa interaction. The theory is renormalized by the addition of counterterms. Necessary counterterms are determined by computing matrix elements of the effective Hamiltonian. All calculations are performed up to the second order in the expansion in powers of the coupling constant. Renormalized effective Hamiltonians are well-defined symmetric forms acting in the Fock space as opposed to the renormalized bare Hamiltonian, which is not well-defined without regularization. We introduce computational techniques that should streamline higher-order calculations and may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We perform systematical investigations of heavy flavor tetraquark systems, including fully heavy $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ ($Q=b,c$), doubly heavy $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar q\bar q$ ($q=u,d$), and singly heavy $Qs\bar q\bar q$ tetraquark systems, within the framework of quark potential model. We employ the Gaussian expansion method and complex scaling method to solve the four-body Hamiltonian and identify bound and resonant states. We further calculate the root mean square radii to study the spatial configurations of tetraquarks. Our calculations reveal a rich spectrum of tetraquark states exhibiting diverse spatial configurations. In particular, we find good candidates for experimental states $X(6900)$, $X(7200)$, $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, and $T_{\bar c\bar s0}^*(2870)$. The fully charmed tetraquark resonances $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$ are compact teraquark states, while doubly charmed tetraquark bound state $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and charm-strange tetraquark resonance $T_{\bar c\bar s0}^*(2870)$ are meson molecules. Additionally, more tetraquark bound and resonant states are predicted and may be searched for in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological reheating bridges the inflationary epoch and the hot big bang phase, yet its underlying dynamics remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate a minimal scenario in which the inflaton evolves under a simple power-law potential during reheating and interacts with other particles via renormalizable couplings. We show that inflaton quanta can be regenerated from the thermal bath even after the decay of the coherent inflaton field, unveiling a previously overlooked channel for inflaton particle production, which offers a novel window into probing reheating. Remarkably, this mechanism may also account for the observed dark matter abundance, providing a natural link between early Universe dynamics and present-day cosmological observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a holographic prescription for the Schwinger-Keldysh closed time path, we derive the effective action for a dissipative neutral fluid holographically described by the Einstein gravity in an asymptotic AdS spacetime. In the saddle point approximation for the dual gravity, the goal is achieved by solving the double Dirichlet problem for the linearized gravitational field living in a complexified static AdS black brane background. We adopt a partially on-shell scheme for solving the bulk dynamics, which is equivalent to ``integrating out'' the gapped modes in the boundary field theory. The boundary effective action in the fluid spacetime, identified as the partially on-shell bulk action, is computed to first order in boundary derivative and to cubic order in AdS boundary data. The boundary effective action, rewritten in the physical spacetime, successfully reproduces various results known in the framework of classical hydrodynamics, confirming our holographic derivation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work Phys. Rev. D 107, 074507 (2023), we showed that form factors for radiative leptonic decays of pseudoscalar mesons can be determined efficiently and with high precision from lattice QCD using the ``3d method,'' in which three-point functions are computed for all values of the current-insertion time and the time integral is performed at the data-analysis stage. Here, we demonstrate another benefit of the 3d method: the form factors can be extracted for any number of nonzero photon virtualites from the same three-point functions at no extra cost. We present results for the $D_s\to\ell\nu\gamma^*$ vector form factor as a function of photon energy and photon virtuality, for both positive and negative virtuality. In our analysis, we separately consider the two different time orderings and the different quark flavors in the electromagnetic current. We discuss in detail the behavior of the unwanted exponentials contributing to the three-point functions, as well as the choice of fit models and fit ranges used to remove them for various values of the virtuality. While positive photon virtuality is relevant for decays to multiple charged leptons, negative photon virtuality suppresses soft contributions and is of interest in QCD-factorization studies of the form factors.</description>

      <title>From top quarks to enhanced quantum key distribution: A Framework for Optimal Predictability of Quantum Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of quantum measurements is a cornerstone of quantum information theory and a key resource for quantum technologies. Here, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying the predictability of measurements on a bipartite quantum system using error measures inherited from statistical learning theory: the Bayes risk and inference variance. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal measurement that minimizes the prediction error for any arbitrary observable and any two-qubit state. We establish a direct, quantitative link between the ability to surpass the fundamental limit of local unpredictability and the presence of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Additionally, by optimizing measurement choices according to the minimal Bayes risk, we propose a modified entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol achieving higher secure key rates than the standard BB84 protocol, demonstrating enhanced resilience to noise. We apply our framework in two scenarios: perfect Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and top-antitop quark pairs produced in high-energy colliders. Our work offers a novel perspective on quantum correlations, connecting statistical inference, fundamental quantum phenomena, and cryptographic applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a numerical treatment of the annual modulation of relic neutrinos due to the Sun's gravitational influence. Extending our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework from Milky Way scales to solar system dynamics, we model how cosmic neutrino background densities might vary throughout Earth's orbital cycle. We validate our numerical approach against analytical expectations from previous studies that assumed idealized relic neutrino populations. Our results suggest that the prior gravitational history of neutrinos traversing asymmetric dark matter distributions can affect annual modulation patterns. While our simulations reproduce modulation amplitudes similar to analytical predictions for heavier neutrinos, we find that the amplitude can vary considerably depending on the specific morphology of dark matter halos. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating realistic structure formation effects when predicting potential observational relic neutrino signatures.</description>

Analyses of these simulations critically depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time. In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations. These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.</description>

      <title>Smooth binary evolution from wide resonances in boson clouds</title>

Abstract: Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes. These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>Angular correlations in neutron-gamma reactions</title>

Abstract: Angular correlations for low-energy neutron induced $\gamma$ reactions are calculated using nuclear reaction formalism for multi level neutron capture with arbitrary multiplicities of $\gamma$ transitions. We confirm previous calculations [V. V. Flambaum and O. P. Sushkov, Nucl. Phys.A 435 , 352 (1985)] for dipole transitions obtained with different formalism. The possible applications of n-$\gamma$ correlations for studies of symmetry violations and electromagnetic transitions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Feynman-like parameterizations of (anti-)de Sitter Witten diagrams for all masses at any loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02699</link>

Abstract: Computing correlation functions in curved spacetime is central to both theoretical and experimental efforts, from precision cosmology to quantum simulations of strongly coupled systems. In anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) space, the key observables, boundary correlators in AdS and late-time correlators in dS, are obtained via Witten diagram calculations. While formally analogous to flat-space Feynman diagrams, even tree-level Witten diagrams are significantly more complicated due to the structure of bulk propagators. Existing computational approaches often focus on scalars with a specific "conformal" mass, for which propagators simplify enough to permit the use of standard flat-space techniques. This restriction, however, omits the generic internal-line masses that arise in many cosmological and holographic settings. We present the Witten-Feynman (WF) parameterization, a general representation of scalar Witten diagrams in (A)dS as generalized Euler integrals. The WF framework applies in both position and momentum space, accommodates arbitrary internal and external masses, and holds at any loop order. It directly generalizes the familiar Feynman parameterization form of Feynman integrals, making it possible to import a broad range of amplitude techniques into the curved-space setting. We illustrate the method through two applications: a generalization of Weinberg's theorem on ultraviolet convergence and a series expansion technique that can yield explicit evaluations. Our results provide a unified computational tool for (A)dS boundary correlators, opening the door to more systematic calculations relevant for upcoming experiments and simulations.</description>
