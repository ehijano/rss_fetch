      <title>Symmetric Separation of Variables for the Extended Clebsch and Manakov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, using a modification of the method of vector fields $Z_i$ of the bi-Hamiltonian theory of separation of variables (SoV), we construct symmetric non-St\"ackel variable separation for three-dimensional extension of the Clebsch model, which is equivalent (in the bi-Hamiltonian sense) to the system of interacting Manakov (Schottky-Frahm) and Euler tops. For the obtained symmetric SoV (contrary to the previously constructed asymmetric one), all curves of separation are the same and have genus five. It occurred that the difference between the symmetric and asymmetric cases is encoded in the different form of the vector fields $Z$ used to construct separating polynomial. We explicitly construct coordinates and momenta of separation and Abel-type equations in the considered examples of symmetric SoV for the extended Clebsch and Manakov models.</description>

      <title>Existence of Liouvillan solutions in the Hess-Sretensky case of the problem of motion of a gyrostat with a fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1890 W. Hess found the new special case of integrability of the Euler - Poisson equations of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point. In 1963 L.N. Sretensky proved that the special case of integrability, similar to the Hess case, also exists in the problem of the motion of a heavy gyrostat - a heavy rigid body with a fixed point, which contains a rotating homogeneous rotor. Further numerous generalizations of the classical Hess case were proposed, which take place during the motion of a heavy rigid body and a gyrostat with a fixed point in various force fields.
  The first studies that provided a qualitative description of the motion of a heavy rigid body in the integrable Hess case were published almost immediately after this case was found. In 1892 P.A. Nekrasov proved, that the solution of the problem of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point in the Hess case is reduced to the integration the second order linear homogeneous differential equation with variable coefficients. A similar result regarding the problem of the motion of a heavy gyrostat in the Hess - Sretensky case was presented by Sretensky.
  In this paper we present the derivation of the corresponding second order linear differential equation and reduce the coefficients of this equation to the form of rational functions. Then, using the Kovacic algorithm we study the problem of the existence of liouvillian solutions of the corresponding second order linear differential equation. We obtain the conditions for the parameters of the problem, under which the liouvillian solutions of the corresponding linear differential equation exist. Under these conditions equations of motion of a heavy gyrostat with a fixed point in the Hess - Sretensky case can be integrated in quadratures.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal massive Thirring model and its solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlocal version of the massive Thirring model (MTM) and its solutions are presented. We start from a 4-component system that can be reduced to the classical MTM and nonlocal MTM. Bilinear form of the 4-component system and general double Wronskian solutions are derived. By utilizing reduction technique we obtain solutions of the nonlocal MTM. Relations between the nonlocal MTM and the nonlocal Fokas-Lenells equation is discussed. Some solutions of the nonlocal MTM, such as solitons, double-pole solution, algebraic solitons and high order algebraic solitons are analyzed and illustrated.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Focus Issue: Topics in Nonlinear Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear science has evolved significantly over the 35 years since the launch of the journal Chaos. This Focus Issue, dedicated to the 80th Birthday of its founding editor-in-chief, David K. Campbell, brings together a selection of contributions on influential topics, many of which were advanced by Campbell's own research program and leadership role. The topics include new phenomena and method development in the realms of network dynamics, machine learning, quantum and material systems, chaos and fractals, localized states, and living systems, with a good balance of literature review, original contributions, and perspectives for future research.</description>

      <title>Planar networks and simple Lie groups beyond type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The general linear group $GL_{n}$, along with its adjoint simple group $PGL_n$, can be described by means of weighted planar networks. In this paper we give a network description for simple Lie groups of types $B$ and $C$. The corresponding networks are axially symmetric modulo a sequence of cluster mutations along the axis of symmetry. We extend to this setting the result of Gekhtman, Shapiro, and Vainshtein on the Poisson property of Postnikov's boundary measurement map. We also show that $B$ and $C$ type networks with positive weights parametrize the totally nonnegative part of the respective group. Finally, we construct network parametrizations of double Bruhat cells in symplectic and odd-dimensional orthogonal groups, and identify the corresponding face weights with Fock-Goncharov cluster coordinates.</description>

      <title>Modulational Instability of Small Amplitude Periodic Traveling Waves in the Novikov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral stability of smooth, small-amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions of the Novikov equation, which is a Camassa-Holm type equation with cubic nonlinearities. Specifically, we investigate the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-spectrum of the associated linearized operator, which in this case is an integro-differential operator with periodic coefficients, in a neighborhood of the origin in the spectral plane. Our analysis shows that such small-amplitude periodic solutions are spectrally unstable to long-wavelength perturbations if the wave number if greater than a critical value, bearing out the famous Benmajin-Feir instability for the Novikov equation. On the other hand, such waves with wave number less than the critical value are shown to be spectrally stable. Our methods are based on applying spectral perturbation theory to the associated linearization.</description>
