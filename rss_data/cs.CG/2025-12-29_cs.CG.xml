      <title>Graph Drawing Stress Model with Resistance Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper challenges the convention of using graph-theoretic shortest distance in stress-based graph drawing. We propose a new paradigm based on resistance distance, derived from the graph Laplacian's spectrum, which better captures global graph structure. This approach overcomes theoretical and computational limitations of traditional methods, as resistance distance admits a natural isometric embedding in Euclidean space. Our experiments demonstrate improved neighborhood preservation and cluster faithfulness. We introduce Omega, a linear-time graph drawing algorithm that integrates a fast resistance distance embedding with random node-pair sampling for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This comprehensive random sampling strategy, enabled by efficient pre-computation of resistance distance embeddings, is more effective and robust than pivot-based sampling used in prior algorithms, consistently achieving lower and more stable stress values. The algorithm maintains $O(|E|)$ complexity for both weighted and unweighted graphs. Our work establishes a connection between spectral graph theory and stress-based layouts, providing a practical and scalable solution for network visualization.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Hierarchical Structure in LLM Embeddings with $\delta$-Hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20926</link>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled significant strides in various fields. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM embeddings in the context of inherent geometric properties. We investigate the structural properties of these embeddings through three complementary metrics $\delta$-hyperbolicity, Ultrametricity, and Neighbor Joining. $\delta$-hyperbolicity, a measure derived from geometric group theory, quantifies how much a metric space deviates from being a tree-like structure. In contrast, ultrametricity characterizes strictly hierarchical structures where distances obey a strong triangle inequality. While Neighbor Joining quantifies how tree-like the distance relationships are, it does so specifically with respect to the tree reconstructed by the Neighbor Joining algorithm. By analyzing the embeddings generated by LLMs using these metrics, we uncover to what extent the embedding space reflects an underlying hierarchical or tree-like organization. Our findings reveal that LLM embeddings exhibit varying degrees of hyperbolicity and ultrametricity, which correlate with their performance in the underlying machine learning tasks.</description>
