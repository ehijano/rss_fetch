      <title>Metrics on Permutation Families Defined by a Restriction Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the metric structure of permutation families is fundamental to combinatorics and has applications in social choice theory, bioinformatics, and coding theory. We study permutation families defined by restriction graphs--oriented graphs that constrain the relative order of elements in valid permutations. For any restriction graph $G$, we determine the maximum distance achievable by two permutations under the $\ell_\infty$-metric and provide an explicit algorithm that constructs optimal permutation pairs. Our main contribution characterizes when the Kendall-Tau metric achieves its combinatorial upper bound: this occurs if and only if the poset induced by $G$ has dimension at most 2. When this condition holds, the extremal permutations form a minimal realizer of the poset, revealing a deep connection between metric geometry and poset dimension theory. We apply these results to classical permutation statistics including descent sets and Hessenberg varieties, obtaining explicit formulas and efficient algorithms for computing metric diameters.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing of Glauber Dynamics for Monotone Systems via Entropic Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of Glauber dynamics on monotone systems. For monotone systems satisfying the entropic independence condition, we prove a new mixing time comparison result for Glauber dynamics. For concrete applications, we obtain $\tilde{O}(n)$ mixing time for the random cluster model induced by the ferromagnetic Ising model with consistently biased external fields, and $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ mixing time for the bipartite hardcore model under the one-sided uniqueness condition, where $n$ is the number of variables in corresponding models, improving the best known results in [Chen and Zhang, SODA'23] and [Chen, Liu, and Yin, FOCS'23], respectively.
  Our proof combines ideas from the stochastic dominance argument in the classical censoring inequality and the recently developed high-dimensional expanders. The key step in the proof is a novel comparison result between the Glauber dynamics and the field dynamics for monotone systems.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for dominating set reconfiguration on sparse (directed) graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a graph, a vertex dominates itself and its neighbors, and a dominating set is a set of vertices that together dominate the entire graph. Given a graph and two dominating sets of equal size $k$, the {\em Dominating Set Reconfiguration with Token sliding} (DSR-TS) problem asks whether one can, by iteratively replacing a vertex by an adjacent one, transform the first set into the second one, while ensuring that every set during the reconfiguration process is a dominating set.
  The token jumping variant, where a vertex can be replaced by a non-adjacent one, is known to be efficiently solvable on many graph classes such as planar, bounded treewidth, and the very broad notion of nowhere-dense classes of graphs. Alternatively, some algorithms also exist for the reconfiguration of independent sets in the token sliding paradigm for graph classes with bounded degree or large girth.
  We show that DSR-TS is W[2]-hard when parameterized $k$, the pathwidth of the instance, and the iteration of the reconfiguration sequence (a recently introduced parameter). This is a setting where both the token jumping and the independent set variants are fixed parameter tractable. Not restricting the iteration yields W[2] hardness already on graphs with treewidth 9 and pathwidth 13.
  In the directed variant (DSR-DTS), we are only allowed to replace a vertex with an out-neighbor. We show that DSR-DTS is NP-hard on DAGs of treewidth 5 and W[2]-hard for both the case of DAGs of depth 3 parameterized by $k$, and the case of DAGs when parameterized by $k$ and the pathwidth of the instance (independent set reconfiguration is again FPT in both settings).</description>

      <title>Interaction between skew-representability, tensor products, extension properties, and rank inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skew-representable matroids form a fundamental class in matroid theory, bridging combinatorics and linear algebra. They play an important role in areas such as coding theory, optimization, and combinatorial geometry, where linear structure is crucial for both theoretical insights and algorithmic applications. Since deciding skew-representability is computationally intractable, much effort has been focused on identifying necessary or sufficient conditions for a matroid to be skew-representable.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to studying skew-representability and structural properties of matroids and polymatroid functions via tensor products. We provide a characterization of skew-representable matroids, as well as of those representable over skew fields of a given prime characteristic, in terms of tensor products. As an algorithmic consequence, we show that deciding skew-representability, or representability over a skew field of fixed prime characteristic, is co-recursively enumerable: that is, certificates of non-skew-representability -- in general or over a fixed prime characteristic -- can be verified. We also prove that every rank-3 matroid admits a tensor product with any uniform matroid and give a construction yielding the unique freest tensor product in this setting. Finally, as an application of the tensor product framework, we give a new proof of Ingleton's inequality and, more importantly, derive the first known linear rank inequality for folded skew-representable matroids that does not follow from the common information property.</description>

      <title>Covering Complete Geometric Graphs by Monotone Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set $A$ of $n$ points (vertices) in general position in the plane, the \emph{complete geometric graph} $K_n[A]$ consists of all ${n\choose 2}$ segments (edges) between the elements of $A$. It is known that the edge set of every complete geometric graph on $n$ vertices can be partitioned into $O(n^{3/2})$ noncrossing paths (or matchings). We strengthen this result under various additional assumptions on the point set. In particular, we prove that for a set $A$ of $n$ \emph{randomly} selected points, uniformly distributed in $[0,1]^2$, with probability tending to $1$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, the edge set of $K_n[A]$ can be covered by $O(n^{4/3} t(n))$ noncrossing paths (or matchings), where $t(n)$ is any function tending to $\infty$. On the other hand, we construct $n$-element point sets such that covering the edge set of $K_n(A)$ requires a quadratic number of monotone paths.</description>

      <title>Convolutive sequences, I: Through the lens of integer partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the convolutive behavior of the counting function for partitions with designated summands in which all parts are odd, we consider coefficient sequences $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ of primitive eta-products that satisfy the generic convolutive property
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n\ge 0} a_{mn} q^n = \left(\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n q^n\right)^m
  \end{align*}
  for a specific positive integer $m$. Given the results of an exhaustive search of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for $m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly paid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective proofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we apply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also give two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other convolutive series that are not eta-products.</description>

      <title>On Tight Robust Coresets for $k$-Medians Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers coresets for the robust $k$-medians problem with $m$ outliers, and new constructions in various metric spaces are obtained. Specifically, for metric spaces with a bounded VC or doubling dimension $d$, the coreset size is $O(m) + \tilde{O}(kd\varepsilon^{-2})$, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. For Euclidean spaces, the coreset size is $O(m\varepsilon^{-1}) + \tilde{O}(\min\{k^{4/3}\varepsilon^{-2},k\varepsilon^{-3}\})$, improving upon a recent result by Jiang and Lou (ICALP 2025). These results also extend to robust $(k,z)$-clustering, yielding, for VC and doubling dimension, a coreset size of $O(m) + \tilde{O}(kd\varepsilon^{-2z})$ with the optimal linear dependence on $m$. This extended result improves upon the earlier work of Huang et al. (SODA 2025). The techniques introduce novel dataset decompositions, enabling chaining arguments to be applied jointly across multiple components.</description>

      <title>Verification of Hamiltonian Path Conjecture (BHR Conjecture) for Integers up to p=31 based on one multiset per FP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a computational approach to verify a specific conjecture concerning Hamiltonian paths in complete graphs with prescribed edge lengths, often referred to as the Buratti $-$ Horak-Rosa Conjecture. Building upon prior computational work by Mariusz Meszka which verified the conjecture for all primes up to 23, our Python program does the BHR conjecture verification for composite and prime numbers up to p=32 in a different way by taking into account one mulltiset per frequency partition (FP). We report successful computational verification for all frequency partitions for integers $p &lt; 32$, specifically presenting results for $p=31$. For the composite number $p = 30$, the Python code took approximately 11 hours to verify on a Lenovo laptop. The method systematically generates frequency partitions of edge lengths and employs a recursive backtracking algorithm to construct the corresponding Hamiltonian paths. The presented program is optimized for efficiency and designed for scalability, allowing for its utilization on more powerful computing resources to explore even higher integer values, thereby providing further evidence for the conjecture's validity.
  The conjecture of Peter Horak and Alex Rosa (generalizing that of Marco Buratti) states that a multiset L of (p-1) positive integers not exceeding $[p/2]$ is the list of edge lengths of a suitable Hamiltonian path of the complete graph with vertex-set of {1, 2, ..., [p-1]} if and only if for every divisor d of p, the number of multiples of d appearing in L is at most [p-d].</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <title>Secure domination in $P_5$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G$ is a set $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that every vertex in $V(G) \setminus S$ has a neighbor in $S$, where two vertices are neighbors if they are adjacent. A secure dominating set of $G$ is a dominating set $S$ of $G$ with the additional property that for every vertex $v \in V(G) \setminus S$, there exists a neighbor $u$ of $v$ in $S$ such that $(S \setminus \{u\}) \cup \{v\}$ is a dominating set of $G$. The secure domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_s(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a secure dominating set of $G$. We prove that if $G$ is a $P_5$-free graph, then $\gamma_s(G) \le \frac{3}{2}\alpha(G)$, where $\alpha(G)$ denotes the independence number of $G$. We further show that if $G$ is a connected $(P_5, H)$-free graph for some $H \in \{ P_3 \cup P_1, K_2 \cup 2K_1, ~\text{paw},~ C_4\}$, then $\gamma_s(G)\le \max\{3,\alpha(G)\}$. We also show that if $G$ is a $(P_3 \cup P_2)$-free graph, then $\gamma_s(G)\le \alpha(G)+1$.</description>

      <title>Solving Modular Linear Systems with a Constraint by parallel decomposition of the Smith form and extended Euclidean division modulo powers of primes divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integral linear systems $Ax=b$ with matrices $A$, $b$ and solutions $x$ are also required to be in integers, can be solved using invariant factors of $A$ (by computing the Smith Canonical Form of $A$). This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=\la w,x\ra$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</description>
