      <title>Detectability of Solar Panels as a Technosignature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we assess the potential detectability of solar panels made of silicon on an Earth-like exoplanet as a potential technosignature. Silicon-based photovoltaic cells have high reflectance in the UV-VIS and in the near-IR, within the wavelength range of a space-based flagship mission concept like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Assuming that only solar energy is used to provide the 2022 human energy needs with a land cover of ~2.4%, and projecting the future energy demand assuming various growth-rate scenarios, we assess the detectability with an 8 m HWO-like telescope. Assuming the most favorable viewing orientation, and focusing on the strong absorption edge in the ultraviolet-to-visible (0.34 - 0.52 um), we find that several 100s of hours of observation time is needed to reach a SNR of 5 for an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10pc, even with a solar panel coverage of ~23% land coverage of a future Earth. We discuss the necessity of concepts like Kardeshev Type I/II civilizations and Dyson spheres, which would aim to harness vast amounts of energy. Even with much larger populations than today, the total energy use of human civilization would be orders of magnitude below the threshold for causing direct thermal heating or reaching the scale of a Kardashev Type I civilization. Any extraterrrestrial civilization that likewise achieves sustainable population levels may also find a limit on its need to expand, which suggests that a galaxy-spanning civilization as imagined in the Fermi paradox may not exist.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forward Modeling of Galaxy Catalogs with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy and calibration of the redshift posteriors produced by photometric redshift (photo-z) estimators is vital for enabling precision cosmology and extragalactic astrophysics with modern wide-field photometric surveys. Evaluating photo-z posteriors on a per-galaxy basis is difficult, however, as real galaxies have a true redshift but not a true redshift posterior. We introduce PZFlow, a Python package for the probabilistic forward modeling of galaxy catalogs with normalizing flows. For catalogs simulated with PZFlow, there is a natural notion of "true" redshift posteriors that can be used for photo-z validation. We use PZFlow to simulate a photometric galaxy catalog where each galaxy has a redshift, noisy photometry, shape information, and a true redshift posterior. We also demonstrate the use of an ensemble of normalizing flows for photo-z estimation. We discuss how PZFlow will be used to validate the photo-z estimation pipeline of the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), and the wider applicability of PZFlow for statistical modeling of any tabular data.</description>

      <title>A Method of Measuring TES Complex ETF Response in Frequency-domain Multiplexed Readout by Single Sideband Power Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital frequency domain multiplexing (DfMux) technique is widely used for astrophysical instruments with large detector arrays. Detailed detector characterization is required for instrument calibration and systematics control. We conduct the TES complex electrothermal-feedback (ETF) response measurement with the DfMux readout system as follows. By injecting a single sideband signal, we induce modulation in TES power dissipation over a frequency range encompassing the detector response. The modulated current signal induced by TES heating effect is measured, allowing for the ETF response characterization of the detector. With the injection of an upper sideband, the TES readout current shows both an upper and a lower sideband. We model the upper and lower sideband complex ETF response and verify the model by fitting to experimental data. The model not only can fit for certain physical parameters of the detector, such as loop gain, temperature sensitivity, current sensitivity, and time constant, but also enables us to estimate the systematic effect introduced by the multiplexed readout. The method is therefore useful for in-situ detector calibration and for estimating systematic effects during astronomical telescope observations, such as those performed by the upcoming LiteBIRD satellite.</description>

      <title>On-ground calibration of the X-ray, gamma-ray, and relativistic electron detector onboard TARANIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed the X-ray, Gamma-ray and Relativistic Electron detector (XGRE) onboard the TARANIS satellite, to investigate high-energy phenomena associated with lightning discharges such as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes and terrestrial electron beams. XGRE consisted of three sensors. Each sensor has one layer of LaBr$_{3}$ crystals for X-ray/gamma-ray detections, and two layers of plastic scintillators for electron and charged-particle discrimination. Since 2018, the flight model of XGRE was developed, and validation and calibration tests, such as a thermal cycle test and a calibration test with the sensors onboard the satellite were performed before the launch of TARANIS on 17 November 2020. The energy range of the LaBr$_{3}$ crystals sensitive to X-rays and gamma rays was determined to be 0.04-11.6 MeV, 0.08-11.0 MeV, and 0.08-11.3 MeV for XGRE1, 2, and 3, respectively. The energy resolution at 0.662 MeV (full width at half maximum) was to be 20.5%, 25.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. Results from the calibration test were then used to validate a simulation model of XGRE and TARANIS. By performing Monte Carlo simulations with the verified model, we calculated effective areas of XGRE to X-rays, gamma rays, electrons, and detector responses to incident photons and electrons coming from various elevation and azimuth angles.</description>

      <title>Quality assurance of actuators for the Medium-Sized Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a future ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy providing unparalleled sensitivity in the energy range from 20 GeV up to 300 TeV. CTA will consist of telescopes with three different sizes. The Medium-Sized Telescopes (MSTs) will have 12 m reflectors with a tessellated mirror design of 86 mirror facets each. Each mirror facet is mounted on the mirror support structure with two actuators that are adjustable in length to align the mirrors, and a freely rotating fixpoint. Image resolution and pointing accuracy constraints impose limits on the backlash and deformation of the actuators and the fixpoint under various weight and wind loads. In this contribution, the test stand to measure the backlash and deformation behaviour of actuators and fixpoints is described and the measurement procedure is explained.</description>

      <title>ContEvol formalism: possibly a new twist on computational physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ContEvol (continuous evolution) formalism, a family of implicit numerical methods which only need to solve linear equations and are almost symplectic. Combining values and derivatives of functions, ContEvol outputs allow users to recover full history and render full distributions. Using classic harmonic oscillator as a prototype case, we show that ContEvol methods lead to lower-order errors than two commonly used Runge--Kutta methods. Applying first-order ContEvol to simple celestial mechanics problems, we demonstrate that deviation from equation(s) of motion of ContEvol tracks is still $\mathcal{O}(h^5)$ ($h$ is the step length) by our definition. Numerical experiments with an eccentric elliptical orbit indicate that first-order ContEvol is a viable alternative to classic Runge--Kutta or the symplectic leapfrog integrator. Solving stationary Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics, we manifest ability of ContEvol to handle boundary value or eigenvalue problems. Important directions for future work, including mathematical foundation, higher dimensions, and technical improvements, are discussed at the end of this article.</description>

      <title>Automation of MKID Simulations for Array Building with AEM (Automated Electromagnetic MKID Simulations)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) are photon detectors comprised of superconducting LC resonators with unique resonant frequencies corresponding to their geometrical structure. As each pixel has its own geometry, electromagnetic simulations by hand of every pixel in a kilo-pixel array are impractical. Simulating fewer pixels and interpolating in between risks reduced pixel yield in arrays due to overlapping resonant frequencies. We introduce a new software called AEM (Automated Electromagnetic MKID simulations) that automates the constructions and simulations of every simulated MKID pixel in an array according to specified resonant frequencies and a Qc range. We show automated designs to have an increased pixel yield (avoiding loses due to interpolation completely), increased accuracy in resonance frequency and Qc values when compared to interpolated structures. We also demonstrate a simulated trial of AEM for 100 MKIDs between 4 &amp; 8 GHz to produce MKIDs with accuracies of +-0.2 MHz with a runtime of 10 hrs 45 mins.</description>

      <title>In-depth analysis of LISA Pathfinder performance results: time evolution, noise projection, physical models, and implications for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the LISA Pathfinder differential acceleration performance over the entire mission . We show that the Brownian noise level, detected for frequencies $f\gtrsim \SI{1}{mHz}$, has been evolving consistently with the outgassing of a single gaseous species, with an activation temperature of $(7.0\pm 0.2)\,\text{kK}$. In excess to the Brownian noise, the acceleration amplitude spectral density (ASD) always shows a sub-mHz tail which is reasonably well fit, between $f=\SI{36}{\micro\hertz}$ and $\SI{1}{\milli\hertz}$, to $\widetilde{S}_{\Delta g}^{1/2}(1\, \text{mHz}/f)$. A Bayesian estimate of $\widetilde{S}_{\Delta g}^{1/2}$ on a partition of the entire set of measurements in 27 data stretches, each 2.75\,d long, gives $\widetilde{S}_{\Delta g}^{1/2}=(1.1\pm0.3)\,\si{\femto\meter\,\second^{-2}/\rtHz}$, with no particular time pattern over the course of the mission. The width the posterior contains, in excess of the statistical uncertainty, a true physical fluctuation of $\widetilde{S}_{\Delta g}^{1/2}$ from run to run, of about $\SI{0.2}{\femto\meter\,\second^{-2}/\rtHz}$, with no correlation with specific operating conditions. At the lowest considered frequency of $f=\SI{18}{\micro\hertz}$, the ASD significantly deviates from the $1/f$ behavior, because of temperature fluctuations that appear to modulate a quasi-static pressure gradient, sustained by the asymmetries of outgassing . We also present a projection of acceleration noise on the sources for which we had either a correlation measurement, or an estimate from dedicated experiments.These sources account for about 40\% of the noise power the $1/f$ tail. We discuss the possible sources of the unaccounted-for fraction, present a series of analyses that rule many of them out, and identify the possible measures that may be taken to keep the remaining ones under control in LISA.</description>

      <title>DanceCam: atmospheric turbulence mitigation in wide-field astronomical images with short-exposure video streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique to mitigate the adverse effects of atmospheric turbulence on astronomical imaging. Utilizing a video-to-image neural network trained on simulated data, our method processes a sliding sequence of short-exposure ($\sim$0.2s) stellar field images to reconstruct an image devoid of both turbulence and noise. We demonstrate the method with simulated and observed stellar fields, and show that the brief exposure sequence allows the network to accurately associate speckles to their originating stars and effectively disentangle light from adjacent sources across a range of seeing conditions, all while preserving flux to a lower signal-to-noise ratio than an average stack. This approach results in a marked improvement in angular resolution without compromising the astrometric stability of the final image.</description>

      <title>Component Separation method for CMB using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this project is to recover the CMB anisotropies maps in temperature and polarized intensity by means of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which, after appropiate training, can remove the foregrounds from Planck and QUIJOTE data. The results are then compared with those obtained by COMMANDER, based on Bayesian parametric component separation. The CNN successfully recovered the CMB signal for both All Sky and Partial Sky maps showing frequency dependant results, being optimum for central frequencies where there is less contamination by foregrounds emissions such as galactic synchrotron and thermal dust emissions. Recovered maps in temperature are consistent with those obtained by Planck Collaboration, while polarized intensity has been recovered as a new observable. The polarized intensity maps recovered from QUIJOTE experiment are novel and of potential interest to the scientific community for the detection of primordial gravitational waves. The way forward will be to recover the maps at higher NSIDE and make them available to the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Artificial Broadcasts as Galactic Populations: I. A Point Process Formalism for Extraterrestrial Intelligences and Their Broadcasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial broadcasts from extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) are a hypothetical class of celestial phenomena. Unlike known astrophysical objects, the societies that generate them may be able to replicate on galactic scales through interstellar travel. Different galaxies could thus have drastically different populations, with abundance variations of many orders of magnitude. I present a probabilistic formalism to treat this shared history, in which societies and their broadcasts are described by distributions over basic properties like lifespan and energy released. The framework contains a hierarchy of objects related by a tree structure. Discrete societies, the sources of broadcasts, are organized into potentially interstellar "metasocieties." The population of each type of object is represented by a random point process in an abstract parameter hyperspace, a "haystack." When a selection like an observation draws a sample, the point process is thinned. Given assumptions of interchangeability and independence, observables are modeled with compound Poisson random variables. I present an example of how selection bias can favor sampling longer-lived objects. I rederive the Drake Equation for societies in the limit of no expansion. When interstellar replication is present, however, the mean number of detected broadcasts can depend quadratically on stellar mass, suggesting a search strategy favoring large galaxies.</description>

      <title>Artificial Broadcasts as Galactic Populations: II. Comparing Individualist and Collective Bounds on Broadcast Populations in Single Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial intelligence includes efforts to constrain populations of artificial broadcasts in other galaxies. Previous efforts use individualist methods, searching for single broadcasts with high signal-to-noise ratio. These would be detected as observables with extreme values. This approach is limited to very bright broadcasts and also is subject to confusion, where a large number of broadcasts blend together to form a noise continuum. The mean value of the total emission provides an additional collective bound: the luminosity of the transmitters is no higher than the galaxy's observed luminosity. Using the framework developed in Paper I, I evaluate how confusion affects individualist searches. I then compare individualist and collective approaches for radio broadcasts from the Milky Way, M31, and three Virgo Cluster elliptical galaxies. For current observations, confusion blurs narrowband radio broadcasts together in the Virgo ellipticals when there is one broadcast per gigahertz per 1000 stars. The collective bound implies fewer than $\sim 10^6 (\overline{\ell}/10^{13} W)^{-1}$ L-band broadcasts per star gigahertz GHz in the Milky Way and is about 10 and 400 times stronger in M31 and M59, respectively. Applying the collective bound to the far-infrared--radio correlation yields constraints on radio broadcast populations in star-forming galaxies throughout the Universe. The collective bound allows us to rule out large regions of broadcast population parameter space even for distant galaxies. It also imposes constraints on gamma-ray, neutrino, and gravitational-wave broadcasts in the nearest galaxies.</description>

      <title>An efficient GPU-accelerated multi-source global fit pipeline for LISA data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale analysis task of deciphering gravitational wave signals in the LISA data stream will be difficult, requiring a large amount of computational resources and extensive development of computational methods. Its high dimensionality, multiple model types, and complicated noise profile require a global fit to all parameters and input models simultaneously. In this work, we detail our global fit algorithm, called "Erebor," designed to accomplish this challenging task. It is capable of analysing current state-of-the-art datasets and then growing into the future as more pieces of the pipeline are completed and added. We describe our pipeline strategy, the algorithmic setup, and the results from our analysis of the LDC2A Sangria dataset, which contains Massive Black Hole Binaries, compact Galactic Binaries, and a parameterized noise spectrum whose parameters are unknown to the user. We recover posterior distributions for all 15 (6) of the injected MBHBs in the LDC2A training (hidden) dataset. We catalog $\sim12000$ Galactic Binaries ($\sim8000$ as high confidence detections) for both the training and hidden datasets. All of the sources and their posterior distributions are provided in publicly available catalogs.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Dynamical Classification of Trans-Neptunian Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are small, icy bodies in the outer solar system. They are observed to have a complex orbital distribution that was shaped by the early dynamical history and migration of the giant planets. Comparisons between the different dynamical classes of modeled and observed TNOs can help constrain the history of the outer solar system. Because of the complex dynamics of TNOs, particularly those in and near mean motion resonances with Neptune, classification has traditionally been done by human inspection of plots of the time evolution of orbital parameters. This is very inefficient. The Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to increase the number of known TNOs by a factor of $\sim$10, necessitating a much more automated process. In this chapter we present an improved supervised machine learning classifier for TNOs. Using a large and diverse training set as well as carefully chosen, dynamically motivated data features calculated from numerical integrations of TNO orbits, our classifier returns results that match those of a human classifier 98% of the time, and dynamically relevant classifications 99.7% of the time. This classifier is dramatically more efficient than human classification, and it will improve classification of both observed and modeled TNO data.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Beam characterization for the Small Aperture Telescopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use time-domain simulations of Jupiter observations to test and develop a beam reconstruction pipeline for the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes. The method relies on a map maker that estimates and subtracts correlated atmospheric noise and a beam fitting code designed to compensate for the bias caused by the map maker. We test our reconstruction performance for four different frequency bands against various algorithmic parameters, atmospheric conditions and input beams. We additionally show the reconstruction quality as function of the number of available observations and investigate how different calibration strategies affect the beam uncertainty. For all of the cases considered, we find good agreement between the fitted results and the input beam model within a ~1.5% error for a multipole range l = 30 - 700 and an ~0.5% error for a multipole range l = 50 - 200. We conclude by using a harmonic-domain component separation algorithm to verify that the beam reconstruction errors and biases observed in our analysis do not significantly bias the Simons Observatory r-measurement.</description>

      <title>PlatoSim: An end-to-end PLATO camera simulator for modelling high-precision space-based photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is the ESA M3 space mission dedicated to detect and characterise transiting exoplanets including information from the asteroseismic properties of their stellar hosts. The uninterrupted and high-precision photometry provided by space-borne instruments such as PLATO require long preparatory phases. An exhaustive list of tests are paramount to design a mission that meets the performance requirements, and as such, simulations are an indispensable tool in the mission preparation. To accommodate PLATO's need of versatile simulations prior to mission launch - that at the same time describe accurately the innovative but complex multi-telescope design - we here present the end-to-end PLATO simulator specifically developed for the purpose, namely PlatoSim. We show step-by-step the algorithms embedded into the software architecture of PlatoSim that allow the user to simulate photometric time series of CCD images and light curves in accordance to the expected observations of PLATO. In the context of the PLATO payload, a general formalism of modelling, end-to-end, incoming photons from the sky to the final measurement in digital units is discussed. We show the strong predictive power of PlatoSim through its diverse applicability and contribution to numerous working groups within the PLATO Mission Consortium. This involves the on-going mechanical integration and alignment, performance studies of the payload, the pipeline development and assessments of the scientific goals. PlatoSim is a state-of-the-art simulator that is able to produce the expected photometric observations of PLATO to a high level of accuracy. We demonstrate that PlatoSim is a key software tool for the PLATO mission in the preparatory phases until mission launch and prospectively beyond.</description>

      <title>A design method of an ultra wideband and easy-to-array Magic-T: A 6-14 GHz scaled model for a mm/submm camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We established a design method for a Magic-T with a single-layer dielectric/metal structure suitable for both wideband and multi-element applications for millimeter and submillimeter wave imaging observations. The design method was applied to a Magic-T with a coupled-line, stubs, and single-stage impedance transformers in a frequency-scaled model (6-14 GHz) that is relatively easy to demonstrate through manufacturing and evaluation. The major problem is that using the conventional perfect matching condition for a coupled-line alone produces an impractically large width coplanar coupled-line (CPCL) to satisfy the desired bandwidth ratio. In our study, by removing this constraint and optimizing impedances utilizing a circuit simulator with high computation speed, we found a solution with a $\sim$ 180 $\rm \mu$m wide CPCL, which is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the conventional analytical solution. Furthermore, considering the effect of transition discontinuities in the transmission lines, we optimized the line length and obtained a design solution with return loss &lt; -20 dB, amplitude imbalance &lt; 0.1 dB, and phase imbalance &lt; 0.5$^\circ$ from 6.1 GHz to 14.1 GHz.</description>

      <title>Geometry dependence of TLS noise and loss in a-SiC:H parallel plate capacitors for superconducting microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel plate capacitors (PPC) significantly reduce the size of superconducting microwave resonators, reducing the pixel pitch for arrays of single photon energy-resolving kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The frequency noise of KIDs is typically limited by tunneling Two-Level Systems (TLS), which originate from lattice defects in the dielectric materials required for PPCs. How the frequency noise level depends on the PPC's dimensions has not been experimentally addressed. We measure the frequency noise of 56 resonators with a-SiC:H PPCs, which cover a factor 44 in PPC area and a factor 4 in dielectric thickness. To support the noise analysis, we measure the TLS-induced, power-dependent, intrinsic loss and temperature-dependent resonance frequency shift of the resonators. From the TLS models, we expect a geometry-independent microwave loss and resonance frequency shift, set by the TLS properties of the dielectric. However, we observe a thickness-dependent microwave loss and resonance frequency shift, explained by surface layers that limit the performance of PPC-based resonators. For a uniform dielectric, the frequency noise level should scale directly inversely with the PPC area and thickness. We observe that an increase in PPC size reduces the frequency noise, but the exact scaling is, in some cases, weaker than expected. Finally, we derive an engineering guideline for the design of KIDs based on PPC-based resonators.</description>

      <title>Radon Concentration Measurement with a High-Sensitivity Radon Detector at the Yemilab</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation emitted from radon is a critical background in rare event search experiments conducted at the Yemi Underground Laboratory (Yemilab) in Jeongseon, Korea. A Radon Reduction System(RRS) has been developed and installed in Yemilab to reduce radon concentration in the air. The RRS primarily provides a purified air of 50 m3/h to the cleanroom used to assemble crystal detectors in the AMoRE, a neutrinoless double beta decay search experiment. RRS can reduce the radon level by a factor of 300, so a high-sensitivity radon detector was required. A highly sensitive radon detector was constructed using a 70 L chamber with a large PIN photodiode to measure radon concentration in the purified air. The radon detector shows an excellent resolution of 72 keV (FWHM) for 6.003 MeV alphas from 218Po decay and a sensitivity down to 23.8 +- 2.1 mBq/m3 with a boil-off N2 gas sample. The radon concentration level from the RRS measured by the radon detector was below 0.29 Bq/m3 with a reduction factor of about 300.</description>

Abstract: Over the past 4 decades, the exploration of planets beyond our solar system has yielded the discovery of over 5600 exoplanets orbiting different stars. Continuous advancements in instrumentation and cutting-edge techniques empower astronomers to unveil and characterize new exoworlds with increasing frequency. Notably, direct imaging, also called high-contrast imaging (HCI), stands out as the only method capable of capturing photons emitted directly from the planetary bodies. This innovative technique proves particularly advantageous for scrutinizing nascent planetary systems, where planets shine brilliantly and emit significant heat during their initial developmental phases. HCI provides comprehensive visuals of the entire system, encompassing the central star, potential circumstellar disks, and any additional companions. However, the complexity of imaging an object 10^6 fainter than its parent star necessitates state-of-the-art instrumentation. HCI demands cutting-edge tools such as exAO systems, telescopes exceeding 8 meters in diameter, coronagraphs, and modern imagers. The pivotal role of post-processing cannot be overstated in the quest for detecting and characterizing planets through HCI. This method has not only facilitated the discovery of numerous planets but has also presented invaluable opportunities to explore the properties of young substellar companions, both planets and brown dwarfs. Insights into their interactions with parent disks or other companions within the system, the composition of their atmospheres, and the identification of still accreting planets, also known as "protoplanets," contribute significantly to our understanding of planet formation scenarios. The continued refinement of HCI promises to unveil further revelations in the captivating field of exoplanetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Polarization Detection with Pyramid Constellation of Gravitational Wave Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we have introduced the Pyramid Constellation of Gravitational Wave Observatory (PCGO) for GW polarization detection. The PCGO is composed of four identical spacecrafts (S/Cs). The laser telescopes and their pointing structures are mounted on the S/C platform and are evenly distributed at three locations 120 degrees apart. Compared to a three-S/C configuration, the addition of a fourth S/C and its mounted telescope serve as redundant backups, especially for the telescopes, which together with the other two telescopes, automatically form a stable mass center for the platform without the need for trim mass. Since the radial distance of S/C4 is greater than that of the other spacecraft, the three arm lengths associated with S/C4 change significantly over a one-year period. Time delay interferometry (TDI) has been proven effective for suppressing frequency noise in this context. The unequal arm Michelson TDI configuration and the Sagnac TDI configuration are equally effective for eliminating the laser frequency noise based on the PCGO configuration. Compared to the configurations of LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, the PCGO has more combinations of optical paths in its TDI system, offering greater sensitivity to GW signals. The configuration of PCGO is simultaneously sensitive to the six polarization modes of GWs, which means that it allows for greater flexibility in extracting the polarization components from the total GW polarization signals.</description>

      <title>The Chemical Composition of Ryugu: Prospects as a Reference Material for Solar System Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hayabusa 2 spacecraft sampled approximately 5.4 g of asteroid material from the Cb-type asteroid Ryugu. Initial analysis of the Ryugu materials revealed a mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic kinship to the CI chondrites. The pristine nature of Ryugu makes the returned samples ideal for constraining the composition of the Solar System. However, some elements (e.g., P, Ca, Mn, and rare earth elements) show large relative dispersions compared to the other elements in the returned materials studied so far, most likely due to the presence of aqueously formed secondary minerals (e.g., carbonates, phosphates) in Ryugu. Therefore, the estimation of the Solar System composition using currently available Ryugu data is challenging due to the so-called nugget effect of carbonates, phosphates, and possibly other accessory minerals. The nugget effect can be mitigated by analyzing a homogenized, relatively large amount of sample. We estimate that for approximately 0.1 g of Ryugu sample, the dispersion (2SD) of the bulk Mn/Cr and Rb/Sr ratios are +/-13% and +/-15%, respectively, while they will be improved to be better than +/-5% for approximately 1 g of homogenized Ryugu sample. To further constrain the Solar System composition and to evaluate if previous estimates based on CI chondrites stored in museums for decades to centuries are reliable, it is strongly recommended to determine the chemical and isotopic compositions of Ryugu using a homogenized sample prepared from relatively large (approx. 1 g) returned material. Determining Ryugu reference compositions will be used by multidisciplinary communities, including Earth and planetary sciences, astronomy, physics, and chemistry.</description>
