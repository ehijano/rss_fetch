      <title>Vladimir Voevodsky on the concept of mathematical structure in his letter exchange with Andrei Rodin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016 Vladimir Voevodsky sent the author an email message where he explained his conception of mathematical structure using a historical example borrowed from the \emph{Commentary to the First Book of Euclid's Elements} by Proclus; this message was followed by a short exchange where Vladimir clarified his conception of structure. In this Chapter Voevodsky's historical example is explained in detail, and the relevance of Voevodsky's conception of mathematical structure in Homotopy Type theory is shown. The Chapter also discusses some related historical and philosophical issues risen by Vladimir Voevodsky in the same email exchange. This includes a comparison of Voevodsky's conception of mathematical structure and other conceptions of structure found in the current literature. The concluding part of this Chapter includes relevant fragments of the email exchange between Vladimir Voevodsky and the author.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model of The Effects of Strike On Nigerian Universities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper carries out a scientific study of the effects of strike on Nigerian Universities. A mathematical model is formulated to examine the behavior of Nigerian University System when Public Universities are on strike. The results show that if all State and Federal Universities are on strike with the exception of the Private Universities, the University System in Nigeria is locally asymptotically stable.</description>

      <title>Winning Lights Out with Fibonacci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lights Out is a single-player electronic handheld game from the 1990s that features a 5 by 5 grid of light-up buttons. The game begins with some lights on and others off. The goal is to turn off all lights but pressing a button changes its state and changes the states of the buttons above and below and to the left and right of the button. We examine a cylindrical Lights Out game in which the left side of the board is connected to the right. Moreover, instead of just on and off we let the lights have $k$ states for $k \ge 2$. We then apply a modified light chasing strategy in which we try to systematically turn off all lights in a row by pressing the buttons in the row below. We ask if the game begins with all lights starting at the same state, how many rows must the board have in order for all lights to be turned off using this type of modified light chasing after we press the last row of lights. We connect this light chasing strategy to the Fibonacci numbers and are able to provide answer to our question by studying the Fibonacci numbers (mod $k$).</description>

      <title>Generalized Carlos Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1986, composer Wendy Carlos introduced three unusual musical scales she called alpha, beta and gamma, equal temperament-inspired scales that de-emphasize the octave as the primary interval in favor of the major and minor thirds and the perfect fifth. A derivation of the alpha, beta, and gamma scales due to David Benson is generalized to produce many Carlos-type scales.</description>
