      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Simulations of Graphene Analogues: Adsorption Energetics Beyond DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding strongly correlated systems is essential for advancing quantum chemistry and materials science, yet conventional methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) often fail to capture their complex electronic behavior. To address these limitations, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates Multiconfigurational Self Consistent Field (MCSCF) with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our initial benchmarks on water dissociation enabled the systematic optimization of key computational parameters, including ansatz selection, active space construction, and error mitigation. Building on this, we extend our approach to investigate the interactions between graphene analogues and water, demonstrating that our framework produces binding energies consistent with high accuracy quantum methods. Furthermore, we apply this methodology to predict the binding energies of transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) on both pristine and defective graphene analogues, revealing strong charge transfer effects and pronounced multireference character phenomena often misrepresented by standard DFT. In contrast to many existing quantum algorithms that are constrained to small molecular systems, our framework achieves chemically accurate predictions for larger, strongly correlated systems such as metal graphene complexes. This advancement highlights the capacity of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to address complex electronic interactions and demonstrates a practical route toward realizing quantum advantage for real world materials applications in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description>

      <title>Convex Hartree-Fock theory: A simple framework for ground state conical intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of conical intersections is crucial in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, as these features govern processes such as radiationless transitions and photochemical reactions. Conventional electronic structure methods, including Hartree-Fock, density functional theory, and their time-dependent extensions, struggle in this regime. Due to their single reference nature and separate treatment of ground and excited states, they fail to capture ground state intersections. Multiconfigurational approaches overcome these limitations, but at a prohibitive computational cost. In this work, we propose a modified Hartree-Fock framework, referred to as Convex Hartree-Fock, that optimizes the reference within a tailored subspace by removing projections along selected Hessian eigenvectors. The ground and excited states are then obtained through subsequent Hamiltonian diagonalization. We validate the approach across several test cases and benchmark its performance against time-dependent Hartree-Fock within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation.</description>

      <title>Intramolecular Singlet Fission Through a Coherently Coupled Excimer-like Intermediate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singlet Fission (SF) into two triplets offers exciting avenues for high-efficiency photovoltaics and optically initializable qubits. While the chemical space of SF chromophores is ever-expanding, the mechanistic details of electronic-nuclear motions that dictate the photophysics are unclear. Rigid SF dimers with well-defined orientations are necessary to decipher such details. Here, using polarization-controlled white-light two-dimensional and pump-probe spectroscopies, we investigate a new class of contorted naphthalenediimide dimers, recently reported to have a favorable intramolecular SF (iSF) pathway. 2D cross-peaks between the two Davydov components and strongly wavelength-dependent TT1 formation kinetics together implicate a coherently coupled excimer-like intermediate. Enhanced quantum beats in the TT1 photoproduct suggest that inter-chromophore twisting and ruffling motions drive the ~200 fs evolution towards excimer-like intermediate and the subsequent ~2 ps relaxation to the TT1 photoproduct. Polarization anisotropy directly tracks electronic motion during these steps and reveals surprisingly minimal electronic reorientation with significant singlet-triplet mixing throughout the nuclear evolution away from the Franck-Condon geometry towards relaxed TT1. The combination of white-light 2DES and polarization anisotropy experiments presented here lends powerful insights for refinement of the existing theoretical models for iSF, and lays the foundation for a broader mechanistic investigation of iSF across various molecular platforms.</description>

      <title>Jetting with gels: Soft microgel networks stabilize and extend nozzle-free water jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of high-speed liquid jets is crucial for applications ranging from precision printing to needle-free drug delivery, yet it is fundamentally limited by capillary-driven breakup. A common strategy to stabilize jets is to use surfactants to lower surface tension. However, in nozzle-free jetting driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs), extreme deformation rates cause conventional surfactants to desorb, calling for alternative strategies to stabilize jets. In particular, we find that tuning the nanoscale softness of PNIPAM microgels provides a robust, biocompatible strategy to overcome this limitation. Soft, low-cross-linker-density microgels form elastic interfacial networks at the air-water interface that suppress surface tension recovery, delay Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities, and extend SAW-driven jet lengths by up to 44%. In contrast, stiffer microgels lose network cohesion under strain, leading to rapid jet breakup. To gain molecular-level insights, we perform dissipative particle dynamics simulations, which reveal that polymer bridges in soft microgels remain entangled during elongation, maintaining a reduced effective surface tension. Finally, a simple scaling analysis, balancing the SAW-driven kinetic energy imparted to the droplet against the surface energy required to form a jet, quantitatively predicts the observed length enhancement. This surfactant-free, biocompatible approach lays the foundation for long-lived jets, enabling precision needle-free drug delivery, high-speed printing, and other high-strain interfacial flow applications.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Compass Mechanism in Cryptochromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptochrome flavoproteins are prime candidates for mediating magnetic sensing in migratory animals via the radical pair mechanism (RPM), a spin-dependent process initiated by photoinduced electron transfer. The canonical FAD-tryptophan radical pair exhibits pronounced anisotropic hyperfine couplings, enabling sensitivity to geomagnetic fields. However, maintaining spin coherence under physiological conditions and explaining responses to weak radiofrequency fields remain unresolved challenges. Alternative radicals, such as superoxide and ascorbate, have been proposed to enhance anisotropy or suppress decoherence. This review summarizes the quantum basis of magnetoreception, evaluates both canonical and alternative radical pair models, and discusses amplification strategies including triads, spin scavenging, and bystander radicals. Emphasis is placed on how molecular geometry, exchange and dipolar interactions, and hyperfine topology modulate magnetic sensitivity. Key open questions and future directions are outlined, highlighting the need for structural and dynamical data under physiological conditions.</description>

      <title>When Energy and Information Revolutions Meet 2D Janus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The depletion of energy sources, worsening environmental issues, and the quantum limitations of integrated circuits for information storage in the post-Moore era, are pressing global concerns. Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally. This review will strongly promote the advanced academic investigations and industrial applications of 2D Janus materials in energy and information fields.</description>

      <title>From Canonical to Complex: Benchmarking LLM Capabilities in Undergraduate Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics, with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions, reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this domain.</description>

      <title>Approximate calculation of multidimensional first passage times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general, multidimensional barrier crossing problem for diffusive processes under the action of conservative forces is studied with the goal of developing tractable approximations. Particular attention is given to the effect of different statistical interpretations of the stochastic differential equation and to the relation between the approximations and the known, exact solutions to the one-dimensional problem. Beginning with a reasonable, but heuristic, simplifying assumption, a one-dimensional solution to the problem is developed. This is then simplified by introducing further approximations resulting in a sequence of increasingly simple expressions culminating in the classic result of Langer(Ann. Phys. 54, 258 (1969)) and others. The various approximations are tested on two dimensional problems by comparison to simulation results and it is found that the one-dimensional approximations capture most of the non-Arrhenius dependence on the energy barrier which is lost in the Langer approximation while still converging to the latter in the large-barrier limit.</description>

      <title>Bayesian perspectives for quantum states and application to ab initio quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum many-electron problem is not just at the heart of condensed matter phenomena, but also essential for first-principles simulation of chemical phenomena. Strong correlation in chemical systems are prevalent and present a formidable challenge in the simulation of these systems, while predictive phenomena in this domain often also requires a demanding level of accuracy to inform chemical behavior. Efficient representations of the many-electron states of chemical systems are therefore also being inspired by machine learning principles to provide an alternative to established approaches. In this chapter, we review recent progress in this endeavor for quantum chemical problems represented in second quantization, and the particular challenges present in this field. In particular, we focus on the application of Gaussian Process States emerging from efficient representations of the many-body wavefunction with rigorous Bayesian modeling frameworks, allowing for the unification of multiple paradigms under a common umbrella. We show how such models (and other representations derived from machine learning) can be used as novel tools to compute ab initio chemical properties, while in turn also informing the design of machine learning models to extract correlation patterns in classical data.</description>

      <title>A coupled-trajectory approach for decoherence, frustrated hops and internal consistency in surface hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the issues of decoherence, frustrated hops and internal consistency in surface hopping. We demonstrate that moving away from an independent-trajectory picture is the strategy which allows us to propose a robust surface hopping scheme overcoming all these issues at once. Based on the exact factorization and on the idea of coupled trajectories, we consider the swarm of trajectories, that mimics the nuclear dynamics in nonadiabatic processes, as a unique entity. In this way, imposing energy conservation of the swarm and allowing the trajectories to share energy when hops occur clearly indicates the route towards a new surface hopping scheme. Encouraging results are reported, in terms of electronic and vibrational time-dependent properties on the photodynamics of fulvene and 4-(dimethyloamino)benzonitrile, modeled with a full-dimensional linear vibronic coupling Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Towards a multi-dimensional picture of nucleation: The example of liquid condensation through theory and rare event sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While very popular for its ability to provide an elegant conceptual framework, classical nucleation theory (CNT) often fails at quantitatively reproducing most of the experimental and numerical observations of first order transitions. In this paper, we extend CNT by explicitly incorporating the multi-dimensional aspect of nucleation. Focusing on the liquid condensation of a Lennard-Jones gas, we used state of the art rare event sampling simulations to precisely characterize the nucleation event emphasizing the specific features of the critical cluster. Our numerical results indicate a simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a 2-variable nucleation theory. Our model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties. Furthermore, our model provides a qualitatively more accurate representation of nucleation near the spinodal regime. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework highlights the limitations of CNT and more recent theories while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.</description>

      <title>Node-Equivariant Message Passing for Efficient and Accurate Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learned interatomic potentials, particularly equivariant message-passing (MP) models, have demonstrated high fidelity in representing first-principles data, revolutionizing computational studies in materials science, biophysics, and catalysis. However, these equivariant MP models still incur substantial computational and memory needs due to their expensive tensor product operations over edge space, significantly limiting their applicability in large-scale or long-time simulations. In this work, we propose a node-equivariant MP (NEMP) framework that performs equivariant operations between the central node and a virtual summed node encoding structure information of its neighbors. Crucially, NEMP maintains comparable or even superior accuracy across diverse test systems-including molecules, extended systems, and universal potential benchmarks-while achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude reduction in memory and computational costs compared to edge equivariant MP models. In fact, NEMP reaches computational efficiency comparable to that of local descriptor-based models, and enabling previously inaccessible large-scale simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a perspective on molecular machine learning (ML) in the field of chemical process engineering. Recently, molecular ML has demonstrated great potential in (i) providing highly accurate predictions for properties of pure components and their mixtures, and (ii) exploring the chemical space for new molecular structures. We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored. We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule and process design benchmarks and practically validate proposed candidates, possibly in collaboration with the chemical industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in nearly-spherical molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular [2\,+\,2] cycloaddition bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular C$-$C single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>

Abstract: The random phase approximation (RPA) has emerged as a prominent first-principles method in material science, particularly to study the adsorption and chemisorption of small molecules on surfaces. However, its widespread application is hampered by its relatively high computational cost. Here, we present a well-parallelised implementation of the RPA with localised atomic orbitals and pair-atomic density fitting, which is especially suitable for studying two-dimensional systems. Through a dual $\textbf{k}$-grid scheme, we achieve fast and reliable convergence of RPA correlation energies to the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate the efficacy of our implementation through an application to the adsorption of CO on MgO(001) using PBE input orbitals (RPA@PBE) Our calculated adsorption energy is in good agreement with previously published RPA@PBE studies, but, as expected, overestimates the experimentally available adsorption energies as well as recent CCSD(T) results.</description>
