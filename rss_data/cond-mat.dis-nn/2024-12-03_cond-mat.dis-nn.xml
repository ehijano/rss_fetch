      <title>The Accuracy and Performance Analysis of the 1/t Wang-Landau Algorithm in the Joint Density of States Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1/t Wang-Landau algorithm is analyzed from the viewpoint of execution time and accuracy when it is used in computations of the density of states of a two-dimensional Ising model. We find that the simulation results have a systematic error, the magnitude of which decreases with increasing the lattice size. The relative error has two maxima: the first one is located near the energy of the ground state, and the second maximum corresponds to the value of the internal energy at the critical point. We demonstrate that it is impossible to estimate the execution time of the 1/t Wang-Landau algorithm in advance when simulating large lattices. The reason is that the criterion for switching to the 1/t mode was not met when the final value of the modification factor was reached. The simultaneous calculations of the density of states for energy and magnetization are shown to lead to higher accuracy in estimating statistical moments of internal energy.</description>

      <title>Simplified derivations for high-dimensional convex learning problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical physics provides tools for analyzing high-dimensional problems in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience. These calculations, particularly those using the replica method, often involve lengthy derivations that can obscure physical interpretation. We give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. Specifically, we introduce a cavity approach to analyzing high-dimensional learning problems and apply it to three cases: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure -- a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables -- enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a na\"ive method. These results match those obtained through the replica method.</description>

      <title>Universal Spreading Dynamics in Quasiperiodic Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive type of wave propagation, due to the intricate interplay of non-Hermiticity and disorder. Here, we investigate the spreading dynamics in the archetypal non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model with quasiperiodic disorder. We uncover counter-intuitive transport behaviors: subdiffusion with a spreading exponent $\delta=1/3$ in the localized regime and diffusion with $\delta=1/2$ in the delocalized regime, in stark contrast to their Hermitian counterparts (halted vs. ballistic). We then establish a unified framework from random-variable perspective to determine the universal scaling relations in both regimes for generic disordered non-Hermitian systems. An efficient method is presented to extract the spreading exponents from Lyapunov exponents. The observed subdiffusive or diffusive transport in our model stems from Van Hove singularities at the tail of imaginary density of states, as corroborated by Lyapunov-exponent analysis.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in liquid metals is directed by competing collective modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-diffusion process in a dense liquid is influenced by collective particle movements. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations for liquid aluminium and rubidium evidence a crossover in the diffusion coefficient at about $1.4$ times the melting temperature $T_m$, indicating a profound change in the diffusion mechanism. The corresponding velocity auto-correlation functions demonstrate a decrease of the cage effect with a gradual set-in of a power-law decay, the celebrate {\it long time tail}. This behavior is caused by a competition of density fluctuations near the melting point with vortex-type particle patterns from transverse currents in the hot fluid. The investigation of the velocity autocorrelation function evidences a gradual transition in dynamics with rising temperature. The competition between these two collective particle movements, one hindering and one enhancing the diffusion process, leads to a non-Arrhenius-type behavior of the diffusion coefficient around $1.4~T_m$, which signals the transition from a dense to a fluid-like liquid dynamics in the potential energy landscape picture.</description>

      <title>Differential learning kinetics govern the transition from memorization to generalization during in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative rates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent flow in inhomogeneous superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the supercurrent flow pattern is altered by inhomogeneities in superconducting films. Working in the vicinity of the critical temperature and assuming a model of short-range disorder in the quadratic term of the Ginzburg-Landau functional, we develop a perturbation theory in the inhomogeneity strength. Absorbing the ultraviolet divergences into the renormalization of the critical temperature, we arrive at a well-defined theory governed by large-scale physics. In the presence of inhomogeneities, the correlation functions of the order parameter and supercurrent exhibit a long-range power-law behavior, which can be attributed to the mixing of the amplitude and phase modes. The fluctuation magnitude grows with increasing the average current, and the system becomes strongly inhomogeneous near the critical current.</description>

      <title>Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Implications for Fragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Extending the atomic decomposition and many-body representation, a chemistry-motivated monomer-centered approach for machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most widely used machine learned (ML) potentials for condensed phase applications rely on many-body permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) or atom-centered neural networks (NN). However, these approaches often lack chemical interpretability in atomistic energy decomposition and the computational efficiency of traditional force fields has not been fully achieved. Here, we present a novel method that combines aspects of both approaches, and achieves state-of-the-art balance of accuracy and force field-level speed. This method utilizes a monomer-centered representation, where the potential energy is decomposed into the sum of chemically meaningful monomeric energies. Without sophisticated neural network design, the structural descriptors of monomers are described by 1-body and 2-body effective interactions, enforced by appropriate sets of PIPs as inputs to the feed forward NN. We demonstrate the performance of this method through systematic assessments of models for gas-phase water trimer, liquid water, and also liquid CO2. The high accuracy, fast speed, and flexibility of this method provide a new route for constructing accurate ML potentials and enabling large-scale quantum and classical simulations for complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Solving and visualizing fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions with neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an attention-based fermionic neural network (FNN) to variationally solve the problem of two-dimensional Coulomb electron gas in magnetic fields, a canonical platform for fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids, Wigner crystals and other unconventional electron states. Working directly with the full Hilbert space of $N$ electrons confined to a disk, our FNN consistently attains energies lower than LL-projected exact diagonalization (ED) and learns the ground state wavefunction to high accuracy. In low LL mixing regime, our FNN reveals microscopic features in the short-distance behavior of FQH wavefunction beyond the Laughlin ansatz. For moderate and strong LL mixing parameters, the FNN outperforms ED significantly. Moreover, a phase transition from FQH liquid to a crystal state is found at strong LL mixing. Our study demonstrates unprecedented power and universality of FNN based variational method for solving strong-coupling many-body problems with topological order and electron fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Brownian spin-locking effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian systems are characterized by spatiotemporal disorder, which arises from the erratic motion of particles driven by thermal fluctuations. When light interacts with such systems, it typically produces unpolarized and uncorrelated fields. Here, we report the observation of a large-scale spin-locking effect of light within a Brownian medium. In an observation direction perpendicular to the incident wave momentum, scattering naturally divides into two diffusion regions, each associated with an opposite spin from the Brownian nanoparticles. This effect arises from the intrinsic spin-orbit interactions of scattering from individual nanoparticles, which ubiquitously generate radiative spin fields that propagate through the Brownian medium with multiple incoherent scattering. It offers a novel experimental platform for exploring macroscale spin behaviors of diffused light, with potential applications in precision metrology for measuring various nanoparticle properties. Our findings may inspire the study of analogous phenomena for different waves from novel spin-orbit interactions in complex disordered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the phase diagram of a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model where the couplings are forced to thermalize at different times scales. Besides being a challenging generalization of the SK model, such settings may arise naturally in physics whenever part of the many degrees of freedom of a system relaxes to equilibrium considerably faster than the others. For this model we compute the asymptotic value of the second moment of the overlap distribution. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous sufficient condition for an annealed solution to hold, identifying a high temperature region. In addition, we also prove that for sufficiently low temperature the solution must present a number of replica symmetry breaking levels at least equal to the number of time scales already present in the multiscale model. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of gaps in the support of the functional order parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synaptic plasticity dynamically shapes the connectivity of neural systems and is key to learning processes in the brain. To what extent the mechanisms of plasticity can be exploited to drive a neural network and make it perform some kind of computational task remains unclear. This question, relevant in a bioengineering context, can be formulated as a control problem on a high-dimensional system with strongly constrained and non-linear dynamics. We present a self-contained procedure which, through appropriate spatio-temporal stimulations of the neurons, is able to drive rate-based neural networks with arbitrary initial connectivity towards a desired functional state. We illustrate our approach on two different computational tasks: a non-linear association between multiple input stimulations and activity patterns (representing digit images), and the construction of a continuous attractor encoding a collective variable in a neural population. Our work thus provides a proof of principle for emerging paradigms of in vitro computation based on real neurons.</description>

Abstract: Marginal optima are minima or maxima of a function with many nearly flat directions. In settings with many competing optima, marginal ones tend to attract algorithms and physical dynamics. Often, the important family of marginal attractors are a vanishing minority compared with nonmarginal optima and other unstable stationary points. We introduce a generic technique for conditioning the statistics of stationary points in random landscapes on their marginality, and apply it in three isotropic settings with qualitatively different structure: in the spherical spin-glasses, where the energy is Gaussian and its Hessian is GOE; in multispherical spin glasses, which are Gaussian but non-GOE; and in sums of squared spherical random functions, which are non-Gaussian. In these problems we are able to fully characterize the distribution of marginal optima in the landscape, including when they are in the minority.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To determine the precise link between anatomical structure and function, brain studies primarily concentrate on the anatomical wiring of the brain and its topological properties. In this work, we investigate the weighted degree and connection length distributions of the KKI-113 and KKI-18 human connectomes, the fruit fly, and of the mouse retina. We found that the node strength (weighted degree) distribution behavior differs depending on the considered scale. On the global scale, the distributions are found to follow a power-law behavior, with a roughly universal exponent close to 3. However, this behavior breaks at the local scale as the node strength distributions of the KKI-18 follow a stretched exponential, and the fly and mouse retina follow the lognormal distribution, respectively which are indicative of underlying random multiplicative processes and underpins non-locality of learning in a brain close to the critical state. However, for the case of the KKI-113 and the H01 human (1mm$^3$) datasets, the local weighted degree distributions follow an exponentially truncated power-law, which may hint at the fact that the critical learning mechanism may have manifested at the node level too.</description>

      <title>Investigating Stark MBL with Continuous Unitary Transformation Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ergodicity-to-localization transition in interacting fermion systems subjected to a spatially uniform electric field. For that we employ the recently proposed Tensorflow Equations (TFE), a type of continuous unitary flow equations. This enables us to iteratively determine an approximate diagonal basis of the quantum many-body system. We present improvements to the method, which achieves good accuracy at small to intermediate interaction strengths, even in the absence of an electric field or disorder. Then, we examine two quantities that reveal the fate of Stark MBL in 1D and 2D. First, we investigate the structure of the resulting basis to determine the crossover between ergodic and localized regimes with respect to electric field strength. Second, we simulate long-time dynamics at infinite temperature. Our results in 1D show a localization transition at non-zero field for finite interaction that vanishes with increasing system size leading to localization at infinitesimally small field even in the presence of interactions. In 2D we find less clear signatures of localization and strong finite size effects. We establish that the TFE work accurately up to intermediate times but cannot capture higher order effects in interaction strength that lead to delocalization at longer times in finite-size Stark MBL systems.</description>

      <title>Liquid Hopfield model: retrieval and localization in multicomponent liquid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18853v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological mixtures, such as the cellular cytoplasm, are composed of a large number of different components. From this heterogeneity, ordered mesoscopic structures emerge, such as liquid phases with controlled composition. These structures compete with each other for the same components. This raises several questions, such as what types of interactions allow the retrieval of multiple ordered mesoscopic structures, and what are the physical limitations for the retrieval of said structures. In this work, we develop an analytically tractable model for liquids capable of retrieving states with target compositions. We name this model the liquid Hopfield model in reference to corresponding work in the theory of associative neural networks. By solving this model, we show that non-linear repulsive interactions are necessary for retrieval of target structures. We demonstrate that this is because liquid mixtures at low temperatures tend to transition to phases with few components, a phenomenon that we term localization. Taken together, our results demonstrate a trade-off between retrieval and localization phenomena in liquid mixtures.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Inverse Design of Hyperuniform Optical Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we employ multiscale physics-informed neural networks (MscalePINNs) for the inverse design of finite-size photonic materials with stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) disordered geometries. Specifically, we show that MscalePINNs can capture the fast spatial variations of complex fields scattered by arrays of dielectric nanocylinders arranged according to isotropic SHU point patterns, thus enabling a systematic methodology to inversely retrieve their effective dielectric profiles. Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we numerically corroborate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. The flexible multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of more general effective media and finite-size optical metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.</description>

      <title>Nonequilbrium physics of generative diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models apply the concept of Langevin dynamics in physics to machine leaning, attracting a lot of interests from engineering, statistics and physics, but a complete picture about inherent mechanisms is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a transparent physics analysis of diffusion models, formulating the fluctuation theorem, entropy production, equilibrium measure, and Franz-Parisi potential to understand the dynamic process and intrinsic phase transitions. Our analysis is rooted in a path integral representation of both forward and backward dynamics, and in treating the reverse diffusion generative process as a statistical inference, where the time-dependent state variables serve as quenched disorder akin to that in spin glass theory. Our study thus links stochastic thermodynamics, statistical inference and geometry based analysis together to yield a coherent picture about how the generative diffusion models work.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization from interface reflections in a conductor with charge current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that a high-quality flat interface or boundary may act as a long-range skew scatterer for charged quasiparticles in a metal. In the presence of electric current parallel to the interface the number of clockwise and anti-clockwise reflections from the interface are no longer compensated. This results in a net orbital magnetization that can be observed by magneto-electric Kerr effect in a vicinity of the mean free path from the edge. The value of effective magnetization is given by the product of charge current density and the electron mean free path. Unlike orbital Hall or orbital Edelstein effects the proposed phenomenon does not require inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk of the sample.</description>
