      <title>Isotropic Equivalence of STVG--MOG and $\Lambda$CDM and Its Breakdown in Large--Scale Anisotropic Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $\sigma_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $\Lambda$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Physically-motivated priors in the local distance ladder significantly reduce the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determinations of the Hubble constant based on the local distance ladder remain in significant tension with early-Universe inferences from the cosmic microwave background. While this tension is often discussed in terms of new physics or unmodeled systematics, the role of the assumed priors on the model parameters has received comparatively little attention. Recently, Desmond et al. (2025) pointed out that the commonly adopted flat prior on distance moduli upweights smaller distances and systematically favors high inferred values of the Hubble constant. Motivated by this observation, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian recalibration of the distance ladder, applying physically motivated priors uniformly to all distances, including the Milky Way Cepheids, which are incorporated directly into the joint fit. Together with a conservative treatment of the Gaia EDR3 residual parallax offset, the Hubble constant shifts from $H_0 = 73.0 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ to $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, reducing the Hubble tension from $5 \, \sigma$ to $2 \, \sigma$. Our results show that the assumed priors -- often treated as innocuous defaults -- may play a central role in the Hubble tension. Because all local distance ladders rely on the calibration of distances, similar prior-driven effects are expected to arise across distance-ladder methods.</description>

      <title>The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project I: An Improved Determination of the Primordial Helium Abundance -- Project Description, Sample Selection, Observations, and Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely low metallicity HII regions have been observed with the goal of determining the primordial helium abundance ($Y_{\rm p}$). $Y_{\rm p}$, combined with standard big bang nucleosynthesis and the half-life of the neutron, provides a direct measurement of the number of neutrino families, but $Y_{\rm p}$ must be measured very precisely to provide meaningful constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model. Here we describe a program to combine new Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) observations with a new analysis methodology to significantly improve the determination of $Y_{\rm p}$. The LBT, with its MODS and LUCI instruments, produces spectra, which, when combined with our new analysis methodology, are capable of delivering He abundances in individual HII regions with uncertainties of approximately 2% or less. Archival LBT/MODS spectra of standard stars over a four-year period enable the determination of a wavelength-dependent uncertainty in the MODS spectral response, resulting in improved relative emission line uncertainties. An optimized sample of low-metallicity galaxies has been selected with the goal of producing a determination of $Y_{\rm p}$ with a precision of $\sim$ 0.5%, sufficient to provide an independent constraint on the effective number of neutrino families of $\sim$ 3%.</description>

      <title>The LBT Y$_\mathrm{p}$ Project IV: A New Value of the Primordial Helium Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new determination of the primordial helium abundance based on new, high-quality Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) observations of 54 metal-poor H II regions. These regions have been observed and analyzed uniformly. We also describe a number of updates to our methodology, including updated helium emissivities. Enabled by the large, high-quality dataset, we examine our sample targets for potential systematic errors, which could bias their results. We perform a standard 95% confidence level $\chi^2$ cut and find that a significantly larger fraction (47/54 = 87%) of our sample qualifies than for previous datasets. We also screen for quality and reliability, flagging targets which may introduce significant systematic errors, producing a dataset of 41 targets. In a significant breakthrough for the field, that dataset includes 15 high SNR targets with low metallicity (O/H &lt; 4 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$). Due to this low-metallicity dataset, for the first time, a weighted average for determining the primordial helium abundance (Y$_\mathrm{p}$) is well-justified and produces a robust result. By weighted average of our 15 low-metallicity targets, we determine Y$_\mathrm{p}$ = 0.2458 $\pm$ 0.0013. This result achieves an unprecedented precision of 0.5%, and it is in good agreement with the BBN result, Y$_\mathrm{p}$ = 0.2467 $\pm$ 0.0002, based on the Planck determination of the baryon density.</description>

      <title>The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project V: Cosmological Implications of a New Determination of Primordial $^4$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primordial abundance of $^4$He plays a central role in big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project's new measurement of the primordial $^4$He mass fraction $Y_{\rm p} =0.2458 \pm 0.0013$ is the most precise determination to date. In this paper, we combine our new $Y_{\rm p}$ value with the latest primordial deuterium measurement, and assess the consequences for cosmology. For Standard BBN, where the number of light neutrino species is fixed at $N_\nu=3$, the single free parameter is the cosmic baryon density; the CMB measures this independently, with results consistent with each other. Combining $Y_{\rm p}$ , D/H, BBN, and the CMB, gives the cosmic baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta = (6.120 \pm 0.038) \times 10^{-10}$, corresponding to a baryon density parameter $\Omega_{\rm B} h^2 = 0.02236 \pm 0.00014$. We then allow $N_\nu$ to vary and thus measure relativistic species present during nucleosynthesis. We find $\eta = (6.101 \pm 0.044) \times 10^{-10}$ or $\Omega_{\rm B} h^2= 0.02229 \pm 0. 00016$, and $N_\nu = 2.925 \pm 0.082$, and for $N_\nu \ge 3$, $\Delta N_\nu= N_\nu-3 \le 0.125$ (95\% CL) during BBN and the CMB. Our results demonstrate consistency with the Standard Model of particle physics, and with the standard cosmology that links BBN at $\sim 1 \ \rm sec$ and the CMB at $\sim 400,000$ yr.</description>

      <title>Mapping dark matter in the Bullet Cluster using JWST imaging and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated gravitational lens model of the Bullet cluster (1E 0657-56) by combining JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopy. Although previous lens models relied on many multiply imaged galaxies, only six systems had spectroscopic redshifts prior to this work. Our lens model is constrained by a catalogue of 135 secure multiple images from 27 background galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, uniformly covering both subclusters and a wide redshift range of 0.9 - 6.7. We also provide a catalogue of 199 multiple image candidates. We model the cluster with Lenstool and incorporate several large-scale haloes, cluster members, the intracluster gas, and group-scale haloes surrounding the cluster core, motivated by spectroscopic studies of cluster member kinematics. We describe the main cluster component with a complex, elongated double-peaked distribution, and the subcluster with a single large-scale halo aligning closely with the brightest cluster galaxy ($4_{-2}^{+4}$ kpc). The uncertainty of the alignment is improved threefold with the addition of JWST systems. The addition of group-scale substructures, roughly following the two axes of cluster assembly, improves the fit to the multiple image positions and provides a physically motivated alternative to constant shear. Our lens model shows the closest agreement with previous studies in aperture mass profiles at $\sim60$ kpc from the BCGs, but exhibits significant differences in the detailed mass distribution as a result of different lens-modelling strategies and adopted constraints. The differences are reflected in small but spatially coherent deviations between the new spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts predicted by earlier lens models.</description>

      <title>Tensions in Cosmology: Interpreting Them Through Inhomogeneous Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review a subset of the current tensions affecting the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, emphasizing the role of chronic systematics and significance inflation in shaping their interpretation. As a unifying framework, we consider the spherically symmetric inhomogeneous $\Lambda$LTB model and use it as a set of "glasses" through which to reinterpret the Hubble, dipole, and dark-energy tensions. Large-scale spatial gradients in this model introduce anisotropic expansion and position-dependent observables, allowing local estimates of $H_{0}$ to shift, dipolar signatures to arise, and an apparently evolving dark-energy equation of state to be mimicked without invoking genuinely dynamical dark energy. We discuss how these effects are constrained once the full supernova, CMB, and large-scale-structure data sets are included, and argue that it remains unclear whether any single $\Lambda$LTB configuration can simultaneously account for all major anomalies. More broadly, we highlight that cosmology currently lacks a widely accepted baseline model that is both theoretically well founded and capable of accommodating the Hubble and dark-energy tensions, leaving us without a true concordance framework for forecasting future surveys.</description>

      <title>How isotropic is dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensions in late-time expansion data have renewed interest in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We ask: \emph{how isotropic must dark energy be?} Working in Bianchi~I, we allow time-dependent anisotropic stress and introduce a parameterisation that enforces a vanishing line-of-sight integral of the shear, thereby satisfying the CMB ISW quadrupole bound by construction. Using Pantheon+SH0ES SNe together with DESI BAO distances, single-bin (constant) and five-bin anisotropic models improve the fit over $w$CDM by $\Delta(-2\ln L_{\rm iso})=14.8$ and $26.6$ respectively, but both violate the quadrupole constraint. In contrast, a five-bin constrained model achieves $\Delta(-2\ln L_{\rm iso})=15.4$ while remaining compatible with the quadrupole limit. The fit improvement arises from two sources: capturing directional structure in the Pantheon+ SNe data, and partially alleviating the tension between the SH0ES $H_0$ value and DESI BAO distances.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the nature of dark matter by mapping cosmic filaments from Lyman-alpha emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model predicts that cosmic filaments are highly clumpy, whereas warm dark matter -- invoked to address small-scale challenges in $\Lambda$CDM -- produces filaments that are noticeably smoother and less structured. In this work, we investigate the potential of Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission to trace cosmic filaments at redshifts $z=2.5$ and $z=4$, and assess their potential for constraining the nature of dark matter. Our analysis shows that Ly$\alpha$ filaments provide a promising observational probe of dark matter: at $z=4$, differences in filament smoothness and surface brightness serve as distinctive signatures between models. Looking ahead, the upcoming generation of 30-meter class telescopes will be critical for enabling these measurements, offering a compelling opportunity to distinguish the nature of dark matter by mapping the structure of cosmic filaments.</description>

      <title>The Bondi universe: How negative mass drives the cosmological expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a new cosmological coincidence that parallels the well-known matter/dark-energy coincidence: the present-epoch transition of the universe from a weakly coupled (collisionless) to a strongly coupled (collisional) gravitational regime. Within a cosmological model containing equal amounts of positive and negative Bondi masses -- consistent with the weak equivalence principle and momentum conservation -- we show that this coupling transition naturally coincides with the shift from a coasting to an accelerating expansion. A linear response analysis of the corresponding Vlasov-Poisson system reveals that mixed positive-negative mass configurations are always unstable, with growth rates that increase at shorter wavelengths, thereby driving the system toward strong coupling. Using long-time, exact one-dimensional N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the universe undergoes three successive expansion phases: an initial ballistic regime, an intermediate random-walk acceleration driven by sporadic Bondi encounters, and finally a uniformly accelerating phase triggered by the formation of stable positive/negative mass pairs. The onset of this last phase occurs precisely when the coupling parameter crosses unity, linking the two cosmological coincidences through a single dynamical mechanism. These results suggest that cosmic acceleration may arise from the nonlinear dynamics of a gravitationally neutral mixed-mass universe, without invoking dark energy or a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Linear perturbation theory and structure formation in a Brans-Dicke theory of gravity without dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of the large-scale cosmic structure in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity belonging to the class of the Brans--Dicke theories. The universe contains baryonic matter alone and neither dark matter nor dark energy. The two arbitrary functions of the scalar field characterizing the kinetic term and the self-interaction potential are set to $W(\varphi)=-1$ and $V(\varphi) = -\Xi \varphi$, respectively, with $\Xi$ a positive constant. In the weak-field limit, the theory reduces to Refracted Gravity, a non-relativistic theory whose modified Poisson equation contains the scalar field $\varphi$ that provides the gravitational boost required to describe the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters without dark matter. In a flat, matter-dominated, homogeneous and isotropic universe the same scalar field $\varphi$ drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and describes the observed redshift evolution of the Hubble-Lema\^itre parameter $H(z)$. However, in the equation of the growth factor of the linear perturbation theory, the form of $V(\varphi)$ makes the coefficient of the source of the gravitational field proportional to $H^{-1}(z)$; therefore the gravitational field is strongly suppressed at early times and structure formation is delayed to redshift $z&lt; 1$, in disagreement with the observation of formed galaxies at much larger redshifts. In addition, the form of $W(\varphi)$ and a linear $V(\varphi)$ imply that $\varphi$ generates twice the gravitational boost on massive particles than on photons, with possible observable consequences on the gravitational lensing phenomenon. It remains to be investigated whether different choices of $W(\varphi)$ and $V(\varphi)$, that can still make the theory reduce to Refracted Gravity in the weak-field limit, might alleviate these problems.</description>

      <title>Seeds of supermassive black holes in general relativistic and alternative cosmologies: Implications of massive seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with mass $(10^{6}-10^{9}) M_{\odot}$ at $z = 10$ has been recently revealed by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. In this study we generate seeds for the above range of SMBHs in various background cosmologies. We consider cosmic timescales required for black hole growth provided by three general relativistic cosmological models ($\Lambda$CDM, $\omega$CDM and Dynamical Dark Energy(DDE) and the braneworld cosmology. The growth of SMBHs is studied through Eddington limited and super-Eddington accretion, where the accretion starts at z=30. It is found that growth of SMBHs by z=10 within Eddington limited accretion is possible through massive seeds $(M\geq10^{4}M_{\odot})$ in all cosmologies. Super Eddington accretion onto spinning black holes with mass of few tens of solar masses can result in SMBHs by z=10 in all cosmologies. The viable cosmologies considered here are found to be unable to strongly distinguish between the seed black hole masses. The seeds generated in this work are assumed to be of primordial origin in order to satisfy the criteria of formation of high redshift massive galaxies. The fraction of primordial black holes (PBHs) contributing to dark matter ($f_{PBH}$) and their corresponding number densities for the mass range ($10^{5}-10^{8}$) $M_{\odot}$ are calculated in both seed effect and Poisson effect. In seed effect, PBHs of mass $\geq 10^{7} M_{\odot}$ contributes $\leq 10^{-2}$ to the dark matter fraction. The evolution of gas mass inside a PBH seeded dark matter halo is studied. The ratio of black hole to stellar mass is also evaluated for star formation efficiency in the range (0.1-1) and found to be ($10^{-3}-1$) for $M_{BH}=10^{8} M_{\odot}$ and ($10^{-2}-10$) for $M_{BH}=10^{9} M_{\odot}$.</description>

Abstract: Inflationary perturbations are quantum in origin. Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Axions on a Hyperbolic Ride: Geometric Suppression of CMB Isocurvature and a Blue-Tilted Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CMB limits on cold-dark-matter isocurvature are often interpreted as excluding the simultaneous realization of high-scale inflation and large QCD axion decay constants in pre-inflationary Peccei--Quinn (PQ) scenarios. We show that this conclusion can be evaded by exploiting \emph{field-space geometry}. For a minimal complex PQ scalar with a $U(1)$-symmetric potential and nonlinear sigma-model kinetic term $d\sigma^{2}=dR^{2}+f^{2}(R)\,d\theta^{2}$, a curved target-space metric endows the axion fluctuation with a time-dependent geometric mass during inflation, suppressing isocurvature without explicit PQ breaking and without extreme radial displacements. Specializing to a hyperbolic metric $f(R)=L\sinh(R/L)$ with curvature scale $L$, we find that for $R\gtrsim L$ the canonically normalized angular mode can be generically $\mathcal{O}(H_{\rm inf})$-heavy during radial slow-roll, dynamically damping CMB-scale fluctuations while producing a characteristic blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum. As a result, inflationary Hubble scales as large as $H_{\rm inf}\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ can be compatible with $f_a\sim 10^{14}$--$10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, reopening parameter space usually regarded as excluded. We present numerical benchmarks and a semi-analytic template that relates the scale-dependence of isocurvature to the geometric lever arm $R/L$, providing a direct phenomenological probe on PQ field-space geometry.</description>

      <title>Observational Implications of Cosmic Ray-Inverse Compton 'Boosted' Cool Cores in Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\rm radio}-L_{\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\rm cav}-L_{\rm X,cool}-L_{\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$.</description>

      <title>The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project II: MODS Spectra, Physical Conditions, and Oxygen Abundances in Local Metal-Poor Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirically measuring the primordial He mass fraction, $Y_{\rm p}$, requires a significant number of low-metallicity nebulae with direct constraints on He/H and O/H abundances. This technique requires high-fidelity measurements of the gas-phase physical conditions, namely the electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$). To this end, we present deep rest-optical spectroscopy for a sample of 62 low-metallicity ($\lesssim$ 20% solar O/H) galaxies acquired using the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) as part of the LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project. We discuss new fitting methods that recover the intensity of up to 61 H and He recombination lines, of which, up to 26 will be used to determine gas-phase He abundances, and we examine the emission line properties of the LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project sample. We assess different scaling relations in the low-metallicity interstellar medium (ISM), finding that $n_e$[Ar IV] measured in 31 targets is systematically larger than $n_e$[S II] or $n_e$[O II]. The larger densities are insufficient to significantly bias $T_e$[O III] or the O/H abundance. $T_e$[S III] and $T_e$[O III] are strongly correlated over a range of $\sim$10$^4$ K with very low scatter, and we calibrate new $T_e$[S III]-$T_e$[O III] scaling relations for use in other low-metallicity environments. We examine different $T_e$ measured in the low-ionization gas, finding significant scatter compared to $T_e$[O III]. The precision direct O/H derived in this analysis (median uncertainty $\sim$4%) are consistent with prior literature measurements, albeit with relatively large scatter. These data provide a key component necessary to empirically measure $Y_{\rm p}$ and the abundance patterns of other elements in the ISM.</description>

      <title>The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project III: LUCI Spectra of Metal-Poor Nebulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately determining the elemental abundances of a low metallicity nebula strongly depends on measuring the density (n$_e$) and temperature (T$_e$) of the gas. Because these two parameters are inherently degenerate when derived solely from H and He recombination lines, we rely on the density-sensitive HeI $\lambda$10830 line to assist in resolving this issue, especially for accurate He abundances. To facilitate this, we present near-IR (NIR) LUCI spectra of 48 low-metallicity targets from the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and homogeneously reduce them using Pypeit as part of the LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project. IR spectra require special care, and we wavelength calibrate by-hand using the bright OH emission lines, carefully apply proper telluric corrections, and co-add the spectra of LUCI1 and LUCI2 on a resampled grid to ensure accurate results. We use a Gaussian profile to fit the emission lines and measure the fluxes relative to Paschen-gamma (P$\gamma$), resulting in HeI $\lambda$10830 to P$\gamma$ ratios consistent with previous studies. As a result, this work significantly expands the available dataset of NIR HeI $\lambda$10830 fluxes in low metallicity galaxies. These high-quality measurements, where we find a median flux ratio uncertainty of $\widetilde{\sigma} = 0.08$, reduce the overall uncertainties in helium abundance estimates for individual targets. The increased size of the high-quality sample enables searching for systematic uncertainties and improves the reliability of the helium abundance determinations used to infer the primordial helium abundance ($Y_{\rm p}$).</description>

      <title>X-Ray Analysis of an Off-Axis Merger Stage Binary Galaxy Cluster: PSZ2 G279.79+39.09</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an X-ray analysis of the merging galaxy cluster system PSZ2 G279.79+39.09 ($z=0.29$) using archival XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. The surface brightness image is bimodal, elongated east-west with a projected core separation of $\sim 1.35$ Mpc. We measure gas temperatures of 5.36 keV for the eastern subcluster (PSZ-E) and 5.44 keV for the western component (PSZ-W). Assuming isothermal intracluster gas, the hydrostatic masses are $\log(M_{500}/M_\odot)=14.76$ for PSZ-E and 14.54 for PSZ-W, implying a mass ratio of $\sim 1:1.7$. PSZ-E shows X-ray concentration indices of $c_{40}/c_{400}=0.124$ and $c_{100}/c_{500}=0.278$, together with a centroid shift of $w=0.016$, indicating a disturbed halo that still hosts a compact cool core; PSZ-W is comparably disturbed even in its core. Both subclusters exhibit ICM asymmetries consistent with ram-pressure stripping, and PSZ-W displays an X-ray tail extending nearly to the outskirts of PSZ-E. The orientation and length of this tail support an off-axis merger geometry. Thermodynamic maps reveal a hot ($\sim 7.3$ keV), high-pressure, high-entropy bridge between the cores. From the Rankine-Hugoniot temperature jump, we infer a Mach number $M=1.41^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$, consistent with a weak merger shock propagating at $1620^{+500}_{-420}$ km s$^{-1}$. These results indicate a merger with a non-zero impact parameter, likely observed near core passage ($\lesssim 0.5$ Gyr before or after), with the pre-pericenter scenario slightly preferred based on the projected separation and thermodynamic structure.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Corrections to Scalar Field Effective Action in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-loop effective action for a test scalar field in a general Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background, specifically focusing on quantum corrections up to the second order in the interaction strength. By employing the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we derive the equation of motion for the field expectation value, which incorporates not only the standard local radiative corrections but also novel nonlocal features: a memory term and a stochastic noise term. We identify all ultraviolet divergent structures within these nonlocal terms and provide a consistent renormalization procedure. To analyze the physical impact of these terms, we apply a local approximation under the assumption of slowly-varying fields, by which the memory term acts as a negative contribution to the drift coefficient. As a concrete application, we consider a massive $\phi^4$ theory and show that these one-loop corrections lead to a suppression of the field variance in the infrared regime compared to the tree-level results.</description>

Abstract: Fisher-matrix forecasts are presented for the cosmological surveys of the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) and the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). The wide, low-redshift coverage of J-PAS and the high-density, high-redshift mapping of PFS are strongly complementary: combining the two reduces marginalized uncertainties on all primary parameters compared with either survey individually. Adding the joint J-PAS+PFS data to next-generation CMB measurements from the Simons Observatory (SO) and \textsc{LiteBird} yields an expected precision of $\sigma(\sum m_\nu)=0.017\,$eV in the $\Lambda$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ framework, sufficient to disfavour the inverted neutrino hierarchy at $2.34\,\sigma$ if the true mass sum equals the normal-ordering minimum. Motivated by recent DESI results, we also forecast within a $w_0w_a$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ cosmology, adopting the DESI\,DR2 best-fit values ($w_0=-0.758$, $w_a=-0.82$) as fiducial. The combination CMB+J-PAS+PFS then delivers $\sigma(w_0)=0.044$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.18$, corresponding to a $5.1\,\sigma$ preference for a time-varying dark-energy equation of state. These findings show that J-PAS and PFS, especially when coupled with Stage-IV CMB observations, will provide competitive tests of neutrino physics and the dynamics of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Non-Separable Halo Bias from High-Redshift Galaxy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The halo model provides a powerful framework for interpreting galaxy clustering by linking the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes to the underlying matter distribution. A key assumption within the halo bias approximation of the halo model is that, on sufficiently large scales, the halo bias between two halo populations is a separable function of the mass of each population. In this work, we test the validity of this approximation on quasi-linear scales using both simulations and observational data across a broad range of halo masses and redshifts. In particular, we define a separability function based on halo or galaxy cross-correlations to quantify deviations from halo bias separability, and measure it from N-body simulations. We find significant departures from separability on quasi-linear scales (\(\sim 1\text{--}5\,\mathrm{Mpc}\)) at high redshifts (\(z \geq 3\)), leading to a suppression in the scale-dependent halo bias and hence in halo cross-correlations by up to a factor of 2 -- or even higher. In contrast, deviations at low redshifts remain modest. Additionally, using high-redshift (\(z \sim 3.6\)) galaxy samples, we detect deviations from bias separability that closely align with simulation predictions. The breakdown of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear scales at high redshifts underscore the importance to account for non-separability in models of the galaxy-halo connection in this regime. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of high-redshift galaxy cross-correlations as a probe for improving the galaxy-halo connection from upcoming large-scale surveys.</description>

      <title>The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure for Mixed Dark Matter Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of the perturbative nonlinear dynamics of cosmological fluctuations in dark sectors comprising a fraction of non-cold dark matter, for example ultra-light axions or light thermal relics. These mixed dark matter scenarios exhibit suppressed growth of perturbations below a characteristic, cosmologically relevant, scale associated with the microscopic nature of the non-cold species. As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear solutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not, in general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark matter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound speed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible and devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the evaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe mixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a first application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the energy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Our refined theoretical modeling leads to somewhat weaker bounds compared to previous analyses.</description>

      <title>Phantom crossing or dark interaction?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from DESI BAO measurements, together with Planck CMB and Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\rm de}&lt;-1$) in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$ is used to fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but effective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$. The energy flows from dark matter to dark energy at early times and reverses at later times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, despite its success, is challenged by persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($S_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide significantly better fits to the data than $\Lambda$CDM. Although indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark sector interaction at $z \approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially alleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \lesssim 0.8$, which is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.</description>

      <title>An improved model for the effect of correlated Si-III absorption on the one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of Si III absorption and its effect on the 1D Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum using the Sherwood-Relics hydrodynamical simulation suite. In addition to oscillations from the Ly$\alpha$--Si III cross correlation that are damped toward smaller scales, we find an enhancement in small-scale power that has been ignored in previous studies. We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\alpha$ and Si III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\alpha$ and Si III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si III power spectrum and Ly$\alpha$--Si III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\lesssim 3.5$. The fitting function is validated by comparison against multiple simulated datasets at redshifts $2.2\leq z \leq 5.0$ and wavenumbers $k &lt; 0.2\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$. Our model has little effect on existing warm dark matter constraints from the Ly$\alpha$ forest when adopting a physically motivated prior on the silicon abundance. It will, however, be an essential consideration for future, high precision Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum measurements.</description>

      <title>Resistive Scaling in the Magnetic Helicity-Driven Inverse Cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse cascade in MHD turbulence plays a crucial role in various astrophysical processes such as galaxy cluster formation, solar and stellar dynamo mechanisms, and the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in the early universe. A standard numerical approach involves injecting magnetic helicity at intermediate length scales to generate a secondary, time-dependent spectral peak that gradually propagates toward larger scales. Previous simulations have already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density $\epsilon_\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have $E_\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\mathrm{H} \epsilon_\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where $C_\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient analogous to the Kolmogorov constant. We present a summary of the 25 distinct simulations conducted with the \textsc{Pencil Code}, systematically varying the forcing wavenumber $k_\mathrm{f}$, magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$, grid resolution $N^3$, and Lundquist number $Lu$. We obtained $C_\mathrm{H}$ and corresponding error bars by calculating the compensated spectrum and investigated its dependence with $Lu$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$. For the $C_\mathrm{H}$ - $Lu$ relationship, we observe strong correlations with power-law exponents of 1 and 2/3. In contrast, we find no significant correlation between $C_\mathrm{H}$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$.</description>

      <title>BICEP/Keck XX: Component-separated maps of polarized CMB and thermal dust emission using Planck and BICEP/Keck Observations through the 2018 Observing Season</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present component-separated polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Galactic thermal dust emission, derived using data from the BICEP/Keck experiments through the 2018 observing season and Planck. By employing a maximum-likelihood method that utilizes observing matrices, we produce unbiased maps of the CMB and dust signals. We outline the computational challenges and demonstrate an efficient implementation of the component map estimator. We show methods to compute and characterize power spectra of these maps, opening up an alternative way to infer the tensor-to-scalar ratio from our data. We compare the results of this map-based separation method with the baseline BICEP/Keck analysis. Our analysis demonstrates consistency between the two methods, finding an 84% correlation between the pipelines.</description>

      <title>Probing Primordial black holes with the distortion of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of numerous compact binary coalescences, serves as a powerful probe of both astrophysical populations and fundamental physics. In this work, we investigate the influence of gravitational lensing on the SGWB, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential lenses. Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation. Although the SGWB from binary black holes has not yet been observed, our analytical results provide theoretical insight into the possible imprint of lensing on its spectrum and suggest that future detections could offer a novel avenue to constrain dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lensing without mixing: Probing Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and other scale-dependent features in cosmic shear surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak-gravitational lensing tends to wash out scale and time-dependent features of the clustering of matter, such as the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) which appear in the form of wiggles in the matter power spectrum but that disappear in the analogous lensing $C_\ell$. This is a direct consequence of lensing being a projected effect. In this paper, we demonstrate how the noise complexity -- often deemed "erasing the signal" -- induced by a particular de-projection technique, the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform arXiv:1312.0430, can be used to extract the BAO signal and non-gaussian aperture-mass-like properties at chosen physical scales. We take into account parts of the data vectors that should effectively be without cosmological signature and also introduce an additional re-weighting designed to specifically highlight clustering features -- both at the probe (summary statistics) or map (amplitude of the field) level. We thus demonstrate why weak-gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure of the Universe, though only in a tomographic setting, does not erase scale and time-dependent features of the dynamics of matter, while providing a tool to effectively extract them from actual galaxy-shapes measurements.</description>

      <title>How well is the local Large Scale Structure of the Universe known? CosmicFlows vs. Biteau's Galaxy Catalog with Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge of the actual density distribution of matter in the local universe is needed for a variety of purposes -- for instance, as a baseline model for ultrahigh energy cosmic ray sources in the continuum limit and for predicting the diffuse Dark Matter annihilation signal. Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026). We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (|l| &lt; 30{\deg}, |b| &lt; 20{\deg}) as filled by Biteau using "cloning". Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where "galaxies" are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. The angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes not congruent with evidence in the galaxy catalog.</description>

      <title>A redshift survey of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 : No upturn of the faint-end slope of galaxy luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the galaxy luminosity function of cluster galaxies in the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 (A2199), focusing on the faint-end slope down to $M_r \sim -14.5$. To achieve this, we augment the existing dataset by adding redshift data from our deep MMT/Hectospec survey and from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), significantly improving the spectroscopic completeness down to $r_{\mathrm{petro},0} = 20.8$ within the central $30^\prime$ region. The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $\alpha = -1.23 \pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $\alpha \sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported. Instead, they indicate that environmental processes in dense cluster cores does not seem to trigger the formation or survival of low-mass galaxies, thereby preventing a steep faint-end upturn in the luminosity function.</description>

      <title>Zooming-in on cluster radio relics -- I. How density fluctuations explain the Mach number discrepancy, microgauss magnetic fields, and spectral index variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that radio relics are the result of synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. Current models, however, are still unable to explain several aspects of their formation. In this paper, we focus on three outstanding problems: i) Mach number estimates derived from radio data do not agree with those derived from X-ray data, ii) cooling length arguments imply a magnetic field that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM), and iii) spectral index variations do not agree with standard cooling models. To solve these problems, we first identify typical shock conditions in cosmological simulations, using the results to inform significantly higher resolution shock-tube simulations. We apply the cosmic ray electron spectra code CREST and the emission code CRAYON+ to these, thereby generating mock observables ab-initio. We identify that upon running into an accretion shock, merger shocks generate a shock-compressed sheet, which, in turn, runs into upstream density fluctuations in pressure equilibrium. This mechanism directly gives rise to solutions to the three problems: it creates a distribution of Mach numbers at the shock-front, which flattens cosmic ray electron spectra, thereby biasing radio-derived Mach number estimates to higher values. We show that this effect is particularly strong in weaker shocks. Secondly, the density sheet becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable at the contact discontinuity, causing turbulence and additional compression downstream. This amplifies the magnetic field from ICM-like conditions up to microgauss levels. We show that synchrotron-based measurements are strongly biased by the tail of the distribution here too. Finally, the same instability also breaks the common assumption that matter is advected at the post-shock velocity downstream, thus invalidating laminar-flow based cooling models.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave and electromagnetic detections in the context of the CosmoDC2 LSST synthetic catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We release CosmoDC2_BCO, a synthetic catalog of gravitational-wave events and electromagnetic counterparts associated with galaxies from CosmoDC2. The catalog provides intrinsic and extrinsic source parameters, signal-to-noise ratios, parameter uncertainties, sky localization areas, and kilonova apparent magnitudes in LSST filters. Our results show that third-generation detector networks substantially increase detection rates and improve parameter estimation. Second-generation detectors, when combined with third-generation ones, significantly enhance sky localization and distance precision, particularly for BNS mergers. Assuming a simplified Target of Opportunity strategy, we estimate that an LSST-like survey, partnered with the CE+ET+LVK network at 70% duty cycle, could detect about 5000 kilonovae with GW counterparts over a 10-year period on a 16000 deg^2 footprint, predominantly from low-mass BNS mergers that produce long-lived supermassive neutron star remnants. While this is a substantial number, it represents only a small fraction of the total neutron star mergers expected to be observed by third-generation networks. These projections rely on several simplifying assumptions-including the adopted merger rate, the kilonova luminosity distribution, and the configuration and scheduling of future surveys-which introduce notable uncertainties. Therefore, the estimated detection numbers should be interpreted with appropriate caution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent evidences of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) through Pulsar Time Array (PTA) observations hint towards an alternative inflationary scenario, compared to the usual inflation, for describing the early stage of the universe in order to be compatible with the PTA data. Moreover, currently the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO) refines the constraint on inflationary observables, compared to the only-Planck 2018 measurements. In the present work, we simultaneously address these two issues by incorporating certain modification during inflation over the usual inflationary scenario. Such modification amplifies the primordial tensor perturbation over the modes that are sensitive to the NANOGrav frequency region. For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where the entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy that is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for suitable representations. The constraints on the model parameters coming from the ACT data also fit the NANOGrav 15-year data (based on numerical analysis), which reveal the model's compatibility with both the ACT and the PTA data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity is a viable extension of General Relativity, however its strong-field predictions remain largely untested. Using the static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory, we confront it with the most stringent probes available: black-hole shadows, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements, S2-star precession, and strong gravitational lensing. We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case~I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case~II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr~A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients. These results provide the sharpest strong-field constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to date, and point toward future tests using next-generation horizon-scale imaging and precision Galactic-center astrometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for inflationary model building in the framework of metric-affine gravity. Such a mechanism involves an inflaton non-minimally coupled with the Holst invariant. If the non-minimal coupling function has a zero point and it is very steep at that same point, then the canonically normalized inflaton potential always features an exponential plateau, regardless of the shape of the original inflaton potential. The inflationary predictions in such a region are equivalent to the ones of Starobinsky inflation.</description>

Abstract: We discuss key aspects of the nature of radiation from global strings and its impact on the relic axion density. Using a simple model we demonstrate the dependence on the spectrum of radiation emitted by strings. We then study the radiation emitted by perturbed straight strings paying particular attention to the difference between the overall phase of the field and the small perturbations about the string solution which are the axions. We find that a significant correction is required to be sure that one is analyzing the axions and not the self-field of the string. Typically this requires one to excise a sizeable region around the string - something which is not usually done in the case of numerical field theory simulations of string networks. We have measured the spectrum of radiation from these strings and find that it is compatible with an exponential, as predicted by the Nambu-like Kalb-Ramond action, and in particular is not a ``hard'' spectrum often found in string network simulations. We conclude by attempting to assess the uncertainties on relic density and find that this leads to a range of possible axion masses when compared to the measured density from the Cosmic Microwave Background, albeit that they are typically higher than what is predicted by the Initial Misalignment Mechanism. If the decay is via a ``soft spectrum'' from loops produced close to the backreaction scale we find that $m_{\rm a}\approx 160\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and a detection frequency $f\approx 38\,{\rm GHz}$. If axions are emitted directly by the string network, and we use emission spectra reported in field theory simulations, then $m_{\rm a}\approx 4\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 1\,{\rm GHz}$, however this increases to $m_a \approx 125\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 30\,{\rm GHz}$ using our spectra for the case of an oscillating string. In all scenarios there are significant remaining uncertainties that we delineate.</description>
