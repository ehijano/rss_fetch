      <title>Metabolism, information, and viability in a simulated physically-plausible protocell</title>

Abstract: Critical experimental design issues connecting energy transduction and inheritable information within a protocell are explored and elucidated. The protocell design utilizes a photo-driven energy transducer (a ruthenium complex) to turn resource molecules into building blocks, in a manner that is modulated by a combinatorial DNA-based co-factor. This co-factor molecule serves as part of an electron relay for the energy transduction mechanism, where the charge-transport rates depend on the sequence that contains an oxo-guanine. The co-factor also acts as a store of inheritable information due to its ability to replicate non-enzymatically through template-directed ligation. Together, the energy transducer and the co-factor act as a metabolic catalyst that produces co-factor DNA building blocks as well as fatty acids (from picolinium ester and modified DNA oligomers), where the fatty acids self-assemble into vesicles on which exterior surface both the co-factor (DNA) and the energy transducer are anchored with hydrophobic tails. Here we use simulations to study how the co-factor sequence determines its fitness as reflected by charge transfer and replication rates. To estimate the impact on the protocell, we compare these rates with previously measured metabolic rates from a similar system where the charge transfer is directly between the ruthenium complex and the oxo-guanine (without DNA replication and charge transport). Replication and charge transport turn out to have different and often opposing sequence requirements. Functional information of the co-factor molecules is used to probe the feasibility of randomly picking co-factor sequences from a limited population of co-factors molecules, where a good co-factor can enhance both metabolic biomass production and its own replication rate.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Graph Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have emerged in very recent years as a powerful tool for supporting in silico Virtual Screening. In this work we present a GNN which uses Graph Convolutional architectures to achieve very accurate multi-target screening. We also devised a hierarchical Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique to catch information directly at atom, ring, and whole molecule level by leveraging the message passing mechanism. In this way, we find the most relevant moieties involved in bioactivity prediction. Results: We report a state-of-the-art GNN classifier on twenty Cyclin-dependent Kinase targets in support of VS. Our classifier outperforms previous SOTA approaches proposed by the authors. Moreover, a CDK1-only high-sensitivity version of the GNN has been designed to use our explainer in order to avoid the inherent bias of multi-class models. The hierarchical explainer has been validated by an expert chemist on 19 approved drugs on CDK1. Our explainer provided information in accordance to the docking analysis for 17 out of the 19 test drugs. Conclusion: Our approach is a valid support for shortening both the screening and the hit-to-lead phase. Detailed knowledge about the molecular substructures that play a role in the inhibitory action, can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the pharmacophoric function of the molecule also for repurposing purposes. Scientific Contribution Statement: The core scientific innovation of our work is the use of a hierarchical XAI approach on a GNN trained for a ligand-based VS task. The application of the hierarchical explainer allows for eliciting also structural information...</description>
