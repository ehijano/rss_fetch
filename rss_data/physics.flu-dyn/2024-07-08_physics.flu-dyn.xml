      <title>Topological Separation of Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortices and their analysis play a critical role in the understanding of complex phenomena in turbulent flows. Traditional vortex extraction methods, notably region-based techniques, often overlook the entanglement phenomenon, resulting in the inclusion of multiple vortices within a single extracted region. Their separation is necessary for quantifying different types of vortices and their statistics. In this study, we propose a novel vortex separation method that extends the conventional contour tree-based segmentation approach with an additional step termed "layering". Upon extracting a vortical region using specified vortex criteria (e.g., $\lambda_2$), we initially establish topological segmentation based on the contour tree, followed by the layering process to allocate appropriate segmentation IDs to unsegmented cells, thus separating individual vortices within the region. However, these regions may still suffer from inaccurate splits, which we address statistically by leveraging the continuity of vorticity lines across the split boundaries. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in both the separation of vortices and the mitigation of inaccurate splits compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian vs Eulerian view on the mean drift and streaming flows in orbital sloshing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital sloshing is a technique to gently mix a container's liquid content and it is commonly used in fermentation and cell cultivation processes. Besides the rich wave dynamics observed at the interface, Bouvard et al. (2017) [1] unveiled the structure of the Lagrangian mean flow hiding in the fluid bulk. The latter flow shows a global toroidal (azimuthal) rotation co-directed with the wave and nontrivial poloidal vortices near the contact line. Rotating sloshing waves are known to induce a net motion of fluid particles and hence a wave-averaged difference between the Eulerian flow - viscous streaming - and the Lagrangian flow, that is commonly referred to as Stokes drift. Nevertheless, discerning these two components in an experiment is challenging as they scale similarly with the forcing amplitude and frequency. Their relative contributions remain therefore unquantified, particularly for highly viscous fluids, for which prior analysis, based on inviscid arguments, fails. In this work, we construct a truncated asymptotic approximation of the problem, where the solution at each order is computed numerically to describe as accurately as possible the contact line region, otherwise analytically untractable. The results of this weakly nonlinear analysis in terms of first-order wave and second-order mean flow are then thoroughly compared with the experiments by Bouvard et al. (2017) [1], showing a remarkable agreement for off-resonance frequencies. When viscosity matters, our findings suggest that it is incorrect to attribute the poloidal patterns solely to the Eulerian streaming flow and that viscous corrections to the Stokes drift are equally important in the resulting mean Lagrangian flow.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of physics-based models of acoustically-forced laminar premixed conical flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform twenty experiments on an acoustically-forced laminar premixed Bunsen flame and assimilate high-speed footage of the natural emission into a physics-based model containing seven parameters. The experimental rig is a ducted Bunsen flame supplied by a mixture of methane and ethylene. A high-speed camera captures the natural emission of the flame, from which we extract the position of the flame front. We use Bayesian inference to combine this experimental data with our prior knowledge of this flame's behaviour. This prior knowledge is expressed through (i) a model of the kinematics of a flame front moving through a model of the perturbed velocity field, and (ii) a priori estimates of the parameters of the above model with quantified uncertainties. We find the most probable a posteriori model parameters using Bayesian parameter inference, and quantify their uncertainties using Laplace's method combined with first-order adjoint methods. This is substantially cheaper than other common Bayesian inference frameworks, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. This process results in a quantitatively-accurate physics-based reduced-order model of the acoustically forced Bunsen flame for injection velocities ranging from 1.75 m/s to 2.99 m/s and equivalence ratio values ranging from 1.26 to 1.47, using seven parameters. We use this model to evaluate the heat release rate between experimental snapshots, to extrapolate to different experimental conditions, and to calculate the flame transfer function and its uncertainty for all the flames. Since the proposed model relies on only seven parameters, it can be trained with little data and successfully extrapolates beyond the training dataset. Matlab code is provided so that the reader can apply it to assimilate further flame images into the model.</description>

      <title>Revisiting tea-leaf paradox with a deformable spoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tea-leaf paradox refers to the migration of tea leaves toward the center of a tea cup when the water is put in rotation by a spoon. Although much attention has been given to liquid and particle transport generated by a spoon, the back-action of the generated flow on a deformable spoon has not been considered. In this work, we therefore propose to revisit the tea-leaf paradox with a deformable stirrer consisting of a floating ball attached to a soft string. The later is set in rotation and the ball trajectory results from the balance between string tension and the back action of the surrounding flow, leading to surprising effects. At low rotation speeds, we show that the circular trajectory of the ball shrinks when we stir faster, which contradicts common intuition based on inertia. For higher rotation rates, the ball is either suddenly attracted toward the center, or is repulsed away from it, depending on the string length. A model explaining these observations is proposed, and validated using experimental measurements of the generated flow. Interestingly, the system exhibits strong hysteretic behavior, leading to a modified version of the tea-leaf paradox in which the spoon itself can be trapped at the center in the flow generated by its past motion.</description>

      <title>The interplay of shape and catalyst distribution in the yield of compressible flow microreactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>

      <title>Large scale response of a vehicle wake to on-road perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this research work is to analyse the large scale response of a vehicle wake to on-road perturbations by using an instrumented vehicle and a combination of scale one wind tunnel tests, track trials and on road experiments. More precisely, in all these tests, we focus on the analysis of the asymmetry of the pressure distribution at the base. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is used. For all cases considered, POD analysis reveals two dominant modes, respectively associated with vertical and horizontal wake large scale reorganisation. More than 50\% of the total energy is carried by these two modes and this value increases significantly for on-road tests. Noteworthy, the low-frequency energy content of the temporal coefficients of these modes is significantly higher on-road. Low frequencies (even very low ones) then play a major role, corresponding to a quasi-static perturbation domain of the velocity seen by the vehicle. We show that a quasi-steady exploration of the on-road yaw angle statistical distribution during a wind tunnel test captures phenomena similar to those observed on the road and is therefore interesting to evaluate on-road aerodynamic performances. This also opens perspectives for developing closed loop control strategies aiming to maintain a prescribed wake balance in order to reduce drag experienced on the road.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved phase-lock pressure-sensitive paint measurement of trailing edge noise dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) was applied to the surface of a NACA0012 airfoil to investigate pressure fluctuations associated with trailing edge (TE) noise under low-velocity flow conditions. The primary focus is to assess the feasibility of employing laser pulses exposed at the airfoil surface to mitigate TE noise. However, the weak pressure fluctuations accompanying TE noise pose a challenge, as they are overshadowed by image sensor noise in high-speed cameras capturing PSP emission changes. A novel time-resolved phase-locking technique was introduced to address this issue, utilizing the signal from a semiconductor pressure transducer at the trailing edge as a phase-lock trigger source. By repetitively conducting phase-locked measurements (1150 times), time series ensemble-averaged data based on PSP emission images were obtained, enabling the capture of these subtle pressure fluctuations. Quantitatively, fluctuations with a dominant frequency of 679 Hz and an amplitude of 50 Pa are resolved within an accuracy of about 15 Pa, achieved at a recording rate of 19.2 kHz. Both the suppression and subsequent redevelopment of the pressure field with the TE noise offer valuable insights into the dynamics of TE noise and open avenues for targeted noise reduction strategies in aerodynamic applications.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear room mode determines the operating conditions of a large-cavity synthetic jet actuator at low frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic Jet (SJ) actuators are an intrinsically complex combination of electronics, electric and mechanical systems. When studied theoretically, these elements are often simplified to coupled damped harmonic oscillators (DHO) that induce a pressure field within the cavity and drive momentum exchange. Thus, the performance of an SJ actuator results from coupling these DHOs, naturally leading to a few resonant modes. There is good evidence in the specialized literature of two resonant modes developing in SJ actuators: the membrane/piezoelectric mode and the Helmholtz resonance. In this work, we report on the effect of a third resonant mode that develops at very low frequencies due to a cavity much larger than the volume displaced by the actuator. We present evidence that the large-cavity dynamics determine the SJ performance in combination with the well-described formation criteria. We compare the intensity of this resonant mode with the first room modes using standard frequency analysis. Unlike typical room modes, the distribution of this resonant mode is very biased to lower frequencies. We also show that the resonant mode may be dimmed and focused by adding an obstacle in different cavity positions for the lower sound intensities. This mode overcomes the Helmholtz resonance, dominating the dynamics for higher sound intensities. We show that jet and vortex velocities mimic the sound pressure curve for the low-frequency range. Its effect mitigates for the higher range due to a delve through smaller stroke lengths, characterized as a fixed relation between the Reynolds and the Stokes numbers. We consider that the large-cavity dynamics is an additional element that, if integrated as design criteria, could extend the optimum frequency response of SJs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to present an enhancement to a Maxey-Riley theory proposed in recent years for the dynamics of inertial particles on the ocean surface. This model upgrade removes constraints on the reserve buoyancy, defined as the fraction of the particle volume above the ocean surface. The refinement results in an equation that correctly describes both the neutrally buoyant and fully buoyant particle scenarios.</description>

      <title>Crow instability of vortex lines in dipolar superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical inviscid fluids, parallel vortices perturbed by Kelvin waves may exhibit the Crow instability, where the mutual interaction of the Kelvin modes renders them dynamically unstable. This results in the mutual approach and reconnection of the vortices, leading to a cascaded decay into smaller and smaller vortex loops. We study the Crow instability of quantum vortex lines in a superfluid enjoying the anisotropic, long-ranged dipole-dipole interaction through mean-field simulations of the dynamics of the superfluid order parameter. We observe that both the strength and direction of the dipole-dipole interaction play a crucial role in determining the Kelvin modes that are dynamically favoured. This is shown to be linked to effective enhancements or suppressions of the vortices' curvature and can be explained by the effective dipole-dipole interaction between the vortex lines themselves. This paves the way to a deeper understanding of vortex reconnection dynamics, vortex loop cascading and turbulence in dipolar superfluids.</description>

      <title>Simulating carbon mineralization at pore scale in capillary networks of digital rock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the geometrical evolution of the pore space in geological formations due to fluid-solid interactions has applications in reservoir engineering, oil recovery, and geological storage of carbon dioxide. However, modeling frameworks that combine fluid flow with physical and chemical processes at a rock's pore scale are scarce. Here, we report a method for modeling a rock's pore space as a network of connected capillaries and to simulate the capillary diameter modifications caused by reactive flow processes. Specifically, we model mineral erosion, deposition, dissolution, and precipitation processes by solving the transport equations iteratively, computing diameter changes within each capillary of the network simultaneously. Our automated modeling framework enables simulations on digital rock samples as large as (1.125mm)$^3$ with 125$\times 10^6$ voxels within seconds of CPU time per iteration. As an application of the computational method, we have simulated brine injection and calcium carbonate precipitation in sandstone. For quantitatively comparing simulation results obtained with models predicting either a constant or a flow-rate dependent precipitation, we track the time-dependent capillary diameter distribution as well as the permeability of the connected pore space. For validation and reuse, we have made the automated simulation workflow, the reactive flow model library, and the digital rock samples available in public repositories.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Laws for a Generic Swimmer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a minimal model of a swimmer without body deformation based on force and torque dipoles which allows accurate 3D Navier-Stokes calculations. Our model can reproduce swimmer propulsion for a large range of Reynolds numbers, and generate wake vortices in the inertial regime, reminiscent of the flow generated by the flapping tails of real fish. We performed a numerical exploration of the model from low to high Reynolds numbers and obtained universal laws using scaling arguments. We collected data from a wide variety of micro-organisms, thereby extending the experimental data presented in (M. Gazzola et al., Nature Physics 10, 758, 2014). Our theoretical scaling laws compare very well with experimental data across the different regimes, from Stokes to turbulent flows. We believe that this model, due to its relatively simple design, will be very useful for obtaining numerical simulations of collective effects within fish schools composed of hundreds of individuals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscous electron flow exhibits exotic signatures such as superballistic conduction. Bending the geometry of the device is a must to observe hydrodynamic effects. To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction behaves non-monotonically with the magnetic field, which is related with the ballistic-hydrodynamic transition. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow, and the experiment provides valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced optimal transport for stochastic particle tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive flow measurement techniques, such as particle tracking velocimetry, resolve 3D velocity fields by pairing tracer particle positions in successive time steps. These trajectories are crucial for evaluating physical quantities like vorticity, shear stress, pressure, and coherent structures. Traditional approaches deterministically reconstruct particle positions and extract particle tracks using tracking algorithms. However, reliable track estimation is challenging due to measurement noise caused by high particle density, particle image overlap, and falsely reconstructed 3D particle positions. To overcome this challenge, probabilistic approaches quantify the epistemic uncertainty in particle positions, typically using a Gaussian probability distribution. However, the standard deterministic tracking algorithms relying on nearest-neighbor search do not directly extend to the probabilistic setting. Moreover, such algorithms do not necessarily find globally consistent solutions robust to reconstruction errors. This paper aims to develop a globally consistent nearest-neighborhood algorithm that robustly extracts stochastic particle tracks from the reconstructed Gaussian particle distributions in all frames. Our tracking algorithm relies on the unbalanced optimal transport theory in the metric space of Gaussian measures. Specifically, we optimize a binary transport plan for efficiently moving the Gaussian distributions of reconstructed particle positions between time frames. We achieve this by computing the partial Wasserstein distance in the metric space of Gaussian measures. Our tracking algorithm is robust to position reconstruction errors since it automatically detects the number of particles that should be matched through hyperparameter optimization. Finally, we validate our method using an in vitro flow experiment using a 3D-printed cerebral aneurysm.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric fluctuations and self-folding of active interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure and dynamics of the interface separating a passive fluid from a microtubule-based active fluid. Turbulent-like active flows power giant interfacial fluctuations, which exhibit pronounced asymmetry between regions of positive and negative curvature. Experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical arguments reveal how the interface breaks up the spatial symmetry of the fundamental bend instability to generate local vortical flows that lead to asymmetric interface fluctuations. The magnitude of interface deformations increases with activity: In the high activity limit, the interface self-folds invaginating passive droplets and generating a foam-like phase, where active fluid is perforated with passive droplets. These results demonstrate how active stresses control the structure, dynamics, and break-up of soft, deformable, and reconfigurable liquid-liquid interfaces.</description>

      <title>A unified view of elastic and elasto-inertial turbulence in channel flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chaotic flow of elastic fluids at low Reynolds number (Re) is typically distinguished into elasto-inertial and elastic turbulence (EIT/ET). However, the clear separation among these two turbulent regimes in parallel flows with a gradual Re decrease remains elusive. Here, spanning Re over four orders of magnitude, we investigate the statistical and structural nature of the flows computed by fully resolved 3D numerical simulations, revealing that as inertia becomes sub-dominant all flows share similar dynamical properties. Supported by the results, we thus propose a unified view of fully developed ET and EIT in parallel flows.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Scaling from Deep Learning Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex spatial and temporal structures are inherent characteristics of turbulent fluid flows and comprehending them poses a major challenge. This comprehesion necessitates an understanding of the space of turbulent fluid flow configurations. We employ a diffusion-based generative model to learn the distribution of turbulent vorticity profiles and generate snapshots of turbulent solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We consider the inverse cascade in two spatial dimensions and generate diverse turbulent solutions that differ from those in the training dataset. We analyze the statistical scaling properties of the new turbulent profiles, calculate their structure functions, energy power spectrum, velocity probability distribution function and moments of local energy dissipation. All the learnt scaling exponents are consistent with the expected Kolmogorov scaling. This agreement with established turbulence characteristics provides strong evidence of the model's capability to capture essential features of real-world turbulence.</description>

      <title>Exploiting decoupled discretization in meshless lattice Boltzmann method for high-Reynolds number flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most severe limitations of the Lattice Boltzmann Method in the context of simulating inertial flows is the coupling of the discretization of space to the velocity discretization. It causes the need to increase the size of computational meshes whenever one wants to increase the Reynolds number in the system for a fixed velocity and viscosity. This work aims at adopting the recently proposed meshless LBM formulation to the problem of high Reynolds number flows by using its internal property of decoupled space and velocity discretizations. In meshless formulation, one can change the reference length of the problem by scaling the distances between points that discretize the domain while the streaming distance remains fixed. By doing that, we increase the Reynolds number at no cost: additional nodes need not be inserted in the discretization. We measure the accuracy and efficiency of this approach in the flow around a circular obstacle at $Re=84$--$168$, the lid-driven cavity flow at $Re=100$--$5000$, and the flow through a porous sample at $Re=0.8$--$1500$. Additionally, we apply the meshless streaming step to the recently proposed fixed relaxation time $\tau=1$ LBM to extend its applicability to model inertial flows.</description>

      <title>Turbulent spectrum of 2D internal gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the turbulent energy spectrum of weakly interacting 2D internal gravity waves without relying on the hydrostatic approximation. This spectrum is an exact solution of the kinetic equation after the shear modes are removed, and it agrees with the oceanic Garrett-Munk spectrum for frequencies large compared to the Coriolis frequency and vertical scales small compared to the depth of the ocean. Among a continuous family of solutions to the kinetic equation, we show that the turbulent solution is the special solution with non zero angular dependent radial flux. Our solution provides an interesting insight of how turbulent energy cascade proceeds in anisotropic systems - similarly to isotropic turbulence it is self-similar in scale, but its angular part is peaked along the curve of vanishing frequency.</description>

      <title>Mass crystals and cage effect in vorticity crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the motion of tiny heavy inertial particles advected by a two dimensional inviscid fluid flow composed of $N$ identical point vortices regularly placed on a ring, and forming a crystal. In the limit of weak particle inertia, we show asymptotically that, in the reference frame of the crystal, inertial particles have $N$ asymptotically stable equilibrium positions located outside the crystal, in agreement with numerical observations by Ravichandran et al. (Sadhana 42, 2017). In addition to these "satellite" attracting points, we observe that for $N \ge 3$ the center of the ring, though degenerate, is a stable equilibrium position for inertial particles. This creates a kind of cage effect, where inclusions slowly drift towards the center under the effect of the surrounding vortices. This cage effect is observed to persist even at larger Stokes numbers, in contrast with the satellite attracting points that vanish when the Stokes number is above some critical value.</description>

      <title>Influence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity on the stability of atmospheric stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of atmospheric stratified fluids is revisited to study the influence of the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion in the Earth's lower atmosphere (with heights $0$ to $50$ km) under the action of gravity. Previous theory in the literature [Phys. Lett. A 480 (2023) 128990] is modified and advanced. It is found that the Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency associated with internal gravity waves is modified, leading to new instability conditions of vertically stratified fluids. The possibility of the onset of Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convective instability is also discussed, and the influences of the modified Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency and the density and temperature gradients on the instability growth rates are studied.</description>
