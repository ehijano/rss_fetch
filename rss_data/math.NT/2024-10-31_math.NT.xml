      <title>Universality criterion sets for quadratic forms over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analogy with the 290-Theorem of Bhargava-Hanke, a criterion set is a finite subset $C$ of the totally positive integers in a given totally real number field such that if a quadratic form represents all elements of $C$, then it necessarily represents all totally positive integers, i.e., is universal. We use a novel characterization of minimal criterion sets to show that they always exist and are unique, and that they must contain certain explicit elements. We also extend the uniqueness result to the more general setting of representations of a given subset of the integers.</description>

      <title>On additive complements in the complement of a set of natural numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a set of natural numbers. A set $B$, a set of natural numbers, is an additive complement of the set $A$ if all sufficiently large natural numbers can be represented in the form $x+y$, where $x\in A$ and $y\in B$. Erd\H{o}s proposed a conjecture that every infinite set of natural numbers has a sparse additive complement, and in 1954, Lorentz proved this conjecture. This article describes the existence or non-existence of those additive complements of the set $A$ that is a subset of the complement of $A$. We provide a ratio test to verify the existence of such additive complements. In precise, we prove that if $A=\{a_i: i\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a set of natural numbers such that $a_i&lt;a_{i+1} $ for $i \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty } (a_{n+1}/a_{n})&gt;1$, then there exists a set $B\subset \mathbb{N}\setminus A$ such that $B$ is a sparse additive complement of the set $A$.</description>

      <title>On a Special Metric in Cyclotomic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime, and let $\omega$ be a primitive $p$th root of unity. In this paper, we introduce a metric on the cyclotomic field $K=\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$. We prove that this metric has several remarkable properties, such as invariance under the action of the Galois group. Furthermore, we show that points in the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ behave in a highly uniform way under this metric. More specifically, we prove that for a certain hypercube in $\mathcal{O}_K$ centered at the origin, almost all pairs of points in the cube are almost equi-distanced from each other, when $p$ and $N$ are large enough. When suitably normalized, this distance is exactly $1/\sqrt{6}$.</description>

      <title>Conditional upper and lower bounds for $L$-functions in the Selberg class close to the critical line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we provide uniform upper and lower bounds with explicit main terms for $\log{\left|\mathcal{L}(s)\right|}$ for $\sigma \in (1/2,1)$ and for functions in the Selberg class. We also provide estimates under additional assumptions on the distribution of Dirichlet coefficients of $\mathcal{L}(s)$ on prime numbers. Moreover, by assuming a polynomial Euler product representation for $\mathcal{L}(s)$, we establish both uniform bounds, and completely explicit estimates by assuming also the strong $\lambda$-conjecture.</description>

      <title>Computing Selmer Groups for Elliptic Curves over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an algorithm to compute the $\varphi$-Selmer group of the elliptic curve $E_b: y^2 = x^3 + b x$ over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, where $b \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $\varphi$ is a degree 2 isogeny of $E_b$. We associate to $E_b$ a weighted graph $G_b$, whose vertices are the odd Gaussian primes dividing $b$, with the edge weight between two vertices determined by the quartic Legendre symbol of these primes. A bijection is established between elements of the $\varphi$-Selmer group of $E_b$ and certain partitions of $G_b$, leading to a linear-algebraic interpretation of the $\varphi$-Selmer group via the Laplacian matrix of $G_b$. This enables efficient computation of $S^{(\varphi)}(E_b/\mathbb{Q}(i))$ for any $b \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$. We then analyze the case where $b$ is a square in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, showing that $\# S^{(\varphi)}(E_b/\mathbb{Q}(i))$ depends only on the rank of the Laplacian $L(G_b)$ in this case. Finally, we implement our algorithm to compute the distribution of $\# S^{(\varphi)}(E_b/\mathbb{Q}(i))$ for the first 10,000 curves $E_b$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the derived Hecke action on the cohomology of an arithmetic manifold associated to the multiplicative group over a number field. The degree one part of the action is proved to be non-vanishing modulo $p$ under mild assumptions. The main ingredient is the Grunwald--Wang theorem.</description>

      <title>The index and its prime divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new interpretation of the classical index of appearance for second order linear recursive sequences. It stems from the formula \[ C_{n}(t)-2 =\frac{\Delta}{Q^{n}}\ L_n^2,\ \ \ \text{where} \ \ t= (T^2-2Q)/Q, \ \Delta = T^2-4Q, \] connecting the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind $C_n(x)$ with the Lucas sequence defined for integer $T,Q\neq 0$ by the recursion $L_{n+1}= TL_n-QL_{n-1}, L_0=0, L_1 = 1$. We build on the results of \cite{L-W}. We prove that for any prime $r\geq 2$ the sets $\Pi_j(t,r), j=1,2,\dots$, of primes $p$ such that $j$ is the highest power of $r$ dividing the index of appearance, have prime density equal to $\frac{1}{(r+1)r^{j-1}}$, for $r$-generic values of $t$. We give also complete enumeration of non-generic cases and the appropriate density formulas. It improves on the work of Lagarias, \cite{L}, and Ballot, \cite{B1},\cite{B2},\cite{B3}, on the sets of prime divisors of sequences of "finite order". Our methods are sufficient to prove that for any linear recursive sequence of second order (with some trivial exceptions) the set of primes not dividing any element contains a subset of positive density. We consider also some applications in arithmetic dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we'll introduce a $q$-variant of Witt vectors and de Rham-Witt complexes. This variant is closely related to the Habiro ring of a number field constructed by Garoufalidis, Scholze, Wheeler, and Zagier, to $q$-Hodge cohomology, and to $\operatorname{THH}(-/\mathrm{ku})$. While most of these connections will only be explored in forthcoming work, the goal of this article is to provide the necessary technical foundation.</description>

      <title>Integral representations of the Riemann zeta function of odd argument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we obtain, using an expression of the digamma function $\psi(x)$ due to Mikolas, integral representations of the zeta function of odd arguments $\zeta(2p+1)$ for any positive value of $p$. The integrand consists of the product of a polynomial by one or two elementary trigonometric functions. Examples for the first values of the argument are given. Some of them were already derived by other methods.</description>

      <title>A proof of a conjecture on trivariate permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we show (for a large enough dimension of the underlying field) a conjecture of [C. Beierle, C. Carlet, G. Leander, L. Perrin, {\em A further study of quadratic APN permutations in dimension nine}, Finite Fields Appl. 81 (2022), 102049] on a trivariate permutation. This function is a global representation of two new sporadic quadratic APN permutations in dimension $9$ found by [C. Beierle, G. Leander, {\em New instances of quadratic APN functions}, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 68(1) (2022), 670--678].</description>

Abstract: Let $\ell$ be a prime number and consider the group $\pi=\langle a,b\ \vert\ a^{\ell(\ell-1)}ba^{-\ell}b^{-2}\rangle$. We prove that $\Gamma_{\ell}$ is not $\mathrm{SL}_2$-weakly integral with obstruction at exactly the prime $\ell$. We also give a general description of the character varieties of $2$-generated groups with a relation of the form $a^{n_1} b^{m_1} a^{n_2} b^{m_1} = 1$.</description>

      <title>A note on non-integrality of the $(k,l)$-G\"{o}bel sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $(k,l)$-G\"{o}bel sequences defined by Ibstedt remain integers for the first (in some cases, many) terms, but for selected values of $(k,l)$, computations show that the terms eventually stop being integers after a certain point. It is still unresolved whether the integrality of these sequences breaks down for all $k, l\geq 2$. In this article, we prove the non-integrality for a specific class of $(k,l)$ values.</description>

      <title>$p$-converse theorems for elliptic curves of potentially good ordinary reduction at Eisenstein primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbf{Q}$ be an elliptic curve and $p\geq 3$ be a prime. We prove the $p$-converse theorems for elliptic curves of potentially good ordinary reduction at Eisenstein primes (i.e., such that the residual representation $E[p]$ is reducible) when the $p$-Selmer rank is $0$ or $1$. The key step is to obtain the anticyclotomic Iwasawa Main Conjectures for an auxiliary imaginary quadratic field $K$ where $E$ does not have CM similar to those in [CGLS22] and descent to $\mathbf{Q}$.
  As an application we get improved proportions for the number of elliptic curves in quadratic twist families having rank $0$ or $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a sub-$p$-adic field. We show that the functor sending a finite type $K$-scheme to its \'etale topos is fully faithful after localizing at the class of universal homeomorphisms. This generalizes a result of Voevodsky, who proved the analogous theorem for fields finitely generated over $\mathbb{Q}$. Our proof relies on Mochizuki's Hom-theorem in anabelian geometry, and a study of point-theoretic morphisms of fundamental groups of curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the twisted doubling zeta integrals of Cai-Friedberg-Ginzburg-Kaplan in the setting of algebraic families. We then prove a rationality result and a functional equation for these zeta integrals. This allows us to define an unnormalized $\gamma$-factor associated to certain families of representation of a classical group times a general linear group.</description>

      <title>Tschirnhausen bundles of covers of the projective line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A degree $d$ genus $g$ cover of the complex projective line by a smooth curve $C$ yields a vector bundle on the projective line by pushforward of the structure sheaf. Which bundles are possible? Equivalently, which $\mathbb{P}^{d-2}$-bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1$ contain such covers? (In the language of many previous papers: what are the scrollar invariants of the cover?)
  We give a complete answer in degree $4$, which exhibits the expected pathologies. We describe a polytope (one per degree) which we propose gives the complete answer for primitive covers, i.e. covers that don't factor through a subcover. We show that all such bundles (for primitive covers) lie in this polytope, and that a ``positive proportion'' of the polytope arises from smooth covers. Moreover, we show the necessity of the primitivity assumption. Finally, we show that the map from the Hurwitz space of smooth covers to the space of bundles is not flat (for $d&gt;3$ and $g \gg_d 0$).</description>

Abstract: We prove, assuming resolution of singularities in positive characteristic, an analogue of Siegel's theorem on sum of squares in positive characteristic. The method of proof combines techniques from central simple algebras with model theory and builds on work of Anscombe, Dittmann and Fehm.
  As an application, we show that, for each finite field $\mathbb{F}$ of odd characteristic and any positive integer $n$ coprime with the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}$, the first-order theory of the field given by the compositum of the fields generated by adjoining the $n$--th roots of all monic irreducible polynomials in $\mathbb{F}[t]$, of degree divisible by $n$ is undecidable in the language of rings with the variable $t$ as a constant.</description>

Abstract: Linear second order recursive sequences with arbitrary initial conditions are studied. For sequences with the same parameters a ring and a group is attached, and isomorphisms and homomorphisms are established for related parameters. In the group, called the {\it sequence group}, sequences are identified if they differ by a scalar factor, but not if they differ by a shift, which is the case for the Laxton group. Prime divisors of sequences are studied with the help of the sequence group $\mod p$, which is always cyclic of order $p\pm 1$. Even and odd numbered subsequences are given independent status through the introduction of one rational parameter in place of two integer parameters. This step brings significant simplifications in the algebra. All elements of finite order in Laxton groups and sequence groups are described effectively. A necessary condition is established for a prime $p$ to be a divisor of a sequence: {\it the norm (determinant) of the respective element of the ring must be a quadratic residue $\mod p$}. This leads to an uppers estimate of the set of divisors by a set of prime density $1/2$. Numerical experiments show that the actual density is typically close to $0.35$. A conjecture is formulated that the sets of prime divisors of the even and odd numbered elements are independent for a large family of parameters.</description>

      <title>Subspace configurations and low degree points on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to understanding curves $X$ over a number field $k$ that possess infinitely many solutions in extensions of $k$ of degree at most $d$; such solutions are the titular low degree points. For $d=2,3$ it is known (by the work of Harris-Silverman and Abramovich-Harris) that such curves, after a base change to $\overline{k},$ admit a map of degree at most $d$ onto $\mathbb{P}^1$ or an elliptic curve. For $d \geqslant 4$ the analogous statement was shown to be false by Debarre and Fahlaoui. We prove that once the genus of $X$ is high enough, the low degree points still have geometric origin: they can be obtained as pullbacks of low degree points from a lower genus curve. We introduce a discrete-geometric invariant attached to such curves: a family of subspace configurations, with many interesting properties. This structure gives a natural alternative construction of curves with many low degree points, that were first discovered by Debarre and Fahlaoui. As an application of our methods, we obtain a classification of such curves over $k$ for $d=2,3$, and a classification over $\overline{k}$ for $d=4,5$.</description>

      <title>Covering integers by $x^2 + dy^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What proportion of integers $n \leqslant N$ may be expressed as $x^2 + dy^2$ for some $d \leqslant \Delta$, with $x,y $ integers? Writing $\Delta$ as $(\log N)^{\log 2} 2^{\alpha \sqrt{\log \log N}}$ for some $\alpha \in (-\infty, \infty)$, we show that the answer is $\Phi(\alpha) + o(1)$, where $\Phi$ is the Gaussian distribution function $\Phi(\alpha) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int^{\alpha}_{-\infty} e^{-x^2/2} dx$.
  A consequence of this is a phase transition: almost none of the integers $n \leqslant N$ can be represented by $x^2 + dy^2$ with $d \leqslant (\log N)^{\log 2 - \varepsilon}$, but almost all of them can be represented by $x^2 + dy^2$ with $d \leqslant (\log N)^{\log 2 + \varepsilon}$.</description>

Abstract: For a non-archimedean local field $F$ and a connected reductive group $G$ over $F$ equipped with a parabolic subgroup $P$, we show that the dualizing complex on $\mathrm{Bun}_P$, the moduli stack of $P$-bundles on the Fargues--Fontaine curve, can be described explicitly in terms of the modulus character of $P$. As applications, we identify various characters appearing in the theory of local and global Shimura varieties, show the Harris--Viehmann conjecture in the Hodge--Newton reducible case, and carry out some computations of the geometric Eisenstein functors for general parabolics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we will modify the Breuil-Hellmann-Schraen's (more generally, resp.,Breuil-Ding's) local model for the trianguline variety (resp.,Bernstein paraboline variety) to certain semistable (resp., potentially semistable) non-crystalline point with regular Hodge-Tate weights. Then we deduce several local-global compatibility results, including a classicality result, and the existence of expected companion points on the (definite) eigenvariety and locally analytic socle conjecture for certain semistable non-crystalline Galois representations (in other words, the so-called Steinberg case), under some wild hypothesis on on trianguline variety and the usual Taylor-Wiles assumptions.</description>

      <title>On the anticyclotomic Iwasawa theory of newforms at Eisenstein primes of semistable reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a newform of weight $k=2r$ and level $N$ with trivial nebentypus. Let $\mathfrak{p}\nmid 2N$ be a maximal ideal of the ring of integers of the coefficient field of $f$ such that the self-dual twist of the mod-$\mathfrak{p}$ Galois representation of $f$ is reducible with constituents $\phi,\psi$. Denote a decomposition group over the rational prime $p$ below $\mathfrak{p}$ by $G_p$. We remove the condition $\phi|_{G_p} \neq \mathbf{1}, \omega$ from [CGLS22], and generalize their results to newforms of higher weights $2r$ with $r$ being odd. As a consequence, we prove some Iwasawa Main Conjectures and get the $p$-part of the strong BSD Conjecture for elliptic curves of analytic rank $0$ or $1$ over $\mathbf{Q}$ in this setting. In particular, non-trivial $p$-torsion is allowed in the Mordell--Weil group. Using Hida families, we also prove an Iwasawa Main Conjecture for newforms of weight $2$ of multiplicative reduction at Eisenstein primes. In the above situations, we also get $p$-converse to the theorems of Gross--Zagier--Kolyvagin. The $p$-converse theorems have applications to Goldfeld's conjecture in certain quadratic twist families of elliptic curves having a $3$-isogeny.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we improve on two explicit bounds of order $\log t$ for $\sigma$ close to $1$: $|\zeta'(\sigma +it)/\zeta(\sigma +it)|$ and $|1/\zeta(\sigma +it)|$. Our method provides marked improvements in the constants, especially with regards to the latter. These savings come from replacing a lemma of Borel and Carath\'{e}dory, with a Jensen-type one of Heath-Brown's. Using an argument involving the trigonometric polynomial, we additionally provide a slight asymptotic improvement: $1/\zeta(\sigma +it) \ll (\log t)^{11/12}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triple symbols are arithmetic analogues of the mod $n$ triple linking number in topology, where $n &gt; 1$ is an integer. In this paper, we introduce a cohomological formulation of a mod $n$ triple symbol for characters over a number field containing a primitive $n$-th root of unity. Our definition is motivated by the arithmetic Chern--Simons theory and in this respect it differs from earlier approaches to triple symbols. We show that our symbol agrees with that of R\'edei when $n=2$ and of Amano--Mizusawa--Morishita when $n=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the number theory in positive characteristic, there are analogues of some special values introduced by Carlitz, Carlitz gamma values and Carlitz zeta values for instance. Each of them is further developed to arithmetic gamma values and multiple zeta values by Goss and Thakur respectively. In this paper, by generalizing a result of Chang-Papanikolas-Thakur-Yu (2010), we obtain the algebraic independence of certain arithmetic gamma values, positive characteristic multiple zeta values of restricted indices and hyperderivatives of their deformations. We prove this by using Chang-Papanikolas-Yu's derivation, Maurichat's prolongation, Namoijam's formula and Papanikolas' theory of $t$-motivic Galois group.</description>

      <title>First-order factors of linear Mahler operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and compare two algorithms for computing first-order right-hand factors in the ring of linear Mahler operators$\ell_r M^r + \dots + \ell_1 M + \ell_0$where $\ell_0, \dots, \ell_r$ are polynomials in~$x$ and $Mx = x^b M$ for some integer $b \geq 2$. In other words, we give algorithms for finding all formal infinite product solutions of linear functional equations$\ell_r(x) f(x^{b^r}) + \dots + \ell_1(x) f(x^b) + \ell_0(x) f(x) = 0$. The first of our algorithms is adapted from Petkov\v{s}ek's classical algorithm forthe analogous problem in the case of linear recurrences. The second one proceeds by computing a basis of generalized power series solutions of the functional equation and by using Hermite-Pad{\'e} approximants to detect those linear combinations of the solutions that correspond to first-order factors. We present implementations of both algorithms and discuss their use in combination with criteria from the literature to prove the differential transcendence of power series solutions of Mahler equations.</description>

      <title>Solutions for $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers using Fuss-Catalan numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new expressions for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers, say $F_k(n)$. They satisfy the recurrence $F_k(n) = F_k(n-1) +\dots+F_k(n-k)$. Explicit expressions for the roots of the auxiliary (or characteristic) polynomial are presented, using Fuss-Catalan numbers. Properties of the roots are enumerated. We quantify the accuracy of asymptotic approximations for $F_k(n)$ for $n\gg1$. Our results subsume and extend some results published by previous authors. We also comment on the use of multinomial sums for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers and related sequences. We also employ the generating function to express $F_k(n)$ as a concise (non-nested) sum of binomial coefficients for arbitrary $k$. Finally, we present a basis (or `fundamental solutions') to solve the above recurrence for arbitrary initial conditions.</description>
