      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Feedback Control for Hyperbolic Balance Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian framework for feedback boundary control for hyperbolic balance laws. The method propagates a probability distribution over feedback parameters by using Lyapunov decay estimates as a likelihood. In the linear setting, the framework recovers the available analytical results, while simultaneously extending them to nonlinear regimes where such results are not readily accessible. We first validate the method using the first-order local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) discretizations on linear models -- the decoupled wave system and the linearized Saint-Venant equations -- recovering the known stability intervals and mixed boundary couplings reported in the control literature. We then consider nonlinear and stochastic settings, including the nonlinear Saint-Venant system and Burgers equation with random initial data, as well as a nonconservative perturbation with source terms, and demonstrate that the computed stability domains remain accurate and robust with respect to the choice of indicator and the initial prior. We further show that the methodology carries over to a second-order semi-discrete LLF scheme and to a model with two interacting control parameters for the temperature field development in laser powder bed fusion with feedback power regulation. These numerical experiments confirm consistency with available theory on benchmark cases and highlight the practicality of the proposed, discretization-agnostic feedback selection procedure.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a numerical scheme for 3-wave kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several numerical schemes for 3-wave kinetic equations have been proposed in recent work and shown to be accurate and computationally efficient [8,33,34,35]. However, their rigorous numerical analysis remains open. This paper aims to close this gap. We establish a comprehensive well-posedness and qualitative theory for the
  discrete equation arising from those schemes. We prove
  global existence, uniqueness, and Lipschitz stability of nonnegative classical solutions
  in $\ell^1(\mathbb{N})$, together with uniform bounds and decay of moments. We further
  show exponential energy decay and a sharp creation and propagation of positivity
  characterized by the arithmetic structure of the initial support. Finally, we obtain
  the propagation and instantaneous creation of polynomial, Mittag-Leffler, and
  exponential moments, providing quantitative control of high energy tails. We validate the theoretical findings by numerical results.</description>

      <title>Generalized Inverses of Matrix Products: From Fundamental Subspaces to Randomized Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and generalized inverse of a matrix product $A=CR$ to establish a unifying framework for generalized and randomized matrix inverses. This analysis is rooted in first principles, focusing on the geometry of the four fundamental subspaces. We examine:
  (1) the reverse order law, $A^+ = R^+C^+$, which holds when $C$ has independent columns and $R$ has independent rows,
  (2) the universally correct formula, $A^+ = (C^+CR)^+(CRR^+)^+$, providing a geometric interpretation of the mappings between the involved subspaces,
  (3) a new generalized randomized formula, $A^+_p = (P^TA)^+P^TAQ(AQ)^+$, which gives $A^+_p = A^+$ if and only if the sketching matrices $P$ and $Q$ preserve the rank of $A$, i.e., $\mathrm{rank}(P^TA) = \mathrm{rank}(AQ) = \mathrm{rank}(A)$.
  The framework is extended to generalized $\{1,2\}$-inverses and specialized forms, revealing the underlying structure of established randomized linear algebra algorithms, including randomized SVD, the Nystr\"om approximation, and CUR decomposition. We demonstrate applications in sparse sensor placement and effective resistance estimation. For the latter, we provide a rigorous quantitative analysis of an approximation scheme, establishing that it always underestimates the true resistance and deriving a worst-case spectral bound on the error of resistance differences.</description>

      <title>A Cayley-free Two-Step Algorithm for Inverse Singular Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate numerical solutions for inverse singular value problems (for short, ISVPs) arising in various applications. Inspired by the methodologies employed for inverse eigenvalue problems, we propose a Cayley-free two-step algorithm for solving the ISVP. Compared to the existing two-step algorithms for the ISVP, our algorithm eliminates the need for Cayley transformations and consequently avoids solving $2(m+n)$ linear systems during the computation of approximate singular vectors at each outer iteration. Under the assumption that the Jacobian matrix at a solution is nonsingular, we present a convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm and prove a cubic root-convergence rate. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete approximation of the semilinear stochastic wave equation on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semilinear stochastic wave equation on the sphere driven by multiplicative Gaussian noise is discretized by a stochastic trigonometric integrator in time and a spectral Galerkin approximation in space based on the spherical harmonic functions. Strong and almost sure convergence of the explicit fully discrete numerical scheme are shown. Furthermore, these rates are confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Massively parallel Schwarz methods for the high frequency Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the parallel one-level overlapping Schwarz method for solving finite element discretization of high-frequency Helmholtz equations. The resulting linear systems are large, indefinite, ill-conditioned, and complex-valued. We present a practical variant of the restricted additive Schwarz method with Perfectly Matched Layer transmission conditions (RAS-PML), which was originally analyzed in a theoretical setting in {\tt arXiv:2404.02156}, with some numerical experiments given in {\tt arXiv:2408.16580}. In our algorithm, the width of the overlap and the additional PML layer on each subdomain is allowed to decrease with $\mathcal{O}(k^{-1} \log(k))$, as the frequency $k \rightarrow \infty$, and this is observed to ensure good convergence while avoiding excessive communication. In experiments, the proposed method achieves $\mathcal{O}(k^d)$ parallel scalability under Cartesian domain decomposition and exhibits $\mathcal{O}(k)$ iteration counts and convergence time for $d$-dimensional Helmholtz problems ($d = 2,3$) as $k$ increases. In this preliminary note we restrict to experiments on 2D problems with constant wave speed. Details, analysis and extensions to variable wavespeed and 3D will be given in future work.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Eigenfunction Network (FEENet): A Hybrid Framework for Solving PDEs on Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators aim to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, but their performance often degrades on complex or irregular geometries due to the lack of geometry-aware representations. We propose the Finite Element Eigenfunction Network (FEENet), a hybrid spectral learning framework grounded in the eigenfunction theory of differential operators. For a given domain, FEENet leverages the Finite Element Method (FEM)toperformaone-timecomputationofaneigenfunctionbasisintrinsictothegeometry. PDE solutions are subsequently represented in this geometry-adapted basis, and learning is reduced to predicting the corresponding spectral coefficients. Numerical experiments conducted across a range of parameterized PDEs and complex two- and three-dimensional geometries, including benchmarks against the seminal DeepONet framework (1), demonstrate that FEENet consistently achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency. We further highlight key advantages of the proposed approach, including resolution-independent inference, interpretability, and natural generalization to nonlocal operators defined as functions of differential operators. We envision that hybrid approaches of this form, which combine structure-preserving numerical methods with data-driven learning, offer a promising pathway toward solving real-world PDE problems on complex geometries.</description>

      <title>A New Combination of Preconditioned Gradient Descent Methods and Vector Extrapolation Techniques for Nonlinear Least-Squares Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector extrapolation methods are widely used in large-scale simulation studies, and numerous extrapolation-based acceleration techniques have been developed to enhance the convergence of linear and nonlinear fixed-point iterative methods. While classical extrapolation strategies often reduce the number of iterations or the computational cost, they do not necessarily lead to a significant improvement in the accuracy of the computed approximations. In this paper, we study the combination of preconditioned gradient-based methods with extrapolation strategies and propose an extrapolation-accelerated framework that simultaneously improves convergence and approximation accuracy. The focus is on the solution of nonlinear least-squares problems through the integration of vector extrapolation techniques with preconditioned gradient descent methods. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments is carried out to study the behavior of polynomial-type extrapolation methods and the vector $\varepsilon$-algorithm when coupled with gradient descent schemes, with and without preconditioning. The results demonstrate the impact of extrapolation techniques on both convergence rate and solution accuracy, and report iteration counts, computational times, and relative reconstruction errors. The performance of the proposed hybrid approaches is further assessed through a benchmarking study against Gauss--Newton methods based on generalized Krylov subspaces.</description>

      <title>High-order DLM-ALE discretizations with robust operator preconditioning for fluid-rigid-body interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the design of deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) microfluidic devices, we develop a high-order numerical framework for fluid-rigid-body interaction on fitted moving meshes. Rigid-body motion is enforced by a distributed Lagrange multiplier (DLM) formulation, while the moving fluid domain is treated by an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) mapping. In space, we use isoparametric Taylor-Hood elements to achieve high-order accuracy and to represent curved boundaries and the fluid-particle interface. In time, we employ a high-order partitioned Runge-Kutta strategy in which the mesh motion is advanced explicitly and the coupled physical fields are advanced implicitly, yielding high-order accuracy for the particle trajectory. The fully coupled system is linearized into a generalized Stokes problem subject to distributed constraints of incompressibility and rigid-body motion. We establish well-posedness of this generalized Stokes formulation at both the continuous and discrete levels, providing the stability foundation for operator preconditioning that is robust with respect to key physical and discretization parameters. Numerical experiments on representative benchmarks, including a DLD case, demonstrate high-order convergence for the fluid solution and rigid-body dynamics, as well as robust iterative convergence of the proposed preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Surrogate to Poincar\'e inequalities on manifolds for structured dimension reduction in nonlinear feature spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the approximation of continuously differentiable functions with high-dimensional input by a composition of two functions: a feature map that extracts few features from the input space, and a profile function that approximates the target function taking the features as its low-dimensional input. We focus on the construction of structured nonlinear feature maps, that extract features on separate groups of variables, using a recently introduced gradient-based method that leverages Poincar\'e inequalities on nonlinear manifolds. This method consists in minimizing a non-convex loss functional, which can be a challenging task, especially for small training samples. We first investigate a collective setting, in which we construct a feature map suitable to a parametrized family of high-dimensional functions. In this setting we introduce a new quadratic surrogate to the non-convex loss function and show an upper bound on the latter. We then investigate a grouped setting, in which we construct separate feature maps for separate groups of inputs, and we show that this setting is almost equivalent to multiple collective settings, one for each group of variables.</description>

      <title>Novel linear, decoupled, and energy dissipative schemes for the Navier-Stokes-Darcy model and extension to related two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct efficient original-energy-dissipative schemes for the Navier-Stokes-Darcy model and related two-phase flows using a prediction-correction framework. A new relaxation technique is incorporated in the correction step to guarantee dissipation of the original energy, thereby ensuring unconditional boundedness of the numerical solutions for velocity and hydraulic head in the $l^{\infty}(L^2)$ and $l^2(H^1)$ norms. At each time step, the schemes require solving only a sequence of linear equations with constant coefficients. We rigorously prove that the schemes dissipate the original energy and, as an example, carry out a rigorous error analysis of the first-order scheme for the Navier-Stokes-Darcy model. Finally, a series of benchmark numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A survey of scalar and vector extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar extrapolation and convergence acceleration methods are central tools in numerical analysis for improving the efficiency of iterative algorithms and the summation of slowly convergent series. These methods construct transformed sequences that converge more rapidly to the same limit without altering the underlying iterative process, thereby reducing computational cost and enhancing numerical accuracy. Historically, the origins of such techniques can be traced back to classical algebraic methods by AlKhwarizmi and early series acceleration techniques by Newton, while systematic approaches emerged in the 20th century with Aitken process and Richardson extrapolation. Later developments, including the Shanks transformation and Wynn epsilon algorithm, provided general frameworks capable of eliminating multiple dominant error components, with deep connections to Pade approximants and rational approximations of generating functions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of classical scalar extrapolation methods, including Richardson extrapolation, Aitken process, Shanks transformation, Wynn epsilon algorithm, and other algorithms. We examine their theoretical foundations, asymptotic error models, convergence properties, numerical stability, and practical implementation considerations. The second part of this work is dedicated to vector extrapolation methods: polynomial based ones and epsilon algorithm generalizations to vector sequences. Additionally, we highlight modern developments such as their applications to iterative solvers, Krylov subspace methods, and large-scale computational simulations. The aim of this review is to provide a unified perspective on scalar and vector extrapolation techniques, bridging historical origins, theoretical insights, and contemporary computational applications.</description>

      <title>Finite element theta schemes for the viscous Burgers' equation with nonlinear Neumann boundary feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a fully discrete numerical scheme for the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) viscous Burgers equations with nonlinear Neumann boundary feedback control. The temporal discretization employs a $\theta$-scheme, while a conforming finite element method is used for the spatial approximation. The existence and uniqueness of the fully discrete solution are established. We further prove that the scheme is unconditionally exponentially stable for $\theta \in [1/2, 1]$, thereby ensuring that the stabilization property of the continuous model is retained at the discrete level. In addition, optimal error estimates are obtained for both the state variable and the boundary control inputs in 1D and 2D frameworks. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to validate our theoretical findings and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization strategy under varying model parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article surveys nonlinear model reduction methods that remain effective in regimes where linear reduced-space approximations are intrinsically inefficient, such as transport-dominated problems with wave-like phenomena and moving coherent structures, which are commonly associated with the Kolmogorov barrier. The article organizes nonlinear model reduction techniques around three key elements -- nonlinear parametrizations, reduced dynamics, and online solvers -- and categorizes existing approaches into transformation-based methods, online adaptive techniques, and formulations that combine generic nonlinear parametrizations with instantaneous residual minimization.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Multimodal Sampling via Preconditioned Annealed Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing algorithms that can explore multimodal target distributions accurately across successive refinements of an underlying high-dimensional problem is a central challenge in sampling. Annealed Langevin dynamics (ALD) is a widely used alternative to classical Langevin since it often yields much faster mixing on multimodal targets, but there is still a gap between this empirical success and existing theory: when, and under which design choices, can ALD be guaranteed to remain stable as dimension increases? In this paper, we help bridge this gap by providing a uniform-in-dimension analysis of continuous-time ALD for multimodal targets that can be well-approximated by Gaussian mixture models. Along an explicit annealing path obtained by progressively removing Gaussian smoothing of the target, we identify sufficient spectral conditions - linking smoothing covariance and the covariances of the Gaussian components of the mixture - under which ALD achieves a prescribed accuracy within a single, dimension-uniform time horizon. We then establish dimension-robustness to imperfect initialization and score approximation: under a misspecified-mixture score model, we derive explicit conditions showing that preconditioning the ALD algorithm with a sufficiently decaying spectrum is necessary to prevent error terms from accumulating across coordinates and destroying dimension-uniform control. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate and validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Beyond Taylor: Divergence-Based Functional Expansions and Their Application to Numerical Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new functional expansion framework that extends classical ideas beyond the Taylor series. Unlike traditional Taylor expansions based on local polynomial approximations, the proposed approach arises from exact differential identities that link a function and its derivatives through polynomial weight factors. This formulation expresses smooth functions via divergence-based relations connecting derivatives of all orders with systematically scaled polynomial coefficients. This framework provides a natural foundation for constructing high-order numerical quadrature formulas, particularly for multi-dimensional domains. By exploiting the divergence structure, volume integrals are systematically transformed into boundary integrals using the Divergence Theorem, recursively reducing the integration domain from an $n$-dimensional body to its $(n-1)$-dimensional facets, and ultimately to its vertices.
  The article further enhances the framework's accuracy by introducing a complex-shift technique. It is demonstrated that by positioning the expansion center at specific roots of unity in the complex plane, lower-order error terms are annihilated, yielding high-order real-valued quadrature rules with minimal function evaluations. Additionally, a rigorous geometric analysis of the affine transformations required for surface integration is provided, deriving explicit formulas for the transformation of normal vectors and surface measures. The proposed method offers a robust, systematic, and computationally efficient alternative to tessellation-based quadrature for arbitrary flat-faced polytopes.</description>

      <title>Third-Order Geometric-Volume Conservation in Cahn--Hilliard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degenerate Cahn-Hilliard phase-field models provide a robust approximation of surface-diffusion-driven interface motion without explicit front tracking. In computations, however, the geometric volume enclosed by the interface -- the region where the order parameter $\phi$ is positive -- may drift at finite interface thickness, producing artificial shrinkage or growth even when the sharp-interface limit conserves volume. We revisit and extend the improved-conservation framework of Zhou et al., where one replaces classical mass conservation by the exact conservation of a designed monotone mapping $Q(\phi)$ that more accurately approximates a step function. Building on this framework, we (i) carry out the matched-asymptotic analysis in the unscaled physical time formulation, (ii) derive a simplified representation of the first-order inner correction to the interface profile, and (iii) identify an integral-moment cancellation condition that controls the leading geometric-volume defect. This mechanism becomes a practical design rule: we select regularization kernels within parameterized families -- including exponential and Pade-type -- to reach effective higher-order behavior and satisfy the cancellation condition at moderate parameter values. As a result, the proposed kernels achieve formal third-order accuracy in geometric-volume conservation with respect to interface thickness. Finally, we describe an unconditional energy-dissipative numerical discretization that exactly preserves the discrete conserved quantity. Numerical benchmarks on multi-scale droplet coarsening and shape relaxation demonstrate that the moment-balanced kernels virtually eliminate artificial drift and prevent premature extinction of small droplets.</description>

      <title>Geometric Generalization of Neural Operators from Kernel Integral Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators are neural network-based surrogate models for approximating solution operators of parametric partial differential equations, enabling efficient many-query computations in science and engineering. Many applications, including engineering design, involve variable and often nonparametric geometries, for which generalization to unseen geometries remains a central practical challenge. In this work, we adopt a kernel integral perspective motivated by classical boundary integral formulations and recast operator learning on variable geometries as the approximation of geometry-dependent kernel operators, potentially with singularities. This perspective clarifies a mechanism for geometric generalization and reveals a direct connection between operator learning and fast kernel summation methods. Leveraging this connection, we propose a multiscale neural operator inspired by Ewald summation for learning and efficiently evaluating unknown kernel integrals, and we provide theoretical accuracy guarantees for the resulting approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate robust generalization across diverse geometries for several commonly used kernels and for a large-scale three-dimensional fluid dynamics example.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Numerical Analysis of Mixed Variational-hemivariational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to well-posedness analysis and the numerical solution of a family of general elliptic mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities. Various mixed variational equations, mixed variational inequalities and mixed hemivariational inequalities found in the literature are special cases of the mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities. Well-posedness of the mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities and their numerical approximations are studied via the projection iteration technique. Error analysis of the numerical methods is presented. The results are applied to the study of a variational-hemivariational inequality of the Stokes equations for incompressible fluid flows subject to slip conditions of frictional type, both monotone and non-monotone. Optimal order error estimates are derived for the use of some stable finite element space pairs under certain solution regularity assumptions. Numerical results are reported demonstrating the theoretical prediction of convergence orders.</description>

      <title>Equilibrated-flux residual certification for verified existence and outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a post-processing certification workflow for nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems that upgrades a standard finite element computation to a rigorous existence and output certificate. For a given approximate discrete state, we verify existence and local uniqueness of a weak solution in a computable neighbourhood via a Newton--Kantorovich argument based on three certified ingredients: a guaranteed dual-norm residual bound, a computable lower bound for the stability constant of the linearised operator, and a Lipschitz bound for the derivative on the verification ball. The residual bound is obtained by an equilibrated-flux reconstruction exploiting an explicit relation between nonconforming and mixed formulations, yielding $H(\mathrm{div})$-conforming fluxes without local mixed solves. The stability ingredient follows from a computable coercivity lower bound for the linearisation. An admissible verification radius is selected by a simple bracketing--bisection search, justified for an affine Lipschitz model. Once the verification ball is certified, we derive guaranteed enclosures for quantities of interest using computable variation bounds; an adjoint-based correction, in the spirit of goal-oriented error estimation, tightens these intervals while retaining full rigour. Numerical experiments for semilinear diffusion--reaction models show that the certificates are informative and that the adjoint enhancement substantially reduces enclosure widths.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods for diffusion coefficient recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the inverse problem of reconstructing a spatially varying diffusion coefficient in stationary elliptic equations from boundary Cauchy data. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce a gradient-weighted modification of the coupled complex-boundary method (CCBM) incorporating an \(H^1\)-type term, and formulate the reconstruction as a regularized optimization problem over bounded admissible coefficients. We establish continuity and differentiability of the forward map, Lipschitz continuity of the modified cost functional, existence of minimizers, stability with respect to noisy data, and convergence under vanishing noise. From a numerical perspective, reconstructions are computed using a Sobolev-gradient descent scheme and evaluated through extensive numerical experiments across a range of noise levels, boundary inputs, and coefficient structures. In the reported tests, for sufficiently large but not excessive $H^1$-weights, the modified CCBM is observed to yield more stable reconstructions and to reduce certain high-frequency artifacts. Across the numerical scenarios considered in this study, the method often demonstrates favorable stability and robustness properties relative to several classical boundary-based formulations, although performance remains problem- and parameter-dependent. A projection-based extension further supports stable recovery of piecewise-constant diffusion coefficients in multi-subregion test cases. Our results indicate that, as long as all subdomains share a portion of the boundary, the proposed CCBM-based Tikhonov regularization approach with a pick-a-point strategy enables stable and reliable reconstruction of diffusion parameters.</description>

      <title>Curvature Preserving Fractal Interpolation Functions: A Hybrid Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal interpolation functions (FIFs) generated using iterated function systems (IFS) provide a powerful framework for modeling self-similar and irregular data, yet traditional constructions often neglect geometric fidelity such as curvature. In this paper, we introduce a curvature-preserving variant of FIFs built upon a classical cubic spline interpolant. We define a curvature-aware iterated function system (IFS) with parameters optimized via a penalty-based approach to minimize deviation from the curvature of the classical spline. Theoretical conditions for interpolation and curvature approximation are derived. We compare the curvature of the proposed FIF with that of the classical cubic spline and discrete data curvature across multiple examples. Our method achieves both data interpolation and shape fidelity, preserving curvature more accurately than standard splines. The approach has potential applications in geometric modeling, computer graphics, and scientific data interpolation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Pseudospectral Analysis via Low-Rank Approximations of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudospectral analysis is fundamental for quantifying the sensitivity and transient behavior of nonnormal matrices, yet its computational cost scales cubically with dimension, rendering it prohibitive for large-scale systems. While existing research on scalable pseudospectral computation has focused on exploiting sparsity structures, common in discretizations of differential operators, these approaches are ill-suited for machine learning and data-driven dynamical systems, where operators are typically dense but approximately low-rank. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive low-rank framework that dramatically reduces this computational burden. Our core theoretical contribution is an exact characterization of the pseudospectrum of arbitrary low-rank matrices, reducing the evaluation of resolvent norms to eigenvalue problems of dimension proportional to the rank. Building on this foundation, we derive rigorous inclusion sets for the pseudospectra of general matrices via truncated and randomized low-rank approximations, with explicit perturbation bounds. These results enable efficient estimators for key stability quantities, including distance to instability and Kreiss constants, at a cost that scales with the effective rank rather than the ambient dimension. We further demonstrate how our framework naturally extends to data-driven settings, providing pseudospectral analysis of transfer operators learned from nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems. Numerical experiments confirm orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving accuracy, opening pseudospectral analysis to previously intractable high-dimensional problems in computational PDEs, control theory, and data-driven dynamics.</description>

      <title>PINN-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with RAR-D Adaptive Sampling for Solving Elliptic Interface Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular and powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), leveraging neural networks to approximate solutions while embedding PDE constraints, boundary conditions, and interface jump conditions directly into the loss function. However, most existing PINN approaches are based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which may require large network sizes and extensive training to achieve high accuracy, especially for complex interface problems. In this work, we propose a novel PINN architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which offer greater flexibility in choosing activation functions and can represent functions with fewer parameters. Specifically, we introduce a dual KANs structure that couples two KANs across subdomains and explicitly enforces interface conditions. To further boost training efficiency and convergence, we integrate the RAR-D adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically refine training points. Numerical experiments on the elliptic interface problems yield more uniform error distributions across the computational domain, which demonstrates that our PINN-based KANs achieve superior accuracy with significantly smaller network sizes and faster convergence compared to standard PINNs.</description>

      <title>Convergence of high-index saddle dynamics for degenerate saddle points on critical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-index saddle dynamics (HiSD) method provides a powerful framework for finding saddle points and constructing solution landscapes. While originally derived for nondegenerate critical points, HiSD has demonstrated empirical success in degenerate cases, where the Hessian matrix exhibits zero eigenvalues. However, the mathematical and numerical analysis of HiSD for degenerate saddle points remains unexplored. In this paper, utilizing Morse-Bott functions, we present a rigorous analysis of HiSD for computing degenerate saddle points on a critical manifold. We prove the local convergence of the continuous HiSD and establish the linear convergence rate of the discrete HiSD algorithm. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the gradient alignment tendency, revealing that the gradient direction asymptotically aligns with a specific Hessian eigenvector. Our analysis also elucidates the flexibility in selecting the index for HiSD in the context of degenerate saddle points. We validate our analytical results through numerical experiments on neural-network loss landscapes and demonstrate that momentum-accelerated variants of HiSD achieve rapid convergence to degenerate saddle points.</description>

      <title>Multigrid Poisson Solver for Complex Geometries Using Finite Difference Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient numerical method, inspired by transformation optics, for solving the Poisson equation in complex and arbitrarily shaped geometries. The approach operates by mapping the physical domain to a uniform computational domain through coordinate transformations, which can be applied either to the entire domain or selectively to specific boundaries inside the domain. This flexibility allows both homogeneous (Laplace equation) and inhomogeneous (Poisson equation) problems to be solved efficiently using iterative or fast direct solvers, with only the material parameters and source terms modified according to the transformation. The method is formulated within a finite difference framework, where the modified material properties are computed from the coordinate transformation equations, either analytically or numerically. This enables accurate treatment of arbitrary geometric shapes while retaining the simplicity of a uniform grid solver. Numerical experiments confirm that the method achieves second-order accuracy , and offers a straightforward pathway to integrate fast solvers such as multigrid methods on the uniform computational grid.</description>

      <title>A Flux-Correction Form of the Third-Order Edge-Based Scheme for a General Numerical Flux Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we present a flux-correction form of the third-order edge-based scheme for the Euler equations that enables the direct use of a general flux function. The core idea is to replace, without loss of accuracy, the arithmetic average of the flux extrapolations by a general numerical flux evaluated at the edge midpoint, together with a correction term. We show that the proposed flux-correction form preserves third-order accuracy, provided that the general numerical flux is evaluated with the left and right states that are computed exactly for a quadratic function, which can be achieved effectively by the U-MUSCL scheme with {\kappa} = 1/2. Numerical results are presented to verify third-order accuracy with the HLLC and LDFSS flux functions on irregular tetrahedral grids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents MLH-ALE, a monolithic localized high-order arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element method for multi-scale fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The framework employs isoparametric $\mathcal{P}_2$ elements for geometric fidelity and an implicit-explicit partitioned Runge-Kutta (IMEX-PRK) scheme for temporal discretization. To address scale disparity, a localized updating strategy is integrated to focus computational resolution on the moving structure. Numerical benchmarks confirm the optimal high-order convergence of the underlying ALE scheme. Furthermore, simulations of particle focusing in spiral microchannels demonstrate that the MLH-ALE approach provides reliable numerical results in good agreement with experimental observations, confirming its feasibility for complex multi-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity-based regularization of inverse medium scattering for shape reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the scattering of time-harmonic plane waves by a compactly supported inhomogeneous scattering obstacle governed by the Helmholtz equation. Given far field observations of the scattered fields corresponding to plane wave incident fields for all possible incident and observation directions we study the inverse problem to recover the support of the scatterer. We propose a qualitative monotonicity-based regularization scheme which combines monotonicity-based shape reconstruction with one-step linearization to reconstruct a discrete approximation of the shape of the scatterer from noisy far field data. The purpose of the one-step linearization is to stabilize the monotonicity approach to shape reconstruction. We show that the monotonicity-based regularization scheme recovers the correct shape of the scatterer for noise-free data. Furthermore, we establish that the solution of the monotonicity-based regularization converges to the exact solution as the noise level tends to zero. We present numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider approximation or recovery of functions based on a finite number of function evaluations. This is a well-studied problem in optimal recovery, machine learning, and numerical analysis in general, but many fundamental insights were obtained only recently. We discuss different aspects of the information-theoretic limit that appears because of the limited amount of data available, as well as algorithms and sampling strategies that come as close to it as possible.
  We also discuss (optimal) sampling in a broader sense, allowing other types of measurements that may be nonlinear, adaptive and random, and present several relations between the different settings in the spirit of information-based complexity. We hope that this article provides both, a basic introduction to the subject and a contemporary summary of the current state of research.</description>

      <title>On the Numerical Treatment of an Abstract Nonlinear System of Coupled Hyperbolic Equations Associated with the Timoshenko Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work addresses the Cauchy problem for an abstract nonlinear system of coupled hyperbolic equations associated with the Timoshenko model in a real Hilbert space. Our purpose is to develop and delve into a temporal discretization scheme for approximating a solution to this problem. To this end, we propose a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete time-stepping scheme in which the nonlinear term is evaluated at the temporal midpoint. As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Convex limiting for finite elements and its relationship to residual distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some recent advances in the field of element-based algebraic stabilization for continuous finite element discretizations of nonlinear hyperbolic problems. The main focus is on multidimensional convex limiting techniques designed to constrain antidiffusive element contributions rather than fluxes. We show that the resulting schemes can be interpreted as residual distribution methods. Two kinds of convex limiting can be used to enforce the validity of generalized discrete maximum principles in this context. The first approach has the structure of a localized flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm, in which the computation of a low-order predictor is followed by an antidiffusive correction stage. The second option is the use of a monolithic convex limiting (MCL) procedure at the level of spatial semi-discretization. In both cases, inequality constraints are imposed on scalar functions of intermediate states that are required to stay in convex invariant sets.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a least-squares splitting method for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the theoretical convergence of the nonlinear least-squares splitting method for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation in which each iteration decouples the pointwise nonlinearity from the differential operator and consists of a local nonlinear update followed by the solution of two sequential Poisson-type elliptic problems. While the method performs well in computations, a rigorous convergence theory has remained unavailable. We observe that the iteration admits a reformulation as an alternating-projection scheme on Sobolev spaces $H^m$, $m\ge 0$. At a solution, the G\^ateaux differentials of the projection maps are the linear projections onto the corresponding tangent spaces. We prove that these tangent spaces are transverse, and hence the linearization of the alternating-projection map is a contraction by classical Hilbert-space theory for alternating projections. Building on this geometric characterization, we prove linear convergence in $H^2$ of the splitting method on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ for initial data sufficiently close to a solution $u\in H^4$. To the best of our knowledge, this yields the first rigorous convergence result for this splitting method in the periodic setting and provides a functional-analytic explanation for its observed numerical robustness.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric L\'evy walks driven by convex combination of fractional material derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a class of linear partial differential equations that arise as deterministic descriptions of the scaling limits of L\'evy walks, in which transport is driven by a convex combination of fractional material derivatives and a source term. Using techniques of Fourier-Laplace transforms, we first prove the existence of mild solutions for continuous initial data. Using a recently obtained pointwise representation of the fractional material derivative, we then identify a necessary and sufficient condition on the source term that guaranties the solution to remain a probability density for all times (non-negativity and unit mass). Motivated by the need to preserve these probabilistic properties in computations, we construct a finite-volume discretization that is probability conservative by construction. We establish discrete stability and a convergence result for the continuous weak solution as space and time steps tend to zero. Extensive numerical experiments validate the scheme: total mass is conserved, non-negativity is maintained, and the computed solutions reproduce the known analytic representations of the probability density functions associated with the L\'evy walk process. The combined theoretical and numerical framework provides a reliable tool for studying anomalous transport governed by fractional dynamics.</description>

      <title>A new Energy Equation Derivation for the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow Water Moment Equations (SWME) are extensions to the well-known Shallow Water Equations (SWE) for the efficient modeling and numerical simulation of free-surface flows. While the SWE typically assume a depth-averaged vertical velocity profile, the SWME allow for vertical variations of the velocity profile. The SWME therefore assume a polynomial profile and then derive additional evolution equations for the polynomial coefficients via higher order depth integration. In this work, we perform a new systematic derivation of the energy equation for a specific variant of the SWME, called the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations (SWLME). The derivation is based on the standard SWE energy equation derivation and includes the skew-symmetric formulation of the model. The new systematic derivation is beneficial for the extension to other SWME variants and their numerical solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1410.5402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for obtaining discretization formulas for the derivatives of a function is presented, which relies on a generalization of divided differences. These modified divided differences essentially correspond to a change of the dependent variable. This method is applied to the numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem for the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation, where standard methods converge very slowly while the approach proposed here gives accurate results.</description>

Abstract: This paper implements an efficient numerical algorithm for the time-fractional Black-Scholes model governing European options. The proposed method comprises the Crank-Nicolson approach to discretize the time variable and exponential B-spline approximation for the space variable. The implemented method is unconditionally stable. We present few numerical examples to confirm the theory.

      <title>Stabilizing Fixed-Point Iteration for Markov Chain Poisson Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poisson equations underpin average-reward reinforcement learning, but beyond ergodicity they can be ill-posed, meaning that solutions are non-unique and standard fixed point iterations can oscillate on reducible or periodic chains. We study finite-state Markov chains with $n$ states and transition matrix $P$. We show that all non-decaying modes are captured by a real peripheral invariant subspace $\mathcal{K}(P)$, and that the induced operator on the quotient space $\mathbb{R}^n/\mathcal{K}(P)$ is strictly contractive, yielding a unique quotient solution. Building on this viewpoint, we develop an end-to-end pipeline that learns the chain structure, estimates an anchor based gauge map, and runs projected stochastic approximation to estimate a gauge-fixed representative together with an associated peripheral residual. We prove $\widetilde{O}(T^{-1/2})$ convergence up to projection estimation error, enabling stable Poisson equation learning for multichain and periodic regimes with applications to performance evaluation of average-reward reinforcement learning beyond ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Hessian Scaling for Local and Global Costs in Variational Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barren plateaus are typically characterized by vanishing gradients, yet the feasibility of curvature-based optimization fundamentally relies on the statistical resolvability of the Hessian matrix. In this work, we quantify the entrywise resolvability of the Hessian for Variational Quantum Algorithms at random initialization. By leveraging exact second-order parameter-shift rules, we derive a structural representation that reduces the variance of Hessian entries to a finite covariance quadratic form of shifted cost evaluations. This framework reveals two distinct scaling regimes that govern the sample complexity required to resolve Hessian entries against shot noise. For global objectives, we prove that Hessian variances are exponentially suppressed, implying that the number of measurement shots must scale as $O(e^{\alpha n})$ with the number of qubits $n$ to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast, for termwise local objectives in bounded-depth circuits, the variance decay is polynomial and explicitly controlled by the backward lightcone growth on the interaction graph, ensuring that curvature information remains statistically accessible with $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ shots. Extensive numerical experiments across varying system sizes and circuit depths demonstrate these theoretical bounds and the associated sampling costs. Our results provide a rigorous criterion for the computational tractability of second-order methods at initialization.</description>

      <title>Denoising deterministic networks using iterative Fourier transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail a novel Fourier-based approach (IterativeFT) for identifying deterministic network structure in the presence of both edge pruning and Gaussian noise. This technique involves the iterative execution of forward and inverse 2D discrete Fourier transforms on a target network adjacency matrix. The denoising ability of the method is achieved via the application of a sparsification operation to both the real and frequency domain representations of the adjacency matrix with algorithm convergence achieved when the real domain sparsity pattern stabilizes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we apply it to noisy versions of several deterministic models including Kautz, lattice, tree and bipartite networks. For contrast, we also evaluate preferential attachment networks to illustrate the behavior on stochastic graphs. We compare the performance of IterativeFT against simple real domain and frequency domain thresholding, reduced rank reconstruction and locally adaptive network sparsification. Relative to the comparison network denoising approaches, the proposed IterativeFT method provides the best overall performance for lattice and Kuatz networks with competitive performance on tree and bipartite networks. Importantly, the InterativeFT technique is effective at both filtering noisy edges and recovering true edges that are missing from the observed network.</description>

      <title>RMFlow: Refined Mean Flow by a Noise-Injection Step for Multimodal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean flow (MeanFlow) enables efficient, high-fidelity image generation, yet its single-function evaluation (1-NFE) generation often cannot yield compelling results. We address this issue by introducing RMFlow, an efficient multimodal generative model that integrates a coarse 1-NFE MeanFlow transport with a subsequent tailored noise-injection refinement step. RMFlow approximates the average velocity of the flow path using a neural network trained with a new loss function that balances minimizing the Wasserstein distance between probability paths and maximizing sample likelihood. RMFlow achieves near state-of-the-art results on text-to-image, context-to-molecule, and time-series generation using only 1-NFE, at a computational cost comparable to the baseline MeanFlows.</description>

      <title>Towards Multiscale Graph-based Protein Learning with Geometric Secondary Structural Motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning protein structures by capturing spatial relationships at the residue level. However, existing GNN-based methods often face challenges in learning multiscale representations and modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. In this work, we propose an efficient multiscale graph-based learning framework tailored to proteins. Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $\alpha$-helices, $\beta$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchical framework preserves the desired maximal expressiveness, ensuring no loss of critical structural information. Empirically, we demonstrate that integrating baseline GNNs into our multiscale framework remarkably improves prediction accuracy and reduces computational cost across various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Improving Flow Matching by Aligning Flow Divergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) stands out as an efficient, simulation-free approach for training flow-based generative models, achieving remarkable performance for data generation. However, CFM is insufficient to ensure accuracy in learning probability paths. In this paper, we introduce a new partial differential equation characterization for the error between the learned and exact probability paths, along with its solution. We show that the total variation gap between the two probability paths is bounded above by a combination of the CFM loss and an associated divergence loss. This theoretical insight leads to the design of a new objective function that simultaneously matches the flow and its divergence. Our new approach improves the performance of the flow-based generative model by a noticeable margin without sacrificing generation efficiency. We showcase the advantages of this enhanced training approach over CFM on several important benchmark tasks, including generative modeling for dynamical systems, DNA sequences, and videos.

      <title>On the Convergence of Jacobian-Free Backpropagation for Optimal Control Problems with Implicit Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal feedback control with implicit Hamiltonians poses a fundamental challenge for learning-based value function methods due to the absence of closed-form optimal control laws. Recent work~\cite{gelphman2025end} introduced an implicit deep learning approach using Jacobian-Free Backpropagation (JFB) to address this setting, but only established sample-wise descent guarantees. In this paper, we establish convergence guarantees for JFB in the stochastic minibatch setting, showing that the resulting updates converge to stationary points of the expected optimal control objective. We further demonstrate scalability on substantially higher-dimensional problems, including multi-agent optimal consumption and swarm-based quadrotor and bicycle control. Together, our results provide both theoretical justification and empirical evidence for using JFB in high-dimensional optimal control with implicit Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Estimation of Seabed and Its Roughness With Longitudinal Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an infinite-dimensional Bayesian framework for acoustic seabed tomography, leveraging wave scattering to simultaneously estimate the seabed and its roughness. Tomography is considered an ill-posed problem where multiple seabed configurations can result in similar measurement patterns. We propose a novel approach focusing on the statistical isotropy of the seabed. Utilizing fractional differentiability to identify seabed roughness, the paper presents a robust numerical algorithm to estimate the seabed and quantify uncertainties. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of this method, offering a promising avenue for large-scale seabed exploration.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification and Adaptive Residual Learning for Efficient Solution of Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws directly into neural network training. However, solving high-fidelity PDEs remains computationally prohibitive, particularly for parametric systems requiring multiple evaluations across varying parameter configurations. This paper presents MF-BPINN, a novel multi-fidelity framework that synergistically combines physics-informed neural networks with Bayesian uncertainty quantification and adaptive residual learning. Our approach leverages abundant low-fidelity simulations alongside sparse high-fidelity data through a hierarchical neural architecture that learns nonlinear correlations across fidelity levels. We introduce an adaptive residual network with learnable gating mechanisms that dynamically balances linear and nonlinear fidelity discrepancies. Furthermore, we develop a rigorous Bayesian framework employing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Global stabilization and finite element analysis of the viscous Burgers' equation with memory subject to Neumann boundary feedback control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a global stabilization result of the viscous Burgers' equation with the memory term by applying Neumann boundary feedback control laws. We construct suitable feedback control inputs using the control Lyapunov functional and establish stabilization in the \(L^{2}, H^{1},\) and \(H^{2}\)-norms. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are established through the Faedo-Galerkin method. Moreover, we show the global stabilization where the diffusion coefficient $\nu$ is unknown. Then, we apply a \(C^{0}\)-conforming finite element method to the spatial variable while keeping the time variable continuous. Furthermore, we obtain global stabilization of the semi-discrete scheme and optimal error estimates for the state variable in the \(L^{\infty}\), \(L^{2}\), and \(H^{1}\)-norms, using the Ritz-Volterra projection. Additionally, error estimates for the feedback control laws are established. Lastly, we present some numerical simulations to demonstrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Regularization for Multi-Phase 2D Euler Equations via Competing Transport Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization framework for the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equation that exactly preserves the transport structure of multi-phase vorticity fields. The key step is a reformulation of multi-phase vortex patch data in terms of a finite family of passively advected scalar marker functions: at each point, the local vorticity is determined by a smooth, pointwise selection rule arising from competition among these markers. The scheme introduces no spatial diffusion or mollification; all regularization originates solely from the marker selection mechanism. As the sharpness parameter $\beta\to\infty$, we prove uniform convergence of the transported marker functions on finite time intervals. Moreover, under a geometric nondegeneracy condition on the underlying Euler interface network, we establish Hausdorff convergence of the evolving interfacial structures and exponential-in-$\beta$ pointwise convergence of the regularized vorticity away from the tie sets to the corresponding sharp multi-phase vortex patch solution. Finally, we show that the loss of pointwise convergence coincides precisely with the onset of geometric degeneracy in the Euler interface dynamics.</description>

      <title>Training-free score-based diffusion for parameter-dependent stochastic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating parameter-dependent stochastic differential equations (SDEs) presents significant computational challenges, as separate high-fidelity simulations are typically required for each parameter value of interest. Despite the success of machine learning methods in learning SDE dynamics, existing approaches either require expensive neural network training for score function estimation or lack the ability to handle continuous parameter dependence. We present a training-free conditional diffusion model framework for learning stochastic flow maps of parameter-dependent SDEs, where both drift and diffusion coefficients depend on physical parameters. The key technical innovation is a joint kernel-weighted Monte Carlo estimator that approximates the conditional score function using trajectory data sampled at discrete parameter values, enabling interpolation across both state space and the continuous parameter domain. Once trained, the resulting generative model produces sample trajectories for any parameter value within the training range without retraining, significantly accelerating parameter studies, uncertainty quantification, and real-time filtering applications. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three numerical examples of increasing complexity, showing accurate approximation of conditional distributions across varying parameter values.</description>

      <title>A-posteriori-steered $p$-robust multigrid and domain decomposition methods with optimal step-sizes for mixed finite element discretizations of elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop algebraic solvers for linear systems arising from the discretization of second-order elliptic partial differential equations by saddle-point mixed finite element methods of arbitrary polynomial degree $p \ge 0$ on possibly highly graded simplicial meshes. We present a multigrid and a two-level domain decomposition approach in two and three space dimensions, steered by a posteriori estimators of the algebraic error. First, we extend [Mira\c{c}i, Pape\v{z}, and Vohral\'ik, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 43 (2021), S117-S145] to the mixed finite element setting. Extending the multigrid procedure itself is rather natural. To obtain analogous theoretical results, however, a $p$-robust multilevel stable decomposition of the velocity space is needed. In two space dimensions, we can treat the velocity space as the curl of a stream-function Lagrange space, for which the previous results apply. In three space dimensions, we design a novel stable decomposition by combining a one-level high-order local stable decomposition of [Falk and Winther, Found. Comput. Math. (2025), DOI 10.1007/s10208- 025-09700-2] and a multilevel lowest-order stable decomposition of [Hiptmair, Wu, and Zheng, Numer. Math. Theory Methods Appl. 5 (2012), 297-332]. This allows us to prove that our multigrid solver contracts the algebraic error at each iteration $p$-robustly and, simultaneously, that the associated a posteriori estimator is $p$-robustly efficient. Next, we use this multilevel methodology to define a two-level domain decomposition method where the subdomains consist of overlapping patches of coarse-level elements sharing a common coarse-level vertex. We again establish a $p$-robust contraction of the solver and $p$-robust efficiency of the a posteriori estimator. Numerical results presented both for the multigrid approach and the domain decomposition method confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel tangential-normal ($t$-$n$) decomposition for finite element differential forms, presenting a new framework for constructing bases in finite element exterior calculus. The main contribution is the development of a $t$-$n$ basis where degrees of freedom and shape functions are explicitly dual, a property that streamlines stiffness matrix assembly and enhances the efficiency of interpolation and numerical integration. Additionally, the integration of the well-documented Lagrange element basis supports practical implementation of finite element differential forms in applications. A geometric decomposition using newly defined bubble polynomial forms is also presented.</description>

      <title>Median QMC method for unbounded integrands over $\mathbb{R}^s$ in unanchored weighted Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration of Lebesgue integrable functions with respect to a density function over $\mathbb{R}^s$. We extend the construction-free median QMC rule proposed by Goda and L'ecuyer (SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2022) to the weighted unanchored Sobolev space of functions defined over $\mathbb{R}^s$ introduced by Nichols and Kuo (J. Complexity, 2014). By taking the median of $k = \mathcal{O}(\log N)$ independent randomized QMC estimators, we prove that for any $\epsilon\in (0,r-\frac{1}{2}]$, our method achieves a mean absolute error bound of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-r+\epsilon})$, where $N$ is the number of points and $r&gt;\frac{1}{2}$ is a parameter determined by the function space. This rate matches the rate of randomly shifted lattice rules obtained via a component-by-component (CBC) construction, while our approach requires no specific CBC constructions or prior knowledge of the space's weight structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method attains an accuracy comparable to the CBC construction based method, and outperforms the Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>An adaptive multimesh rational approximation scheme for the spectral fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel multimesh rational approximation scheme for the numerical solution of the (homogeneous) Dirichlet problem for the spectral fractional Laplacian. The scheme combines a rational approximation of the function $\lambda \mapsto \lambda^{-s}$ with a family of finite element discretizations of parameter-dependent, non-fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). The key idea that underpins the proposed scheme is that each parametric PDE is numerically solved on an individually tailored finite element mesh. This is in contrast to existing single-mesh approaches that employ the same finite element mesh across all parametric PDEs. We develop an a posteriori error estimation strategy for the proposed rational approximation scheme and design an adaptive multimesh refinement algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our adaptive multimesh approach achieves faster convergence rates than uniform mesh refinement and yields significant reductions in computational costs -- both in terms of the overall number of degrees of freedom and the actual runtime -- when compared to the corresponding adaptive algorithm in a single-mesh setting.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bernstein and betting confidence intervals for randomized quasi-Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods estimate the mean of a random variable by sampling an integrand at $n$ equidistributed points. For scrambled digital nets, the resulting variance is typically $\tilde O(n^{-\theta})$ where $\theta\in[1,3]$ depends on the smoothness of the integrand and $\tilde O$ neglects logarithmic factors. While RQMC can be far more accurate than plain Monte Carlo (MC) it remains difficult to get confidence intervals on RQMC estimates. We investigate some empirical Bernstein confidence intervals (EBCI) and hedged betting confidence intervals (HBCI), both from Waudby-Smith and Ramdas (2024), when the random variable of interest is subject to known bounds. When there are $N$ integrand evaluations partitioned into $R$ independent replicates of $n=N/R$ RQMC points, and the RQMC variance is $\Theta(n^{-\theta})$, then an oracle minimizing the width of a Bennett confidence interval would choose $n =\Theta(N^{1/(\theta+1)})$. The resulting intervals have a width that is $\Theta(N^{-\theta/(\theta+1)})$. Our empirical investigations had optimal values of $n$ grow slowly with $N$, HBCI intervals that were usually narrower than the EBCI ones, and optimal values of $n$ for HBCI that were equal to or smaller than the ones for the oracle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to approximate a continuously differentiable function $u:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by a composition of functions $f\circ g$ where $g:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, $m\leq d$, and $f : \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are built in a two stage procedure. For a fixed $g$, we build $f$ using classical regression methods, involving evaluations of $u$. Recent works proposed to build a nonlinear $g$ by minimizing a loss function $\mathcal{J}(g)$ derived from Poincar\'e inequalities on manifolds, involving evaluations of the gradient of $u$. A problem is that minimizing $\mathcal{J}$ may be a challenging task. Hence in this work, we introduce new convex surrogates to $\mathcal{J}$. Leveraging concentration inequalities, we provide suboptimality results for a class of functions $g$, including polynomials, and a wide class of input probability measures. We investigate performances on different benchmarks for various training sample sizes. We show that our approach outperforms standard iterative methods for minimizing the training Poincar\'e inequality based loss, often resulting in better approximation errors, especially for small training sets and $m=1$.</description>

      <title>On general and complete multidimensional Riemann solvers for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a framework to design multidimensional Riemann solvers for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws on general unstructured polygonal Voronoi-like tessellations. In this framework we propose two simple but complete solvers. The first method is a direct extension of the Osher-Solomon Riemann solver to multiple space dimensions. Here, the multidimensional numerical dissipation is obtained by integrating the absolute value of the flux Jacobians over a dual triangular mesh around each node of the primal polygonal grid. The required nodal gradient is then evaluated on a local computational simplex involving the d+1 neighbors meeting at each corner. The second method is a genuinely multidimensional upwind flux. By introducing a fluctuation form of finite volume methods with corner fluxes, we show an equivalence with residual distribution schemes (RD). This naturally allows to construct genuinely multidimensional upwind corner fluxes starting from existing and well-known RD fluctuations. In particular, we explore the use of corner fluxes obtained from the so-called N scheme, i.e. the Roe's original optimal multidimensional upwind advection scheme. Both methods use the full eigenstructure of the underlying hyperbolic system and are therefore complete by construction. A simple higher order extension up to fourth order in space and time is then introduced at the aid of a CWENO reconstruction in space and an ADER approach in time, leading to a family of high order accurate fully-discrete one-step schemes based on genuinely multidimensional Riemann solvers. We present applications of our new numerical schemes to several test problems for the compressible Euler equations of gas-dyanamics. In particular, we show that the proposed schemes are at the same time carbuncle-free and preserve certain stationary shear waves exactly.</description>

To ensure the preservation of structural properties, i.e. conservation of mass and internal energy as well as entropy production, we introduce a suitable variational formulation for the continuous problem, based on the entropy equation. Analytical findings are supported by numerical tests, including convergence analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents and analyses a new family of linear subdivision schemes to refine noisy data given on triangular meshes. The subdivision rules consist of locally fitting and evaluating a weighted least squares approximating first-degree polynomial. This type of rules, applicable to any type of triangular grid, including finite grids or grids containing extraordinary vertices, are geometry-dependent which may result in non-uniform schemes. For these new subdivision schemes, we are able to prove reproduction, approximation order, denoising capabilities and, for some special type of grids, convergence as well. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that their performance is similar to advanced local linear regression methods but their subdivision nature makes them suitable for use within a multiresolution context as well as to deal with noisy geometric data as shown with an example.</description>

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for approximating solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, conventional approaches typically rely on pointwise function discretizations, which often suffer from the curse of dimensionality, mesh dependence, and prohibitive training costs in high-resolution settings. To address these challenges, we propose the Fixed-Basis Coefficient to Coefficient Operator Network (FB-C2CNet), a novel framework that learns the operator mapping within the coefficient spaces induced by prescribed, fixed basis functions. Unlike existing methods that learn basis functions dynamically or rely on extensive sensor grids, FB-C2CNet encodes input functions onto a fixed set of basis functions (such as random features or finite element bases) and employs a neural network to predict the expansion coefficients of the solution. By decoupling basis selection from network training, this formulation significantly reduces the dimensionality of the input-output spaces and the number of trainable parameters. We further introduce metrics such as effective rank to analyze how the spectral properties of the coefficient space influence generalization performance. Extensive numerical experiments across a wide spectrum of benchmarks -- including linear, nonlinear, and high-dimensional problems -- demonstrate that FB-C2CNet achieves competitive predictive accuracy while reducing training time by orders of magnitude compared to conventional neural operators.</description>

      <title>Neural Multiscale Decomposition for Solving The Nonlinear Klein-Gordon Equation with Time Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00266v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a neural multiscale decomposition method (NeuralMD) for solving the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$ from the relativistic regime to the nonrelativistic limit regime. The solution of the NKGE propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ and $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in space and time, respectively, which brings the oscillation in time. Existing collocation-based methods for solving this equation lead to spectral bias and propagation failure. To mitigate the spectral bias induced by high-frequency time oscillation, we employ a multiscale time integrator (MTI) to absorb the time oscillation into the phase. This decomposes the NKGE into a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with wave operator (NLSW) with well-prepared initial data and a remainder equation with small initial data. As $\varepsilon \to 0$, the NKGE converges to the NLSW at rate $O(\varepsilon^{2})$, and the contribution of the remainder equation becomes negligible. Furthermore, to alleviate propagation failure caused by medium-frequency time oscillation, we propose a gated gradient correlation correction strategy to enforce temporal coherence in collocation-based methods. As a result, the approximation of the remainder term is no longer affected by propagation failure. Comparative experiments with existing collocation-based methods demonstrate the superior performance of our method for solving the NKGE with various regularities of initial data over the whole regime.</description>

      <title>Milstein-type Schemes for Hyperbolic SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal approximation of hyperbolic semilinear stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise by Milstein-type schemes. We take the term hyperbolic to mean that the leading operator generates a contractive, not necessarily analytic $C_0$-semigroup. Optimal convergence rates are derived for the pathwise uniform strong error \[
  E_h^\infty := \Big(\mathbb{E}\Big[\max_{1\le j \le M}\|U_{t_j}-u_j\|_X^p\Big]\Big)^{1/p} \] on a Hilbert space $X$ for $p\in [2,\infty)$. Here, $U$ is the mild solution and $u_j$ its Milstein approximation at time $t_j=jh$ with step size $h&gt;0$ and final time $T=Mh&gt;0$. For sufficiently regular nonlinearity and noise, we establish strong convergence of order one, with the error satisfying $E_h^\infty\lesssim h\sqrt{\log(T/h)}$ for rational Milstein schemes and $E_h^\infty \lesssim h$ for exponential Milstein schemes. This extends previous results from parabolic to hyperbolic SPDEs and from exponential to rational Milstein schemes. Moreover, root-mean-square error estimates are strengthened to pathwise uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the convergence rates for the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Further applications to Maxwell's and transport equations are included.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Approximations for Stationary Distributions of McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the development of unbiased estimators, to approximate the stationary distribution of Mckean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs). These are an important class of processes, which frequently appear in applications such as mathematical finance, biology and opinion dynamics. Typically the stationary distribution is unknown and indeed one cannot simulate such processes exactly. As a result one commonly requires a time-discretization scheme which results in a discretization bias and a bias from not being able to simulate the associated stationary distribution. To overcome this bias, we present a new unbiased estimator taking motivation from the literature on unbiased Monte Carlo. We prove the unbiasedness of our estimator, under assumptions. In order to prove this we require developing ergodicity results of various discrete time processes, through an appropriate discretization scheme, towards the invariant measure. Numerous numerical experiments are provided, on a range of MVSDEs, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our unbiased estimator. Such examples include the Currie-Weiss model, a 3D neuroscience model and a parameter estimation problem.</description>

      <title>High-order Accurate Inference on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for statistical inference on Riemannian manifolds that achieves high-order accuracy, addressing the challenges posed by non-Euclidean parameter spaces frequently encountered in modern data science. Our approach leverages a novel and computationally efficient procedure to reach higher-order asymptotic precision. In particular, we develop a bootstrap algorithm on Riemannian manifolds that is both computationally efficient and accurate for hypothesis testing and confidence region construction. Although locational hypothesis testing can be reformulated as a standard Euclidean problem, constructing high-order accurate confidence regions necessitates careful treatment of manifold geometry. To this end, we establish high-order asymptotics under an appropriate coordinate representation induced by a second-order retraction, thereby enabling precise expansions that incorporate curvature effects. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework across various manifold settings, including spheres, the Stiefel manifold, fixed-rank matrix manifolds, and rank-one tensor manifolds; for Euclidean submanifolds, we also introduce a class of projection-like coordinate charts with strong consistency properties. Finally, numerical studies confirm the practical merits of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>Minimisation of Quasar-Convex Functions Using Random Zeroth-Order Oracles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the performance of a random Gaussian smoothing zeroth-order (ZO) scheme for minimising quasar-convex (QC) and strongly quasar-convex (SQC) functions in both unconstrained and constrained settings. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the ZO algorithm's convergence to a global minimum along with its complexity when applied to both QC and SQC functions. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained case. Specifically, we derive complexity bounds and prove convergence of the algorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme. Beyond the theoretical guarantees, we demonstrate the practical implications of our results on several machine learning problems where quasar-convexity naturally arises, including linear dynamical system identification and generalised linear models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13815v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quasi-Monte Carlo integration demonstrate that the median of linearly scrambled digital net estimators achieves near-optimal convergence rates for high-dimensional integrals without requiring a priori knowledge of the integrand's smoothness. Building on this framework, we prove that the median estimator attains dimension-independent convergence, a property known as strong tractability in complexity theory, under tractability conditions characterized by low effective dimensionality. Using a probabilistic, integrand-specific error criterion, our analysis establishes both faster and dimension-independent convergence under weaker assumptions than previously possible in the worst-case setting.</description>

      <title>Fast prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

      <title>T-MLA: A targeted multiscale log-exponential attack framework for neural image compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural image compression (NIC) has become the state-of-the-art for rate-distortion performance, yet its security vulnerabilities remain significantly less understood than those of classifiers. Existing adversarial attacks on NICs are often naive adaptations of pixel-space methods, overlooking the unique, structured nature of the compression pipeline. In this work, we propose a more advanced class of vulnerabilities by introducing T-MLA, the first targeted multiscale log-exponential attack framework. We introduce adversarial perturbations in the wavelet domain that concentrate on less perceptually salient coefficients, improving the stealth of the attack. Extensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art NIC architectures on standard image compression benchmarks reveals a large drop in reconstruction quality while the perturbations remain visually imperceptible. On standard NIC benchmarks, T-MLA achieves targeted degradation of reconstruction quality while improving perturbation imperceptibility (higher PSNR/VIF of the perturbed inputs) compared to PGD-style baselines at comparable attack success, as summarized in our main results. Our findings reveal a critical security flaw at the core of generative and content delivery pipelines.</description>

Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</description>
