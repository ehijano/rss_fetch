      <title>Predicting temperature-dependent failure and transformation zones in 2D silica glass through quasistatic Gaussian Phase Packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The athermal quasistatic (AQS) method is a powerful technique to study the mechanical behavior of disordered systems. However, its applicability is limited to temperatures near zero, where thermal activation is unlikely. In this work, we extend the AQS method to finite temperatures, based on a formulation that describes atoms as temperature-dependent Gaussian packets (GPPs) in phase space under quasistatic conditions, thus equivalent to minimum free energy conditions. This framework is used to study the effect of temperature on the onset of inelasticity and fracture in amorphous two-dimensional silica glass approaching quasistatic conditions under uniaxial tensile loading. An important characteristic of this formulation is the directional dependence of the variance of each Gaussian packet in configuration space, making this formulation an inexpensive and accurate predictor of zones prone to atomic-scale rearrangements, both in the undeformed state and (with increasing accuracy) as the deformation progresses. This method is also shown to accurately capture the thermal expansion of the disordered material. Furthermore, combining the GPP description with Metropolis sampling predicts the effect of temperature on the onset of fracture of the material, which is validated through MD simulations at strain rates as low as $10^{4}$s$^{-1}$. The presented framework therefore provides a valuable technique for studying the nonlinear mechanics of disordered materials at finite temperature and for predicting local rearrangement zones in disordered solids efficiently without the need for expensive MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Free Fermion Dynamics with Measurements: Topological Classification and Adaptive Preparation of Topological States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and (2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime \textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state ensemble living on its temporal \textit{boundary}. Building on this correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in \textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit protocol to coherent noise.</description>

      <title>High-performance amorphous superconducting rhenium films by e-beam evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present electron beam evaporation of rhenium films on room-temperature substrates. The films are shown to be amorphous and achieve a record-high critical temperature for rhenium - exceeding 7 K at the midpoint of the transition - alongside a high critical current density of 5000 A/mm^2 and critical fields above 10 T. Terahertz spectroscopy reveals a BCS-like character of superconductivity with a zero-temperature energy gap of approximately 2 meV and subgap optical conductivity. Despite being friable, the films are stable and compatible with lift-off processes that opens the capabilities for superconducting device applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced image classification via hybridizing quantum dynamics with classical neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of quantum computing and machine learning has emerged as a promising frontier in computational science. We present a hybrid protocol which combines classical neural networks with non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum many-body system for image classification. This architecture leverages classical neural networks to efficiently process high-dimensional data and encode it effectively on a quantum many-body system, overcoming a challenging task towards scaled up quantum computation. The quantum module further capitalizes on the discriminative properties of many-body quantum dynamics to enhance classification accuracy. By mapping images from distinct classes to nearly-orthogonal quantum states, the system maximizes separability in the Hilbert space, enabling robust classification. We evaluate the performance of our model on several benchmark datasets with various number of features and classes. Moreover, we demonstrate the key role of the quantum module in achieving high classification accuracy which cannot be accomplished by the classical neural network alone. This showcases the potential of our hybrid protocol for achieving practical quantum advantage and paves the way for future advancements in quantum-enhanced computational techniques.</description>

      <title>A machine learning based approach to the identification of spectral densities in quantum open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning-based approach for characterising the environment that affects the dynamics of an open quantum system. We focus on the case of an exactly solvable spin-boson model, where the system-environment interaction, whose strength is encoded in the spectral density, induces pure dephasing. By using artificial neural networks trained on the Fourier-transformed time evolution of some observables of the system, we perform both classification -- distinguishing sub-Ohmic, Ohmic, and super-Ohmic spectral densities -- and regression -- thus estimating key parameters of the spectral density function, when the latter is expressed through a power law. Our results demonstrate high classification accuracy and robust parameter estimation, highlighting the potential of machine learning as a powerful tool for probing environmental features in quantum systems and advancing quantum noise spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Order and Parametric Instabilities from First-Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shaping crystal structure with light is an enduring goal of physics and materials engineering. Here we present calculations in candidate materials selected by symmetry that allow light-induced spatiotemporal parametric instabilities. We demonstrate a theoretical framework that includes a complete symmetry analysis of phonon modes that contribute to parametric instabilities across all non-centrosymmetric point groups, a detailed survey of the materials landscape and finally the computation of nonlinear couplings from first principles. We then showcase detailed results for chiral crystals, ferroelectrics, and layered van der Waals materials. Our results pave the way towards realizing designer time-crystalline order in quantum materials, detectable with time-resolved diffractive probes.</description>

      <title>Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of $deep$ $thermalisation$, where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles constrained only by conservation laws, represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.</description>

      <title>Thermal cycling -- evidence for a generalized tunneling model and a tool to distinguish noise sources in quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural two level systems (TLSs) ubiquitous in amorphous solids are dramatically sensitive to thermal cycling to about $20$K and then back to low temperature, a process upon which the excitation energy of most TLSs is significantly changed. Using Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not contained within the standard tunneling model, but is well explained by a model that includes an additional set of TLSs that are pseudo-gapped at low energies, yet possess strong strain interaction through which they generate significant dynamical disorder upon thermal cycling. Our results provide additional support for the broad applicability of the Two-TLS model to amorphous solids at low temperatures, bringing us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the universal behavior of phonon attenuation in these materials. With regard to quantum superconducting circuits, our results suggest thermal cycling as a unique protocol to distinguish TLS noise from other noise sources. Possible relation of the Two-TLS model to ionizing radiation effects on long-time fluctuations in qubit relaxation times and on TLS scrambling is discussed.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group analysis of noisy neural field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurons in the brain show great diversity in their individual properties and their connections to other neurons. To develop an understanding of how neuronal diversity contributes to brain dynamics and function at large scales we start with a linearized version of the Wilson-Kowan model and introduce a random anisotropy to inter-neuron connection. The resultant model is Edwards-Wilkinson model with a random anisotropic term. Averaging over the quenched randomness with the replica method we obtain a bi-quadratic nonlinearity. We use Wilsonian dynamic renormalization group to analyze this model. We find that, up to one loop order, for dimensions higher than two, the effect of the noise is to change dynamic exponent from two to one.</description>

Abstract: In 1975, two papers were published that together sparked major new directions, conceptual, mathematical and practically applicable, in several previously disparate fields of science. In this short review, we expose key aspects of their thinking, implementations and implications, along with a selection of further crucial and consequential developments. These papers were `Theory of spin glasses' by S.F.Edwards and P.W.Anderson (EA)[1] and `Solvable Model of a Spin-Glass', by D.Sherrington and S.Kirkpatrick (SK)[2], both concerned with trying to understand recent experiments that suggested a new phase of matter.</description>
