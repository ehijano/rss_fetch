      <title>A Natural Transformation between the Model Constructions of the Completeness and Compactness Theorems, Enhanced by Rigidity and 2-Categorical Strengthening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a mathematically rigorous and constructive framework that unifies two canonical model constructions in classical first order logic. In particular, we define two functors F and G from the category of consistent first order theories to the category of models. The functor F is constructed via the Henkin method, which extends any given theory to a maximal consistent theory by means of a fixed enumeration and the systematic introduction of Henkin constants, and then constructs a term model by taking the quotient of the term algebra with respect to provable equality. The functor G is obtained through a canonical compactness based construction, using either a fixed ultraproduct or a saturation procedure, ensuring that the resulting model is unique up to isomorphism.
  We prove the existence of a natural transformation eta from F to G such that each component is an isomorphism. Moreover, by leveraging the uniqueness of saturated (or prime) models in countable languages, we show that eta is rigid, meaning any other natural transformation between F and G must equal eta. Furthermore, we establish a strong natural equivalence between F and G in the two categorical sense, with eta and its inverse satisfying the required coherence conditions.
  This unification not only deepens our understanding of the interplay between proof theory and model theory, but also opens new avenues for applications in automated theorem proving, formal verification, and the study of alternative logical systems.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Integration of Logical Connectives via Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a systematic framework for integrating local categories that model logical connectives using higher category theory. By extending these local categories into a unified two-category enriched with natural isomorphisms, the universal properties of logical operations such as negation, conjunction, disjunction, and implication are rigorously captured. Advanced techniques including pseudo-limits, pseudo-colimits, and strictification are employed to transform the resulting weak structure into a strict two-category, thereby simplifying composition rules and coherence verification without loss of semantic content. The framework is validated through detailed diagrammatic proofs and concrete examples, demonstrating its robustness and potential impact in areas such as type theory, programming language semantics, and formal verification.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Propositional Logic with Strict Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Fundamental logic" is a non-classical logic recently introduced by Wesley Holliday. It has an elegant Fitch-style natural deduction system and, in a sense, it unifies orthologic and the $\{\land,\lor,\neg\}$-fragment of intuitionistic logic. In this paper, we incorporate strict implication into fundamental propositional logic (and a slightly weaker logic, respectively). We provide the axiomatization and prove the soundness and completeness theorems.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality and domination in o-minimal expansions of ordered groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse domination between invariant types in o-minimal expansions of ordered groups, showing that the domination poset decomposes as the direct product of two posets: the domination poset of an o-minimal expansion of a real closed field, and one derived from a linear o-minimal structure. We prove that if the Morley product is well-defined on the former poset, then the same holds for the poset computed in the whole structure. We establish our results by employing the `short closure' pregeometry ($\mathrm{scl}$) in semi-bounded o-minimal structures, showing that types of $\mathrm{scl}$-independent tuples are weakly orthogonal to types of short tuples. As an application we prove that, in an o-minimal expansion of an ordered group, every definable type is domination-equivalent to a product of 1-types. Furthermore, there are precisely two or four classes of definable types up to domination-equivalence, depending on whether a global field is definable or not.</description>

      <title>Bi-intuitionistic logics through the abstract algebraic logic lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of critical mistakes in Rauszer's work on bi-intuitionistic logics, solid foundations for these have progressively been rebuilt. However, the algebraic treatment of these logics has not yet been tended to. We fill this gap by algebraically analysing the bi-intuitionistic logics wBIL and sBIL. Given that these logics are only distinguished as consequence relations, and not as sets of theorems (hence the conflation in Rauszer's work), the algebraic tools we use are tailored to the treatment of such relations. We mainly inspect these logics through the lens of abstract algebraic logic, but we also provide an alternative algebraic analysis of wBIL and sBIL as logic preserving degrees of truth and truth, respectively. Our results pertaining to wBIL and sBIL are formalised in the interactive theorem prover Rocq.</description>

      <title>Distributive Laws of Monadic Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Containers are used to carve out a class of strictly positive data types in terms of shapes and positions. They can be interpreted via a fully-faithful functor into endofunctors on Set. Monadic containers are those containers whose interpretation as a Set functor carries a monad structure. The category of containers is closed under container composition and is a monoidal category, whereas monadic containers do not in general compose.
  In this paper, we develop a characterisation of distributive laws of monadic containers. Distributive laws were introduced as a sufficient condition for the composition of the underlying functors of two monads to also carry a monad structure. Our development parallels Ahman and Uustalu's characterisation of distributive laws of directed containers, i.e. containers whose Set functor interpretation carries a comonad structure. Furthermore, by combining our work with theirs, we construct characterisations of mixed distributive laws (i.e. of directed containers over monadic containers and vice versa), thereby completing the 'zoo' of container characterisations of (co)monads and their distributive laws.
  We have found these characterisations amenable to development of existence and uniqueness proofs of distributive laws, particularly in the mechanised setting of Cubical Agda, in which most of the theory of this paper has been formalised.</description>

      <title>The algebraic internal groupoid model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the model structure on the category $\mathbf{Cat}(\mathcal{E})$ of internal categories studied by Everaert, Kieboom and Van der Linden to an algebraic model structure. Moreover, we show that it restricts to the category of internal groupoids. We show that in this case, the algebraic weak factorisation system that consists of the algebraic trivial cofibrations and algebraic fibrations forms a model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory. Taking $\mathcal{E} = \mathbf{Set}$ and forgetting the algebraic structure, this recovers Hofmann and Streicher's groupoid model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory. Finally, we are able to provide axioms on a $(2,1)$-category which ensure that it gives an algebraic model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory.</description>

      <title>Classical Namba forcing can have the weak countable approximation property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that it is consistent from an inaccessible cardinal that classical Namba forcing has the weak $\omega_1$-approximation property. In fact, this is the case if $\aleph_1$-preserving forcings do not add cofinal branches to $\aleph_1$-sized trees. The exact statement we obtain is similar to Hamkins' Key Lemma. It follows as a corollary that $\mathsf{MM}$ implies that there are stationarily many indestructibly weakly $\omega_1$-guessing models that are not internally unbounded. This answers a question of Cox and Krueger and partially answers another. Our result on $\mathsf{MM}$ gives a short proof of a weakening of Cox and Krueger's main result by removing their use of higher Namba forcings, but we find another application of their ideas by answering a question of Adolf, Apter, and Koepke on preservation of successive cardinals by singularizing forcings.</description>

      <title>Good Scales and Non-Compactness of Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cummings, Foreman, and Magidor investigated the extent to which square principles are compact at singular cardinals. The first author proved that if $\kappa$ is a singular strong limit of uncountable cofinality, all scales on $\kappa$ are good, and $\square^*_\delta$ holds for all $\delta&lt;\kappa$, then $\square_\kappa^*$ holds. In this paper we will present a strongly contrasting result for $\aleph_\omega$. We construct a model in which $\square_{\aleph_n}$ holds for all $n&lt;\omega$, all scales on $\aleph_\omega$ are good, but in which $\square_{\aleph_\omega}^*$ fails and some weak forms of internal approachability for $[H(\aleph_{\omega+1})]^{\aleph_1}$ fail. This requires an extensive analysis of the dominating and approximation properties of a version of Namba forcing. We also prove some supporting results.</description>
