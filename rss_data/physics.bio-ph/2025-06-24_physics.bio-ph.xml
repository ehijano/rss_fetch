      <title>Diffusion of Tracer Particles in Early Growing Biofilms. A Computer Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of particles in complex media has gained significant interest due to its dual relevance: probing the viscoelastic properties of materials via microrheology and assessing the extent of particle displacement over time. In this work, we explore the early-stage diffusion of a tracer particle within a developing bacterial biofilm using implicit-solvent Brownian dynamics simulations. At these initial stages, bacterial colonies form two-dimensional structures that expand through cell growth and division. Employing an agent-based computational model (IbM), we analyse the passive diffusion of a spherical tracer within colonies of varying compaction levels. Our findings reveal that, at very short timescales, tracer diffusion follows a standard diffusive regime, modulated by colony ageing. However, at longer times, the dominant factor governing tracer motion is colony growth, which effectively confines the tracer within the expanding structure, except in cases where the microcolony is highly unstructured or the tracer is sufficiently small. Additionally, through MR techniques, we quantify the elastic and viscous moduli of the growing microcolony, offering insight into its evolving viscoelastic behavior.</description>

      <title>The role of dendritic spines in water exchange measurements with diffusion MRI: Time-Dependent Single Diffusion Encoding MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) with single diffusion encoding (SDE) probes water dynamics in biological tissues, but signal interpretation depends on microstructure. While prior work focused on restricted/hindered diffusion and membrane permeation, diffusion-mediated exchange between dendritic shafts and spines in gray matter (GM) remains understudied. We hypothesize that impermeable spiny dendrites produce time-dependent SDE signals mimicking permeative exchange and investigate how spine density biases exchange time estimates.
  Using Monte Carlo simulations and narrow escape theory, we quantify spine-shaft exchange times (3-26 ms), matching cortical permeative exchange estimates. A modified two-compartment Karger model characterizes time-dependent SDE signals but yields biased exchange estimates, reflecting spine volume fraction rather than morphology. Unaccounted diffusion-mediated exchange introduces up to 80% bias in NEXI/SMEX model estimates. We propose an extended three-compartment Karger model incorporating both diffusion-mediated (spine-shaft) and permeative (intra-extracellular) exchange. However, this model cannot uniquely separate membrane permeability from spine volume effects.
  Our findings emphasize that dendritic spines should be considered in SDE-based exchange studies and caution against attributing exchange solely to permeability. Advanced methods are needed to disentangle these mechanisms in GM.</description>

      <title>Identifying the sources of noise synergy and redundancy in the feed-forward loop motif</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of noise through parallel regulatory pathways is a prominent feature of feed-forward loops in genetic networks. Although the contributions of the direct and indirect regulatory pathways of feed-forward loops to output variability have been well characterized, the impact of their joint action arising from their shared input and output remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an additional component of noise that emerges specifically from this convergent nature of the pathways. Using inter-gene correlations, we reveal the regulatory basis of the additional noise and interpret it as synergy or redundancy in noise propagation, depending on whether the combined pathways amplify or suppress fluctuations. This framework not only accounts for previously observed differences in noise behavior across coherent and incoherent feed-forward loops but also provides a generalizable strategy to connect network structure with stochastic gene regulation.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical friction memory leads to subdiffusive configurational dynamics of fast-folding proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins often exhibit subdiffusive configurational dynamics. The origins of this subdiffusion are still unresolved. We investigate the impact of non-Markovian friction and the free energy landscape on the dynamics of fast-folding proteins in terms of the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the mean first-passage-time (MFPT) of the folding reaction coordinate. We find the friction memory kernel from published molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to be well-described by a hierarchical multi-exponential function, which gives rise to subdiffusion in the MSD over a finite range of time. We show that friction memory effects in fast-folding proteins dominate the scaling behavior of the MSD compared to effects due to the folding free energy landscape. As a consequence, Markovian models are insufficient for capturing the folding dynamics, as quantified by the MSD and the MFPT, even when including coordinate-dependent friction. Our results demonstrate the importance of memory effects in protein folding and conformational dynamics and explicitly show that subdiffusion in fast-folding protein dynamics originates from memory effects, not from the free energy landscape and not from coordinate-dependent friction.</description>

      <title>Static Three-Dimensional Structures Determine Fast Dynamics Between Distal Loci Pairs in Interphase Chromosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Live-cell imaging experiments have shown that the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and incompatible with standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and dynamics is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. We developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by accurately determining three-dimensional (3D) structures from static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. Using the calculated 3D coordinates, the theory accurately forecasts experimentally observed two-point chromatin dynamics. It predicts rapid enhancer-promoter interactions and uncovers a scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, closely matching recent measurements. The theory predicts that cohesin depletion accelerates single-locus diffusion while significantly slowing relaxation dynamics within topologically associating domains (TADs). Our results demonstrate that chromatin dynamics can be reliably inferred from static structural data, reinforcing the notion that 3D chromatin structure governs dynamic behavior. This general framework offers powerful tools for exploring chromatin dynamics across diverse biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Invention, Innovation, and Commercialisation in British Biophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: British biophysics has a tradition of scientific invention and innovation, resulting in new technologies transforming biological insight, such as rapid DNA sequencing, super-resolution and label-free microscopy, high-throughput and single-molecule bio-sensing, and bio-inspired synthetic materials. Some advances were established through democratised platforms and many have biomedical success, a key example involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, three UK labs made crucial contributions revealing how the spike protein targets human cells, and how therapies of vaccines and neutralizing nanobodies work, enabled largely through biophysical innovations of cryo-electron microscopy. Here, we discuss leading-edge innovations which resulted from discovery-led British 'Physics of Life' research (capturing blends of physical-life sciences research in the UK including biophysics and biological physics) and have matured into wide-reaching sustainable commercial ventures enabling translational impact. We describe the biophysical science which led to these academic spinouts, presenting the scientific questions that were addressed through innovating new techniques and approaches. We consider these examples through the lens of opportunities and challenges for academic biophysics research in partnership with British industry. We highlight how commercial breakthroughs have emerged organically from fundamental research rather than from technology-first approaches but also discuss lessons to learn from past failures. Finally, we propose recommendations concerning future resourcing and structuring of UK biophysics research and the training and support of its researchers to ensure that UK plc punches above its weight in biophysics innovation, and a need to educate the policymakers and public that an absence of basic science impoverishes innovation.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Biophysical T Cell Receptor Co-specificity Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The biophysical interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its ligands determine the specificity of the cellular immune response. However, the immense diversity of receptors and ligands has made it challenging to discover generalizable rules across the distinct binding affinity landscapes created by different ligands. Here, we present an optimization framework for discovering biophysical rules that predict whether TCRs share specificity to a ligand. Applying this framework to TCRs associated with a collection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides we systematically characterize how co-specificity depends on the type and position of amino-acid differences between receptors. We also demonstrate that the inferred rules generalize to ligands highly dissimilar to any seen during training. Our analysis reveals that matching of steric properties between substituted amino acids is more important for receptor co-specificity than the hydrophobic properties that prominently determine evolutionary substitutability. Our analysis also quantifies the substantial importance of positions not in direct contact with the peptide for specificity. These findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the specificity of adaptive immune responses.</description>

      <title>Overcoming light scattering with high optical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-resolution optical imaging deep within heterogeneous and scattering media remains a fundamental challenge in biological microscopy, where conventional techniques are hindered by multiple light scattering and absorption. Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the nonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical and spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light interference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong photoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination can be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot. This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.</description>
