      <title>Hyperuniform properties of the square-triangle tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study hyperuniform properties for the square-triangle tilings. The tiling is generated by a local growth rule, where squares or triangles are iteratively attached to its boundary. The introduction of the probability $p$ in the growth rule, which controls the expansion of square and triangle domains, enables us to obtain various square-triangle random tilings systematically. We analyze the degree of the regularity of the point configurations, which are defined as the vertices on the square-triangle tilings, in terms of hyperuniformity. It is clarified that for $p&lt;p_c \; (p_c\sim 0.5)$, the system can be regarded as a phase separation between square and triangular lattice domains and the variance of the point configurations obeys the scaling law $\sigma^2\sim O(R^{2-\alpha})$ with $\alpha&lt;0$. The configurations are antihyperuniform. On the other hand, for $p&gt;p_c$, the squares and triangles are spatially well mixed and the point configurations belong to the hyperuniform class III with the exponent $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$. This means the existence of the hyperuniform-antihyperuniform transition at $p=p_c$. We also examine the structure factor of the square-triangle tilings. It is clarified that the peak structures in the large-wave-number regime are mostly common to all square-triangle tilings, while those in the small-wave-number regime strongly depend on whether the point configurations are hyperuniform or antihyperuniform.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of percolation patterns in a kinetic replication model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model of a one-dimensional kinetic contact process with parallel update is studied by the Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling. The goal was to reveal the structure of the hidden percolative patterns (order parameters) in the active phase and the nature of transitions those patterns emerge through. Our results corroborate the earlier conjecture that in general the active (percolating) phases possess the hierarchical structure (tower of percolation patterns), where more complicated patterns emerge on the top of coexistent patterns of lesser complexity. Plethora of different patterns emerge via cascades of continuous transitions. We detect five phases with distinct patterns of percolation within the active phase of the model. All transitions on the phase diagram belong to the directed percolation universality class, as confirmed by the scaling analysis. To accommodate the case of multiple percolating phases the extension of the Janssen-Grassberger conjecture is proposed.</description>

      <title>One-body correlations and momentum distributions of trapped 1D Bose gases at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general approximate method for calculating the one-body correlations and the momentum distributions of one-dimensional Bose gases at finite interaction strengths and temperatures trapped in smooth confining potentials. Our method combines asymptotic techniques for the long-distance behavior of the gas (similar to Luttinger liquid theory) with known short-distance expansions. We derive analytical results for the limiting cases of strong and weak interactions, and provide a general procedure for calculating one-body correlations at any interaction strength. A step-by-step explanation of the numerical method used to compute Green's functions (needed as input to our theory) is included. We benchmark our method against exact numerical calculations and compare its predictions to recent experimental results.</description>

      <title>Divergence asymmetry and connected components in a general duplication-divergence graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter introduces a generalization of known duplication-divergence models for growing random graphs. This general model includes a coupled divergence asymmetry rate, which allows to obtain, for the first time, the structure of random growing networks by duplication and divergence in a continuous range of configurations between complete asymmetric divergence -- divergence rates affect only edges emanating from one of the duplicate vertices -- and symmetric divergence -- divergence rates affect equiprobably both the original and the copy vertex. Multiple connected sub-graphs (of order greater than one) emerge as the divergence asymmetry rate slightly moves from the complete asymmetric divergence case. Mean-field results of priorly published models are nicely reproduced by this general model. Moreover, in special cases, the connected sub-graph size distribution $C_s$ of networks grown by this model suggests a power-law scaling of the form $C_s \sim s^{-\lambda}$ for $s&gt;1$, e.g., with $\lambda \approx 5/3$ for divergence rate $\delta \approx 0.7$.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particle in one-dimensional potentials: mean first-passage time and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle (RTP), which is a prototypical model for active system, moving within an arbitrary external potential. Using backward Fokker-Planck equations, we derive the differential equation satisfied by its mean first-passage time (MFPT) to an absorbing target, which, without any loss of generality, is placed at the origin. Depending on the shape of the potential, we identify four distinct ``phases'', with a corresponding expression for the MFPT in every case, which we derive explicitly. To illustrate these general expressions, we derive explicit formulae for two specific cases which we study in detail: a double-well potential and a logarithmic potential. We then present different applications of these general formulae to (i) the generalization of the Kramer's escape law for an RTP in the presence of a potential barrier, (ii) the ``trapping'' time of an RTP moving in a harmonic well and (iii) characterizing the efficiency of the optimal search strategy of an RTP subjected to stochastic resetting. Our results reveal that the MFPT of an RTP in an external potential exhibits a far more complex and, at times, counter-intuitive behavior compared to that of a passive particle (e.g., Brownian) in the same potential.</description>

      <title>Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and integrable Landau-Zener models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between integrable Landau-Zener (LZ) models and Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. The latter are originally equations for the correlation functions of two-dimensional conformal field theories, but can also be interpreted as multi-time Schr\"odinger equations. The general LZ problem is to find the probabilities of tunneling from eigenstates at $t=t_\text{in}$ to the eigenstates at $t\to+\infty$ for an $N\times N$ time-dependent Hamiltonian $\hat H(t)$. A number of such problems are exactly solvable in the sense that the tunneling probabilities are elementary functions of Hamiltonian parameters and time-dependent wavefunctions are special functions. It has recently been proposed that exactly solvable LZ models map to KZ equations. Here we use this connection to identify and solve various integrable hyperbolic LZ models $\hat H(t)=\hat A+\hat B/t$ for $N=2, 3$, and $4$, where $\hat A$ and $\hat B$ are time-independent matrices. Some of these models have been considered, though not fully solved, before and others are entirely new.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the computational aspects of detecting topological order in a quantum many-body system. We contrast the widely used topological entanglement entropy with a recently introduced operational definition for topological order based on error correction properties, finding exponential scaling with the system size for the former and polynomial scaling for the latter. We exemplify our approach for a variant of the paradigmatic toric code model with mobile particles, finding that the error correction method allows to treat substantially larger system sizes. In particular, the phase diagram of the model can be successfully computed using error correction, while the topological entanglement entropy is too severely limited by finite size effects to obtain conclusive results. While we mainly focus on one-dimensional systems whose ground states can be expressed in terms of matrix product states, our strategy can be readily generalized to higher dimensions and systems out of equilibrium, even allowing for an efficient detection of topological order in current quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantifying wave propagation in a chain of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how external stimuli propagate in neural systems is an important challenge in the fields of neuroscience and nonlinear dynamics. Despite extensive studies over several decades, this problem remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine a simple "toy model" of an excitable medium, a linear chain of diffusely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons, and analyze the transmission of a sinusoidal signal injected into one of the neurons at the ends of the chain. We measure to what extent the propagation of the wave reaching the opposite end is affected by the frequency and amplitude of the signal. To quantify these effects, we measure the cross-correlation between the time-series of the membrane potentials of the end neurons.This measure allows, for instance, to detect threshold values of the parameters, delimiting regimes where wave propagation occurs or not.</description>

      <title>Multipartite information in sparse SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theories that admit gravity dual, specific inequalities involving entanglement entropy between arbitrary disjoint spatial regions hold. An example is the negativity of tripartite information. Inspired by this, we investigate the analogous entropy inequalities in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and sparse SYK models, which involve the entanglement among different flavors of Majorana fermions rather than spatial entanglement. Sparse SYK models are models where some of the SYK couplings are set to zero. Since these models have been argued to admit gravity duals up to a certain sparseness, it is interesting to see whether the multipartite entanglement structure changes in a sparseness-dependent manner. In the parameter space explored by our numerical analysis, which we performed upto five parties, we find that all entropy inequalities are satisfied for any temperature and degree of sparseness for an arbitrary choice of flavor subregions. In addition, if we plot the multipartite entanglement entropy in terms of purity, the only significant effect of sparseness is to change the range of purity. Thus, we conclude that multipartite information is almost unaffected by sparseness. As a counterexample, we also show that in a vector model of $N$-flavored Majorana fermions which contains no random variables, choices of subregions exist for which the entropy inequalities are violated.</description>

Abstract: We study the $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Lieb lattice accompanied by additional interactions that create frustration. The system exhibits a ferrimagnetic ground state in the absence of frustration. Further, we successfully observe a novel type of collapsing behavior of the ferrimagnetism via numerical diagonalization. The ferrimagnetic state is observed to collapse in a discontinuous manner. Furthermore, different ground states with small spontaneous magnetizations are obtained before the spontaneous magnetization finally disappears.</description>

      <title>Flow of supercooled liquids under dipolar force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The viscosity of supercooled liquids notably increases with decreasing temperature, leading to solidification through a glass transition. This process is accompanied by dynamic heterogeneity, characterized by persistent dynamic spatial correlations. This study investigates how dynamic heterogeneity influences the applicability of the Navier-Stokes equations to the flow of supercooled liquids. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, we subjected a two-dimensional supercooled liquid to a localized dipolar force field and compared the resulting steady velocity field with the prediction from the Navier-Stokes equations. Our approach captures a significant breakdown of the Navier-Stokes equations in real space; specifically, supercooled liquids flow more rapidly near the external force than the prediction from the Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore, this deviation is enhanced by the supercooling and is accompanied by the growth of dynamic heterogeneity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extension of thermodynamic principles to active matter remains a challenge due to the non-equilibrium nature inherent to active systems. In this study, we introduce a framework to assess entropy in our minimal macroscopic experiment based on the utilized degrees of freedom. Using motorized spheres as active particles, we demonstrate that the system transitions between distinct active states. Analogous to the phase transition in classic solids, liquids, and gases, each phase is characterized by a quantifiable change in entropy. We show that the corresponding phase transitions are accompanied by discrete jumps in entropy, resulting from newly utilized degrees of freedom. Our findings reveal that active matter can exhibit phase transitions analogous to classical thermodynamic systems, quantifiable in terms of their entropy and temperature. By bridging equilibrium thermodynamics and active matter, this work shows how underlying principles extend to complex, living systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvectors of the principal minor of dimension $n&lt; N$ of the Dyson Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ and investigate their asymptotic overlaps with the eigenvectors of the full matrix in the limit of large dimension. We explicitly compute the limiting rescaled mean squared overlaps in the large $n\,, N$ limit with $n\,/\,N$ tending to a fixed ratio $q\,$, for any initial symmetric matrix $A\,$. This is accomplished using a Burgers-type evolution equation for a specific resolvent. In the GOE case, our formula simplifies, and we identify an eigenvector analogue of the well-known interlacing of eigenvalues. We investigate in particular the case where $A$ has isolated eigenvalues. Our method is based on analysing the eigenvector flow under the Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>What do clever algorithms for glasses do? Time reparametrization at work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultraslow dynamics of glass-formers has been explained by two views considered as mutually exclusive: one invokes locally hindered mobility, the other rests on the complexity of the configuration space. Here we demonstrate that the evolution responds strongly to the details of the dynamics by changing the speed of time-flow: it has time-reparametrization softness. This finding reconciles both views: while local constraints reparametrize the flow of time, the global landscape determines relationships between different correlations at the same times. We show that modern algorithms developed to accelerate the relaxation to equilibrium act by changing the time reparametrization. Their success thus relies on their ability to exploit reparametrization softness. We conjecture that these results extend beyond the realm of glasses to the optimization of more general constraint satisfaction problems and to broader classes of algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a number of realizations of long-range interacting systems, including ultra-cold atomic and molecular gases, we study a neutral plasma with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulombic. We find that beyond a crossover length, such interactions are universally screened down to a standard Coulomb form in all spatial dimensions. This implies, counter-intuitively, that in two dimensions and below, such a "super-Coulombic" gas is asymptotically Coulombically confining at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, the plasma undergoes a deconfining transition that in two dimensions is the same Kosterlitz-Thouless transition that occurs in a conventional Coulomb gas, but at an elevated temperature that we calculate. We also predict that in contrast, above two dimensions, even when naively the bare potential is confining, there is no confined phase of the plasma at any nonzero temperature. In addition, the super-Coulomb to Coulomb crossover is followed at longer length scales by an unconventional "Debye-Huckel" screening, which leads to faster-than-Coulombic, power-law decay of the screened potential, in contrast to the usual exponentially decaying Yukawa potential. Furthermore, we show that power-law potentials, that fall off more rapidly than Coulomb, are screened down to a shorter-ranged power-law, rather than an exponential Debye-Huckel Yukawa form. We expect these prediction to be testable in simulations, and hope they will inspire experimental studies in various platforms.</description>

      <title>Universal fragmentation in annihilation reactions with constrained kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reaction-diffusion models of annihilation reactions in low dimensions, single-particle dynamics provides a bottleneck for reactions, leading to an anomalously slow approach to the empty state. Here, we construct a reaction model with a reciprocal bottleneck on particle dynamics where single-particle motion conserves the center of mass. We show that such a constrained reaction-diffusion dynamics does not approach an empty state but freezes at late times in a state with fragmented particle clusters, and that the late-time dynamics and asymptotic density are universal. Our setup thus constitutes a minimal model for the fragmentation of a one-dimensional lattice into independent particle clusters, and we provide exact results for the final density in the large-reaction rate limit. We suggest that the universal reaction dynamics could be observable in experiments with cold atoms or in the Auger recombination of exciton gases.</description>

      <title>General theory for localizing the where and when of entropy production meets single-molecule experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics apply to biophysical systems on the nanoscale as described by the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. This theory provides universal, exact relations for quantities like work, which have been verified in experiments where a fully resolved description allows direct access to such quantities. Complementary studies consider partially hidden, coarse-grained descriptions, in which the mean entropy production typically is not directly accessible but can be bounded in terms of observable quantities. Going beyond the mean, we introduce a fluctuating entropy production that applies to individual trajectories in a coarse-grained description under time-dependent driving. Thus, this concept is applicable to the broad and experimentally significant class of driven systems in which not all relevant states can be resolved. We provide a paradigmatic example by studying an experimentally verified protein unfolding process. As a consequence, the entire distribution of the coarse-grained entropy production rather than merely its mean retains spatial and temporal information about the microscopic process. In particular, we obtain a bound on the distribution of the physical entropy production of individual unfolding events.</description>

      <title>Analytical Survival Analysis of the Non-autonomous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The survival probability for a periodic non-autonomous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is calculated analytically using two different methods. The first uses an asymptotic approach. We treat the associated Kolmogorov Backward Equation with an absorbing boundary by dividing the domain into an interior region, centered around the origin, and a "boundary layer" near the absorbing boundary. In each region we determine the leading-order analytical solutions, and construct a uniformly valid solution over the entire domain using asymptotic matching. In the second method we examine the integral relationship between the probability density function and the mean first passage time probability density function. These allow us to determine approximate analytical forms for the exit rate. The validity of the solutions derived from both methods is assessed numerically, and we find the asymptotic method to be superior.</description>

      <title>Condensate Formation in a Chiral Lattice Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of condensates in a binary lattice gas in the presence of chiral interactions. These interactions differ between a given microscopic configuration and its mirror image. We consider a two dimensional lattice gas with nearest-neighbour interactions to which we add interactions involving favoured local structures that are chiral. We focus on favoured local structures that have the shape of the letter L and explore condensate formation through simulations and analytical calculations. At low temperature, this model can exhibit four different phases that are characterised by different periodic tiling patterns, depending on the strength of interactions and the chemical potential. When particle numbers are conserved, some of these phases can coexist. We analyse the structure and surface tension of interfaces between coexisting phases and determine the condensate shapes of minimal free energy. We show that these shapes can be quadrilaterals or octagons of different orientation and symmetry.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of metric tensor in thermodynamic geometry in terms of relaxation timescales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Usually, the Carnot efficiency cannot be achieved with finite power due to the quasi-static process, which requires infinitely slow operation speed. It is necessary to tolerate extra dissipation to obtain finite power. In the slow-driving linear response regime, this dissipation can be described as dissipated availability in a geometrical way. The key to this geometrical method is the thermodynamic length characterized by a metric tensor defined on the space of control variables. In this paper, we show that the metric tensor for Langevin dynamics can be decomposed in terms of the relaxation times of a system. As an application of the decomposition of the metric tensor, we show that it is possible to achieve Carnot efficiency at finite power by taking the vanishing limit of relaxation times without breaking trade-off relations between efficiency and power.</description>

      <title>Unique and Universal scaling in dynamical quantum phase transitions</title>

Abstract: Universality and scaling are fundamental concepts in equilibrium continuous phase transitions. Here, we unveil a unique and universal scaling behavior of the critical time in slowly driven dynamical quantum phase transition. Going beyond the analogy with equilibrium phase transition, we find that the critical time exhibits a power-law scaling with quenching rate and the scaling exponent is fully determined by underlining universality class. We explain this unique scaling behavior based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. This universal scaling behavior is verified to be valid not only in noninteracting single-particle system, but also in many-body interacting system, and not only in Hermitian system, but also in non-Hermitian system. Our study unravels a deep and fundamental relationship between dynamical phase transition and equilibrium phase tranition.</description>

      <title>Flow dichroism of DNA can be quantitatively predicted via coarse-grained molecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of multiscale polymer modelling to quantitatively predict DNA linear dichroism (LD) in shear flow. LD is the difference in absorption of light polarised along two perpendicular axes, and has long been applied to study biopolymer structure and drug-biopolymer interactions. As LD is orientation-dependent, the sample must be aligned in order to measure a signal. Shear flow via a Couette cell can generate the required orientation, however it is challenging to separate the LD due to changes in polymer conformation from specific interactions, e.g. drug-biopolymer. In this study, we have applied a combination of Brownian dynamics and equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations to accurately predict polymer alignment, and hence flow LD, at modest computational cost. As the optical and conformational contributions to the LD can be explicitly separated, our findings allow for enhanced quantitative interpretation of LD spectra through the use of an in-silico model to capture conformational changes. Our model requires no fitting and only five input parameters, the DNA contour length, persistence length, optical factor, solvent quality, and relaxation time, all of which have been well characterized in prior literature. The method is sufficiently general to apply to a wide range of biopolymers beyond DNA, and our findings could help guide the search for new pharmaceutical drug targets via flow LD.</description>

      <title>Dual-isometric Projected Entangled Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.</description>

Abstract: The phenomenology of the forward rate curve (FRC) can be accurately understood by the fluctuations of a stiff elastic string (Le Coz and Bouchaud, 2024). By relating the exogenous shocks driving such fluctuations to the surprises in the order flows, we elevate the model from purely describing price variations to a microstructural model that incorporates the joint dynamics of prices and order flows, accounting for both impact and cross-impact effects. Remarkably, this framework allows for at least the same explanatory power as existing cross-impact models, while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our model generates liquidity-dependent correlations between the forward rate of one tenor and the order flow of another, consistent with recent empirical findings. We show that the model also account for the non-martingale behavior of prices at short timescales.</description>
