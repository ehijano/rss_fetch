      <title>A Complexity Dichotomy for Semilinear Target Sets in Automata with One Counter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many kinds of infinite-state systems, the coverability problem has significantly lower complexity than the reachability problem. In order to delineate the border of computational hardness between coverability and reachability, we propose to place these problems in a more general context, which makes it possible to prove complexity dichotomies.
  The more general setting arises as follows. We note that for coverability, we are given a vector $t$ and are asked if there is a reachable vector $x$ satisfying the relation $x\ge t$. For reachability, we want to satisfy the relation $x=t$. In the more general setting, there is a Presburger formula $\varphi(t,x)$, and we are given $t$ and are asked if there is a reachable $x$ with $\varphi(t,x)$.
  We study this setting for systems with one counter and binary updates: (i) integer VASS, (ii) Parikh automata, and (i) standard (non-negative) VASS. In each of these cases, reachability is NP-complete, but coverability is known to be in polynomial time. Our main results are three dichotomy theorems, one for each of the cases (i)--(iii). In each case, we show that for every $\varphi$, the problem is either NP-complete or belongs to $\mathsf{AC}^1$, a circuit complexity class within polynomial time. We also show that it is decidable on which side of the dichotomy a given formula falls.</description>

      <title>Linear Hashing Is Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that hashing $n$ balls into $n$ bins via a random matrix over $\mathbf{F}_2$ yields expected maximum load $O(\log n / \log \log n)$. This matches the expected maximum load of a fully random function and resolves an open question posed by Alon, Dietzfelbinger, Miltersen, Petrank, and Tardos (STOC '97, JACM '99). More generally, we show that the maximum load exceeds $r\cdot\log n/\log\log n$ with probability at most $O(1/r^2)$.</description>

      <title>Separations between Combinatorial Measures for Transitive Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.12355v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of symmetry in Boolean functions $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ has been extensively studied in complexity theory. For example, symmetric functions, that is, functions that are invariant under the action of $S_n$, is an important class of functions in the study of Boolean functions. A function $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ is called transitive (or weakly-symmetric) if there exists a transitive group $G$ of $S_n$ such that $f$ is invariant under the action of $G$ - that is the function value remains unchanged even after the bits of the input of $f$ are moved around according to some permutation $\sigma \in G$. Understanding various complexity measures of transitive functions has been a rich area of research for the past few decades.
  In this work, we study transitive functions in light of several combinatorial measures. We look at the maximum separation between various pairs of measures for transitive functions. Such study for general Boolean functions has been going on for past many years. The best-known results for general Boolean functions have been nicely compiled by Aaronson et. al (STOC, 2021).
  The separation between a pair of combinatorial measures is shown by constructing interesting functions that demonstrate the separation. But many of the celebrated separation results are via the construction of functions (like "pointer functions" from Ambainis et al. (JACM, 2017) and "cheat-sheet functions" Aaronson et al. (STOC, 2016)) that are not transitive. Hence, we don't have such separation between the pairs of measures for transitive functions.
  In this paper we show how to modify some of these functions to construct transitive functions that demonstrate similar separations between pairs of combinatorial measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that approximate graph colouring is not solved by the lift-and-project hierarchy for the combination of linear programming and linear Diophantine equations. The proof is based on combinatorial tensor theory.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Firefighting on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a pursuit-evasion game that describes the process of extinguishing a fire burning on the nodes of an undirected graph. We denote the minimum number of firefighters required by $\text{ffn}(G)$ and provide a characterization for the graphs with $\text{ffn}(G)=1$ and $\text{ffn}(G)=2$ as well as almost sharp bounds for complete binary trees. We show that deciding whether $\text{ffn}(G) \leq m$ for given $G$ and $m$ is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that shortest strategies can have superpolynomial length, leaving open whether the problem is in NP. Based on some plausible conjectures, we also prove that this decision problem is neither NP-hard for graphs with bounded treewidth nor for constant $m$.</description>

      <title>Diversity-aware clustering: Computational Complexity and Approximation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study diversity-aware clustering problems where the data points are associated with multiple attributes resulting in intersecting groups. A clustering solution needs to ensure that the number of chosen cluster centers from each group should be within the range defined by a lower and upper bound threshold for each group, while simultaneously minimizing the clustering objective, which can be either $k$-median, $k$-means or $k$-supplier. We study the computational complexity of the proposed problems, offering insights into their NP-hardness, polynomial-time inapproximability, and fixed-parameter intractability. We present parameterized approximation algorithms with approximation ratios $1+ \frac{2}{e} + \epsilon \approx 1.736$, $1+\frac{8}{e} + \epsilon \approx 3.943$, and $5$ for diversity-aware $k$-median, diversity-aware $k$-means and diversity-aware $k$-supplier, respectively. Assuming Gap-ETH, the approximation ratios are tight for the diversity-aware $k$-median and diversity-aware $k$-means problems. Our results imply the same approximation factors for their respective fair variants with disjoint groups -- fair $k$-median, fair $k$-means, and fair $k$-supplier -- with lower bound requirements.</description>

      <title>Logic and Computation through the Lens of Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressivity and computational aspects of first-order logic and its extensions in the semiring semantics developed by Gr\"adel and Tannen. We characterize the complexity of model checking and data complexity of first-order logic both in terms of a generalization of Blum-Shub-Smale machines and arithmetic circuits defined over a semiring. In particular, we give a logical characterization of constant-depth arithmetic circuits by an extension of first-order logic that holds for any semiring that is both commutative and positive.</description>
