      <title>Using gravitational wave early warning to pre-point neutron star mergers with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration has recently made it possible for early warning alerts to be sent out, potentially before the end of the gravitational wave (GW) emission from a neutron star binary. If we get such alerts in this (the fourth) or the next observing run they may arrive up to tens of seconds before the merger, which is comparable to the slewing times of the Large Size Telescopes (designed to observe very high energy gamma rays): it would be therefore possible to point to the source right before it starts emitting an electromagnetic signal. This new mode of observation would allow us to detect the TeV component of prompt emission, which is currently poorly constrained and understood. There are many technical challenges to overcome before this can be realized: improving the synergy between gravitational observatories and telescopes, reducing operational latencies and, from the gravitational wave side, providing more information, such as real-time updates on early warning candidates and the probability distribution of the inclination angle. Although we may need to wait a few years -- in the worst case scenario, until the next generation of GW detectors is built -- before the first detection of this kind is made, implementing these improvements is a necessity.</description>

      <title>The theory of resonant cosmic ray-driven instabilities -- Growth and saturation of single modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) feedback is critical for galaxy formation as CRs drive galactic winds, regularize star formation in galaxies, and escape from active galactic nuclei to heat the cooling cores of galaxy clusters. The feedback strength of CRs depends on their coupling to the background plasma and, as such, on the effective CR transport speed. Traditionally, this has been hypothesized to depend on the balance between wave growth of CR-driven instabilities and their damping. Here, we study the physics of CR-driven instabilities from first principles, starting from a gyrotropic distribution of CR ions that stream along a background magnetic field. We develop a theory of the underlying processes that organize the particles' orbits and in particular their gyrophases, which provides an intuitive physical picture of (i) wave growth as the CR gyrophases start to bunch up lopsidedly towards the local wave magnetic field, (ii) instability saturation as a result of CRs overtaking the wave and damping its amplitude without isotropizing CRs in the wave frame, and (iii) CR back-reaction onto the unstable plasma waves as the CR gyrophases follow a pendulum motion around the wave magnetic field. Using our novel fluid-particle-in-cell code fluid-SHARP, we validate our theory on the evolution and excitation of individual unstable modes, such as forward and backward propagating Alfv\'en and whistler waves. We show that these kinetic simulations support our theoretical considerations, thus potentially foreshadowing a fundamental revision of the theory of CR transport in galaxies and galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption Events from Stripped Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) show signs of Nitrogen enrichment reminiscent of other astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies. Given that TDEs probe the gas from a single star, it is possible to test if the observed enrichment is consistent with expectations from the CNO cycle by looking at the observed Nitrogen/Carbon (N/C) abundance ratios. Given that $\approx 20\%$ of solar mass stars (and an even larger fraction of more massive stars) live in close binaries, it is worthwhile to also consider what TDEs from stars influenced by binary evolution would look like. We show here that TDEs from stars stripped of their Hydrogen-rich (and Nitrogen-poor) envelopes through previous binary-induced mass loss can produce much higher observable N/C enhancements than even TDEs from massive stars. Additionally, we predict that the time-dependence of the N/C abundance ratio in the mass fallback rate of stripped stars will follow the inverse behavior of main-sequence stars, enabling a more accurate characterization of the disrupted star.</description>

      <title>Detection of 49 Weak Dispersed Radio Pulses in a Parkes Observation of the X-ray Pulsar PSR J0537$-$6910</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I conducted a new search for dispersed radio pulses from the X-ray pulsar PSR J0537$-$6910 in the Large Magellanic Cloud in a long (11.6 hr) archival 1.4 GHz Parkes search observation. I searched dispersion measures (DMs) between 0 and 10000 pc cm$^{-3}$ and detected 49 pulses with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 7 at a wide range of DMs using the HEIMDALL and FETCH pulse detection and classification packages. All of the pulses were weak, with none having a S/N above 8.5. There was a significant excess of pulses observed in the DM range of the known pulsar population in the LMC, suggesting that these pulses may originate from LMC pulsars. Three repeat pulses, each having widths $\lesssim 1$ ms, were detected in a single DM trial of 103.412 pc cm$^{-3}$, which is in the LMC DM range. This is unlikely to occur by chance in a single DM trial in this search at the (marginally significant) 4.3$\sigma$ level. It remains unclear whether any of the detected pulses in the sample are from PSR J0537$-$6910 itself.</description>

      <title>Constraining the selection corrected luminosity function and total pulse count for radio transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying transient phenomena, such as individual pulses from pulsars, has garnered considerable attention in the era of astronomical big data. Of specific interest to this study are Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs), nulling, and intermittent pulsars. This study introduces a new algorithm named LuNfit, tailored to correct the selection biases originating from the telescope and detection pipelines. Ultimately LuNfit estimates the intrinsic luminosity distribution and nulling fraction of the single pulses emitted by pulsars. LuNfit relies on Bayesian nested sampling so that the parameter space can be fully explored. Bayesian nested sampling also provides the additional benefit of simplifying model comparisons through the Bayes ratio. The robustness of LuNfit is shown through simulations and applying LuNfit onto pulsars with known nulling fractions. LuNfit is then applied to three RRATs, J0012+5431, J1538+1523, and J2355+1523, extracting their intrinsic luminosity distribution and burst rates. We find that their nulling fraction is 0.4(2), 0.749(5) and 0.995(2) respectively. We further find that a log-normal distribution likely describes the single pulse luminosity distribution of J0012+5431 and J1538+1523, while the Bayes ratio for J2355+1523 slightly favors an exponential distribution. We show the conventional method of correcting selection effects by "scaling up" the missed fraction of radio transients can be unreliable when the mean luminosity of the source is faint relative to the telescope sensitivity. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current implementation of LuNfit while also delving into potential enhancements that would enable LuNfit to be applied to sources with complex pulse morphologies.</description>

      <title>VLBA Astrometry of the Fastest-spinning Magnetar Swift J1818.0-1607: A Large Trigonometric Distance &amp; A Small Transverse Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to being the most magnetic objects in the known universe, magnetars are the only objects observed to generate fast-radio-burst-like emissions. The formation mechanism of magnetars is still highly debated, and may potentially be probed with the magnetar velocity distribution. We carried out a 3-year-long astrometric campaign on Swift J1818.0-1607 -- the fastest-spinning magnetar, using the Very Long Baseline Array. After applying the phase-calibrating 1D interpolation strategy, we obtained a small proper motion of 8.5 $\mathrm{mas~yr^{-1}}$ magnitude, and a parallax of $0.12\pm0.02$ mas (uncertainties at $1\,\sigma$ confidence throughout the Letter) for Swift J1818.0-1607. The latter is the second magnetar parallax, and is among the smallest neutron star parallaxes ever determined. From the parallax, we derived the distance $9.4^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$ kpc, which locates Swift J1818.0-1607 at the far side of the Galactic central region. Combined with the distance, the small proper motion leads to a transverse peculiar velocity $v_\perp=48^{+50}_{-16}$ $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ -- a new lower limit to magnetar $v_\perp$. Incorporating previous $v_\perp$ estimates of seven other magnetars, we acquired $v_\perp=149^{+132}_{-68}$ $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ for the sample of astrometrically studied magnetars, corresponding to the three-dimensional space velocity $\sim190^{+168}_{-87}$ $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, smaller than the average level of young pulsars. Additionally, we found that the magnetar velocity sample does not follow the unimodal young pulsar velocity distribution reported by Hobbs et al. at $&gt;2\,\sigma$ confidence, while loosely agreeing with more recent bimodal young pulsar velocity distributions derived from relatively small samples of quality astrometric determinations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated protons produced by magnetic Penrose process in Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical mechanisms to extract energies from a rotating black hole are the Blandford-Znajek process and the Penrose process. The Penrose process requires a special condition that is difficult to occur in common astrophysical situations. However, the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) does not require such a special condition, and can produce ultra-high energy cosmic rays. When neutrons decay near a rotating black hole, the MPP efficiency of the produced proton is maximized. The supermassive black hole in Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow that is hot enough to produce neutrons by nuclear reactions, which can be subsequently accelerated to high-energy by the MPP. We calculate the production rate of accelerated protons from the Sgr A* to estimated the gamma-ray flux at Earth produced by these accelerated protons and the flux of the accelerated protons themselves transported from Sgr A* to Earth. We find that these very high-energy gamma rays ($E_{\gamma}\gtrsim10\,\mathrm{TeV}$) amount to a significant fraction of the flux of the gamma-ray from the HESS J1745-290 and the central molecular zone around $100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The accelerated proton flux, when the dimensionless spin parameter $a_{*}=0.5$ and the magnetic field strength in the vicinity of the black hole $B_{0}=100\,\mathrm{G}$, is about $1.6-4.1\%$ of the cosmic ray proton flux from KASCADE experiment at about $1\,\mathrm{PeV}$. Due to the finite decay time of neutrons which need to be transported from the accretion flow to the acceleration zone, our acceleration model can operate only around black holes with mass not much greater than $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetar transient activity in time-domain and multimessenger astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain and multimessenger astronomy (TDAMM) involves the study of transient and time-variable phenomena across various wavelengths and messengers. The Astro2020 Decadal Survey has identified TDAMM as the top priority for NASA in this decade, emphasizing its crucial role in advancing our understanding of the universe and driving new discoveries in astrophysics. The TDAMM community has come together to provide further guidance to funding agencies, aiming to define a clear path toward optimizing scientific returns in this research domain. This encompasses not only astronomy but also fundamental physics, offering insights into gravity properties, the formation of heavy elements, the equation of state of dense matter, and quantum effects associated with extreme magnetic fields. Magnetars, neutron stars with the strongest magnetic fields known in the universe, play a critical role in this context. In this manuscript, we aim to underscore the significance of magnetars in TDAMM, highlighting the necessity of ensuring observational continuity, addressing current limitations, and outlining essential requirements to expand our knowledge in this field.</description>

      <title>Diversity in Fermi/GBM Gamma Ray Bursts: New insights from Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been a long-standing puzzle in high-energy astrophysics. Recent observations challenge the traditional short vs. long viewpoint, where long GRBs are thought to originate from the collapse of massive stars and short GRBs from compact binary mergers. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been instrumental in addressing this problem, revealing five distinct GRB groups within the Swift/BAT light curve data, two of which are associated with kilonovae (KNe). We corroborate these five classes by extending this analysis to the Fermi/GBM data using unsupervised ML techniques. These five clusters are well separated in fluence-duration plane, hinting at a potential link between fluence, duration and complexities (or structures) in the light curves of GRBs. Further, we confirm two distinct classes of KN-associated GRBs. The presence of GRB 170817A in one of the two KNe-associated clusters lends evidence to the hypothesis that this class of GRBs could potentially be produced by binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The second KN-associated GRB cluster could potentially originate from NS-BH mergers. Future multimessenger observations of compact binaries in gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic waves can be paramount in understanding these clusters better.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Trace Anomaly of Supradense Matter via Neutron Star Compactness Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta\equiv 1/3-P/\varepsilon$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Based on the analytical results from perturbatively analyzing the dimensionless Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\Pi_{\rm{c}}\equiv\mathrm{X}/(1+3\mathrm{X}^2+4\mathrm{X})$ where $\mathrm{X}\equiv P_{\rm{c}}/\varepsilon_{\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\Delta_{\rm{c}}=1/3-\mathrm{X}$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-independently the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter.</description>

      <title>The JADES Transient Survey: Discovery and Classification of Supernovae in the JADES Deep Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05060v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a multi-cycle JWST program that has taken among the deepest near-infrared images to date (down to $\sim$30.5 ABmag) over $\sim$25 arcmin$^2$ in the GOODS-S field in two sets of observations with one year of separation. This presented the first opportunity to systematically search for transients, mostly supernovae (SNe), out to $z&gt;$2. We found 79 SNe: 38 at $z&lt;$2, 23 at 2$&lt;z&lt;$3, 8 at 3$&lt;z&lt;$4, 7 at 4$&lt;z&lt;$5, and 3 with undetermined redshifts, where the redshifts are predominantly based on spectroscopic or highly reliable JADES photometric redshifts of the host galaxies. At this depth, the detection rate is $\sim$1-2 per arcmin$^2$ per year, demonstrating the power of JWST as a supernova discovery machine. We also conducted multi-band follow-up NIRCam observations of a subset of the SNe to better constrain their light curves and classify their types. Here, we present the survey, sample, search parameters, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), light curves, and classifications. Even at $z\geq$2, the NIRCam data quality is such that we can perform multi-epoch light-curve fitting to classify supernovae with a reasonable degree of confidence. The multi-epoch SN sample includes a Type Ia SN at $z_{spec}= $ 2.91, Type IIP SN at $z_{spec}= $ 3.61, and a Type Ic-BL SN at $z_{spec}= $ 2.845. We also found that two $z\sim$16 galaxy candidates from the first imaging epoch were actually transients that faded in the second epoch, illustrating the possibility that moderate/high-redshift SNe could mimic high-redshift dropout galaxies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Relativistic Stripped Envelope Type Ic-BL Supernova at z = 2.83 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05076v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) and its host galaxy (JADES-GS+53.13533-27.81457) at $z = 2.83$. This SN (named SN 2023adta) was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Program. Follow-up observations with JWST/NIRSpec provided a spectroscopic redshift of $z = 2.83$ and the classification as a SN Ic-BL. The light curve of SN 2023adta matches well with other stripped envelope supernovae and we find a high peak luminosity, $M_V = -19.0 \pm 0.2$ mag, based on the distribution of best-fit SNe. The broad absorption features in its spectrum are consistent with other SNe Ic-BL 1-3 weeks after peak brightness. We measure a Ca II NIR triplet expansion velocity of $29{,}000 \pm 2{,}000$ km s$^{-1}$. The host galaxy of SN 2023adta is irregular, and modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED) indicates a metallicity of $Z = 0.35^{+0.16}_{-0.08} Z_{\odot}$. This environment is consistent with the population of low-$z$ SNe Ic-BL which prefer lower metallicities relative to other stripped envelope supernovae, and track long duration $\gamma$-ray burst (LGRB) environments. We do not identify any GRBs that are coincident with SN 2023adta. Given the rarity of SNe Ic-BL in the local universe, the detection of a SN Ic-BL at $z = 2.83$ could indicate that their rates are enhanced at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Effect of Rotation on Wave Mixing in Intermediate Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internal gravity waves (IGWs) are likely to cause mixing in stellar interiors. Studies show that the mixing by these waves changes drastically across age and mass (Varghese et al. 2023, arXiv:2211.06432). Here, we study the effect of rotation on this wave mixing by considering a 7 M$_{\odot}$ model at ZAMS and midMS. We compare the mixing profiles at a range of rotation rates ($1\times 10^{-5}$, $2\times 10^{-5}$, $3\times 10^{-5}$, $4\times 10^{-5}$ and $1\times 10^{-4}$ rad.s$^{-1}$) and observe that the mixing decreases with decreasing Rossby number. This can be attributed to the effect of rotation on convection which influences the amplitude with which the waves are excited near the convective-radiative interface.</description>

      <title>Identifying Host Galaxies of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Found by PTAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) present us with exciting opportunities for multi-messenger science. These systems are thought to form naturally in galaxy mergers and therefore have the potential to produce electromagnetic (EM) radiation as well as gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Once GWs from individually resolved SMBHBs are detected, the identification of the host galaxy will be a major challenge due to the ambiguity in possible EM signatures and the poor localization capability of PTAs. In order to aid EM observations in choosing which sources to follow up, we attempt to quantify the number of plausible hosts in both realistic and idealistic scenarios. We outline a host galaxy identification pipeline that injects a single-source GW signal into a simulated PTA dataset, uses production-level techniques to recover the signal, quantifies the localization region and number of galaxies contained therein, and finally imposes cuts on the galaxies using the binary parameters estimated from the GW search. In an ideal case, we find that the 90% credible areas span 29 deg^2 to 241 deg^2, containing about 14 to 341 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies remaining ranges from 22 at worst to 1 (the true host) at best. In a more realistic case, if the signal is sufficiently localized, the sky areas range from 287 deg^2 to 530 deg^2 and enclose about 285 to 1238 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies is 397 at worst and 27 at best. While the signal-to-noise ratio is the primary determinant of the localization area of a given source, we find that the size of the area is also influenced by the proximity of nearby pulsars on the sky and the chirp mass of the source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider null and time-like geodesics around a spherically symmetric, non-rotating Coherent Quantum Black Hole (CQBH). The classical limit of the geometry of CQBH departs from that of the Schwarzschild spacetime at short scales and depends on one parameter $R_s$ which can be interpreted as the physical radius of the 'quantum' core. We study circular orbits, photon rings, and lensing effects and compare them with the Schwarzschild metric. Using the relativistic ray-tracing code GYOTO, we produce a simulation of the shadow and show that thin accretion disks around a CQBH possess unique ring structures that distinguish them from other theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Effect of time-varying X-ray emission from stellar flares on the ionization of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-rays have significant impacts on cold, weakly ionized protoplanetary disks by increasing the ionization rate and driving chemical reactions. Stellar flares are explosions that emit intense X-rays and are the unique source of hard X-rays with an energy of $\gtrsim10$ keV in the protoplanetary disk systems. Hard X-rays should be carefully taken into account in models as they can reach the disk midplane as a result of scattering in the disk atmospheres. However, previous models are insufficient to predict the hard X-ray spectra because of the simplification in flare models. We develop a model of X-ray spectra of stellar flares based on observations and flare theories. The flare temperature and nonthermal electron emissions are modeled as functions of flare energy, which allows us to better predict the hard X-ray photon flux than before. Using our X-ray model, we conduct radiative transfer calculations to investigate the impact of flare hard X-rays on disk ionization, with a particular focus on the protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star. We demonstrate that for a flare with an energy of $\geq 10^{33}$ erg, X-ray photons with $\gtrsim 10$ keV penetrate down to the midplane to increase the ionization rates more than galactic cosmic rays. We also find that the 10-year-averaged X-rays from multiple flares could certainly contribute to the ionization at the disk midplane. These results emphasize the importance of stellar flares on the disk evolution.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Slow supernovae show cosmological time dilation out to $z \sim 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a precise measurement of cosmological time dilation using the light curves of 1504 type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey spanning a redshift range $0.1\lesssim z\lesssim 1.2$. We find that the width of supernova light curves is proportional to $(1+z)$, as expected for time dilation due to the expansion of the Universe. Assuming type Ia supernovae light curves are emitted with a consistent duration $\Delta t_{\rm em}$, and parameterising the observed duration as $\Delta t_{\rm obs}=\Delta t_{\rm em}(1+z)^b$, we fit for the form of time dilation using two methods. Firstly, we find that a power of $b \approx 1$ minimises the flux scatter in stacked subsamples of light curves across different redshifts. Secondly, we fit each target supernova to a stacked light curve (stacking all supernovae with observed bandpasses matching that of the target light curve) and find $b=1.003\pm0.005$ (stat) $\pm\,0.010$ (sys). Thanks to the large number of supernovae and large redshift-range of the sample, this analysis gives the most precise measurement of cosmological time dilation to date, ruling out any non-time-dilating cosmological models at very high significance.</description>

      <title>Discovery of An Apparent Red, High-Velocity Type Ia Supernova at z = 2.9 with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05089v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the JWST discovery of SN 2023adsy, a transient object located in a host galaxy JADES-GS$+53.13485$$-$$27.82088$ with a host spectroscopic redshift of $2.903\pm0.007$. The transient was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Photometric and spectroscopic followup with NIRCam and NIRSpec, respectively, confirm the redshift and yield UV-NIR light-curve, NIR color, and spectroscopic information all consistent with a Type Ia classification. Despite its classification as a likely SN Ia, SN 2023adsy is both fairly red (E(B-V)$\sim0.9$) despite a host galaxy with low-extinction and has a high Ca II velocity ($19,000\pm2,000$km/s) compared to the general population of SNe Ia. While these characteristics are consistent with some Ca-rich SNe Ia, particularly SN 2016hnk, SN 2023adsy is intrinsically brighter than the low-z Ca-rich population. Although such an object is too red for any low-z cosmological sample, we apply a fiducial standardization approach to SN 2023adsy and find that the SN 2023adsy luminosity distance measurement is in excellent agreement ($\lesssim1\sigma$) with $\Lambda$CDM. Therefore unlike low-z Ca-rich SNe Ia, SN 2023adsy is standardizable and gives no indication that SN Ia standardized luminosities change significantly with redshift. A larger sample of distant SNe Ia is required to determine if SN Ia population characteristics at high-z truly diverge from their low-z counterparts, and to confirm that standardized luminosities nevertheless remain constant with redshift.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: X-ray beacons at late cosmic dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS) is expected to contain ~100 quasars that emitted their light when the universe was less than a billion years old, i.e. at z&gt;5.6. By selection, these quasars populate the bright end of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and their count offers a powerful demographic diagnostic of the parent super-massive black hole population. Of the &gt;~ 400 quasars that have been discovered at z&gt;5.6 to date, less than 15 % have been X-ray detected. We present a pilot survey to uncover the elusive X-ray luminous end of the distant quasar population. We have designed a quasar selection pipeline based on optical, infrared and X-ray imaging data from DES DR2, VHS DR5, CatWISE2020 and the eRASS. The core selection method relies on SED template fitting. We performed optical follow-up spectroscopy with the Magellan/LDSS3 instrument for the redshift confirmation of a subset of candidates. We have further obtained a deeper X-ray image of one of our candidates with Chandra ACIS-S. We report the discovery of five new quasars in the redshift range 5.6 &lt; z &lt; 6.1. Two of these quasars are detected in eRASS and are by selection X-ray ultra-luminous. These quasars are also detected at radio frequencies. The first one is a broad absorption line quasar which shows significant X-ray dimming over 3.5 years, i.e. about 6 months in the quasar rest frame. The second radio-detected quasar is a jetted source with compact morphology. We show that a blazar configuration is likely for this source, making it the second most distant blazar known to date. With our pilot study, we demonstrate the power of eROSITA as a discovery machine for luminous quasars in the epoch of reionization. The X-ray emission of the two eROSITA detected quasars are likely to be driven by different high-energetic emission mechanisms a diversity which will be further explored in a future systematic full-hemisphere survey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how eccentricity affects the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We develop a fast and accurate semi-analytic method for computing the GW spectra, the distribution for the spectral fluctuations and the correlations between different frequencies. As GW emission circularizes binaries, the suppression of the signal strength due to eccentricity will be relevant for signals from wider binaries emitting at lower frequencies. Such a feature is present in the signal observed at pulsar timing arrays. We find that, when orbital decay of the SMBH binaries is driven by GWs only, the shape of the observed signal prefers highly eccentric binaries $\langle e \rangle_{2\,{\rm nHz}} = 0.83^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$. However, when environmental effects are included, the initial eccentricity can be significantly lowered yet the scenario with purely circular binaries is mildly disfavored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained overview of GR-Athena++, a general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code, that incorporates treatment of dynamical space-time, based on the recent work of (Daszuta+, 2021)[49] and (Cook+, 2023)[45].
  General aspects of the Athena++ framework we build upon, such as oct-tree based, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and constrained transport, together with our modifications, incorporating the Z4c formulation of numerical relativity, judiciously coupled, enables GRMHD with dynamical space-times.
  Initial verification testing of GR-Athena++ is performed through benchmark problems that involve isolated and binary neutron star space-times. This leads to stable and convergent results. Gravitational collapse of a rapidly rotating star through black hole formation is shown to be correctly handled. In the case of non-rotating stars, magnetic field instabilities are demonstrated to be correctly captured with total relative violation of the divergence-free constraint remaining near machine precision.
  The use of AMR is show-cased through investigation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which is resolved at the collisional interface in a merger of magnetised binary neutron stars.
  The underlying task-based computational model enables GR-Athena++ to achieve strong scaling efficiencies above $80\%$ in excess of $10^5$ CPU cores and excellent weak scaling up to $\sim 5 \times 10^5$ CPU cores in a realistic production setup. GR-Athena++ thus provides a viable path towards robust simulation of GRMHD flows in strong and dynamical gravity with exascale high performance computational infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of inelastic collisions between dark matter (DM) and heavy cosmic ray (CR) nuclei on CR propagation. We approximate the fragmentation cross-sections for DM-CR collisions using collider-measured proton-nuclei scattering cross-sections, allowing us to assess how these collisions affect the spectra of CR Boron and Carbon. We derive new CR spectra from DM-CR collisions by incorporating their cross-sections into the source terms and solving the diffusion equation for the complete network of reactions involved in generating secondary species. In a specific example with a coupling strength of $b_{\chi}=0.1$ and a DM mass of $m_{\chi}=0.1$ GeV, considering a simplified scenario where DM interacts exclusively with Oxygen, a notable modification in the Boron-to-Carbon spectrum due to the DM-CR interaction is observed. Particularly, the peak within the spectrum, spanning from $0.1$ GeV to $10$ GeV, experiences an enhancement of approximately 1.5 times. However, in a more realistic scenario where DM particles interact with all CRs, this peak can be amplified to twice its original value.Utilizing the latest data from AMS-02 and DAMPE on the Boron-to-Carbon ratio, we estimate a 95\% upper limit for the effective inelastic cross-section of DM-proton as a function of DM mass. Our findings reveal that at $m_\chi\simeq 2$ MeV, the effective inelastic cross-section between DM and protons must be less than $\mathcal{O}(10^{-32})~{\rm cm}^2$.</description>

Abstract: Sagittarius A$^\ast$ is a compact radio source at the center of the Milky Way that has not conclusively shown evidence for the presence of a relativistic jet. Nevertheless, indirect methods at radio frequencies do indicate consistent outflow signatures. Temporal shifts between features in frequency bands are known as time lags, associated with flares or outflows of the accretion system. It is possible to gain information on the emission and outflow mechanics by interpreting these time lags. By means of a combined general-relativistic magnetrohydrodynamical and radiative transfer modeling, we study the origin of the time-lags for magnetically arrested disc models at three black hole spins ($a_\ast \in \{ -0.9375, 0, 0.9375 \}$). We exclusively modeled the emission from the source across a frequency range of $\nu$ = 19-47 GHz. Our study also includes a targeted `slow light' study for one of the best-fitting `fast light' windows. We recovered the observational time-lag relations in various windows of our simulated light curves. The theoretical interpretation of these most promising time-lag windows is threefold; i) a magnetic flux eruption perturbs the jet-disc boundary and creates a flux tube, ii) the flux tube orbits and creates a clear emission feature, and iii) the flux tube interacts with the jet-disc boundary. The best-fitting windows have an intermediate (i=30$^\circ$/50$^\circ$) inclination and zero-BH-spin. The targeted `slow light' study did not yield better-fitting time-lag results, which indicates that the fast vs. slow light paradigm is often not intuitively understood and is likely influential in timing-sensitive studies. Sophisticated general-relativistic magnetrohydrodynamical models consistently capture the observational time-lag behavior, which is rooted in the complex dynamic interplay between the flux tube and coupled disk-jet system.</description>

Abstract: In high-energy astrophysical processes involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae or binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play an important role in the synthesis of nuclides. Neutrinos in these environments can experience collective flavor oscillations driven by neutrino-neutrino interactions, including coherent forward scattering and incoherent (collisional) effects. Recently, there has been interest in exploring potential novel behaviors in collective oscillations of neutrinos by going beyond the one-particle effective or "mean-field" treatments. Here, we seek to explore implications of collective neutrino oscillations, in the mean-field treatment and beyond, for the nucleosynthesis yields in supernova environments with different astrophysical conditions and neutrino inputs. We find that collective oscillations can impact the operation of the $\nu p$-process and $r$-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. The potential impact is particularly strong in high-entropy, proton-rich conditions, where we find that neutrino interactions can nudge an initial $\nu p$ process neutron rich, resulting in a unique combination of proton-rich low-mass nuclei as well as neutron-rich high-mass nuclei. We describe this neutrino-induced neutron capture process as the "$\nu$i process". In addition, nontrivial quantum correlations among neutrinos, if present significantly, could lead to different nuclide yields compared to the corresponding mean-field oscillation treatments, by virtue of modifying the evolution of the relevant one-body neutrino observables.</description>

Abstract: Till today, the nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains elusive despite all our efforts. This missing matter of the universe has not been observed by the already operating DM direct-detection experiments, but we can infer its gravitational effects. Galaxies and clusters of galaxies are most likely to contain DM trapped to their gravitational field. This leads us to the natural assumption that compact objects might contain DM too. Among the compact objects exist in galaxies, neutron stars are considered as natural laboratories, where theories can be tested, and observational data can be received. Thus, many models of DM have proposed it's presence in those stars. In particular, in the present study we focus on two types of dark matter particles, namely fermions and bosons with a mass range of [0.01-1.5] GeV and self-interaction strength in the range [10$^{-4}$-10$^{-1}$] MeV$^{-1}$. By employing the two-fluid model, we discovered a stable area in the M-R diagram of a celestial formation consisting of neutron star matter and DM that is substantial in size. This formation spans hundreds of kilometers in diameter and possesses a mass equivalent to 100 or more times the Solar mass. To elucidate, this entity resembles an enormous celestial body of DM, with a neutron star at its core. This implies that a supramassive stellar compact entity can exist without encountering any issues of stability and without undergoing a collapse into a black hole. In any case, the present theoretical prediction can, if combined with corresponding observations, shed light on the existence of DM and even more on its basic properties.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic double-peaked stripped-envelope SN 2023aew</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2023aew and our findings on its remarkable properties. This event, initially resembling a Type IIb supernova (SN), rebrightened dramatically $\sim$90 d after the first peak, at which time its spectrum transformed into that of a SN Ic. The slowly-evolving spectrum specifically resembled a post-peak SN Ic with relatively low line velocities even during the second rise. The second peak, reached 119 d after the first peak, is both more luminous ($M_r = -18.75\pm0.04$ mag) and much broader than those of typical SNe Ic or Ic-BL. Blackbody fits to SN 2023aew indicate that the photosphere shrinks throughout its observed evolution, and the second peak is caused by an increasing temperature. Bumps in the light curve after the second peak suggest interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM) or possibly accretion. We consider several scenarios for producing the unprecedented behavior of SN 2023aew. Two separate SNe, either unrelated or from the same binary system, require either an incredible coincidence or extreme fine-tuning. A pre-SN eruption followed by a SN requires an extremely powerful, SN-like eruption (consistent with $\sim$10$^{51}$ erg) and is also disfavored. We therefore consider only the first peak a true stellar explosion. The observed evolution is difficult to reproduce if the second peak is dominated by interaction with a distant CSM shell. A delayed internal heating mechanism is more likely, but emerging embedded interaction with a CSM disk should be accompanied by CSM lines in the spectrum, which are not observed, and is difficult to hide long enough. A magnetar central engine requires a delayed onset to explain the long time between the peaks. Delayed fallback accretion onto a black hole may present the most promising scenario, but we cannot definitively establish the power source.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Emission from Close-in Strange Quark Planets Around Strange Stars with Magnetic Interactions</title>

Abstract: According to the strange quark matter hypothesis, strange planets may exist, which are planetary mass objects composed of almost equal numbers of up, down and strange quarks. A strange planet can revolve around its host strange star in a very close-in orbit. When it finally merges with the host, strong gravitational wave emissions will be generated. Here the gravitational waveforms are derived for the merging process, taking into account the effects of the strange star's magnetic field on the dynamics. Effects of the inclination angle are also considered. Templates of the gravitational waveforms are derived. It is found that the magnetic interactions significantly speed up the merging process. Coalescence events of such strange planetary systems occurring in our Galaxy as well as in local galaxies can be effectively detected by current and future gravitational experiments, which may hopefully provide a new method to test the strange quark matter hypothesis and probe the magnetic field of compact stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a star orbiting a merging black-hole binary (BHB) in a coplanar triple configuration. During the BHB's orbital decay, the system can be driven across the apsidal precession resonance, where the apsidal precession rate of the stellar orbit matches that of the inner BHB. As a result, the system gets captured into a state of resonance advection until the merger of the BHB, leading to an extreme eccentricity growth of the stellar orbit. This resonance advection occurs when the inner binary has a non-zero eccentricity and unequal masses. The resonant driving of the stellar eccentricity can significantly alter the hardening rate of the inner BHB, and produce observational signatures to uncover the presence of nearby merging or merged BHBs.</description>

      <title>Expansion and Spectral Softening of the Dust Scattering Rings of GRB 221009A</title>

Abstract: Expanding X-ray halo or rings appear when short pulses of X-ray radiation from a background source are scattered by clouds of dust in the Milky Way. We study the X-ray rings of the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, detected by the {\it Swift} X-Ray Telescope. The rings center on the GRB position and their angular radii increase with time. We identify five major expanding rings, and our modeling of their expansion history suggests that they are scattered off, respectively, from five dusty clouds at distances of 0.4-13 kpc from the observer. Given an assumed prompt X-ray fluence of this GRB, the fluxes of those rings suggest that these clouds have dust grain column densities of $10^{7\sim8}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. More interestingly, our time-dependent spectral analysis of these rings show that they all experience spectral softening, i.e., getting softer as they expand, with spectral indices ranging from 2.2 to 5, consistent with what the dust scattering model predicts.</description>

      <title>Emergence hour-by-hour of $r$-process features in the kilonova AT2017gfo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral features in the optical/near-infrared counterparts of neutron star mergers (kilonovae, KNe), evolve dramatically on hour timescales. To examine the spectral evolution we compile a temporal series complete at all observed epochs from 0.5 to 9.4 days of the best optical/near-infrared (NIR) spectra of the gravitational-wave detected kilonova AT2017gfo. Using our analysis of this spectral series, we show that the emergence times of spectral features place strong constraints on line identifications and ejecta properties, while their subsequent evolution probes the structure of the ejecta. We find that the most prominent spectral feature, the 1$\mathrm{\mu}$m P Cygni line, appears suddenly, with the earliest detection at 1.17 days. We find evidence in this earliest feature for the fastest kilonova ejecta component yet discovered, at 0.40-0.45$c$; while across the observed epochs and wavelengths, the velocities of the line-forming regions span nearly an order of magnitude, down to as low as 0.04-0.07$c$. The time of emergence closely follows the predictions for Sr II, due to the rapid recombination of Sr III under local thermal equilibrium (LTE) conditions. The time of transition between the doubly and singly ionised states provides the first direct measurement of the ionisation temperature, This temperature is highly consistent, at the level of a few percent, with the temperature of the emitted blackbody radiation field. Further, we find the KN to be isotropic in temperature, i.e. the polar and equatorial ejecta differ by less than a few hundred Kelvin or within 5%, in the first few days post-merger, based on measurements of the reverberation time-delay effect. This suggests that a model with very simple assumptions, with single-temperature LTE conditions, reproduces the early kilonova properties surprisingly well.</description>

      <title>Low angular momentum general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow around rotating black holes with shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) accretion flows around Kerr black holes containing shock waves, where the disk is threaded by radial and toroidal magnetic fields. We self-consistently solve the GRMHD equations that govern the flow motion inside the disk and for the first time to our knowledge, we obtain the shock-induced global GRMHD accretion solutions around weakly as well as rapidly rotating black holes for a set of fundamental flow parameters, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($L$), radial magnetic flux ($\Phi$), and iso-rotation parameter ($F$). We show that shock properties, namely shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$), compression ratio ($R$) and shock strength ($\Psi$) strongly depends on $E$, $L$, $\Phi$, and $F$. We observe that shock in GRMHD flow continues to exist for wide range of the flow parameters, which allows us to identify the effective domain of parameter space in $L-E$ plane where shock solutions are feasible. Moreover, we examine the modification of the shock parameter space and find that it shifts towards the lower angular momentum values with increasing $\Phi$ and black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$). Finally, we compute the critical radial magnetic flux ($\Phi^{\rm cri}$) that admits shocks in GRMHD flow and ascertain that $\Phi^{\rm cri}$ is higher (lower) for black hole of spin $a_{\rm k} = 0.99$ ($0.0$) and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Dark matter particle mass and properties and axion-like dark radiation</title>

Abstract: New approaches are presented for the formation and evolution of nonlinear structures in different eras and suggest a heavy dark matter scenario with a critical particle mass of $10^{12}$GeV. Particles of this mass can have a free streaming mass equal to the particle mass and form the smallest structures among particles of any mass. In the bottom-up approach, via direct collisions, particles of this mass can form the smallest haloes (two particles) as early as $10^{-6}$s in the radiation era with a density ratio of $32\pi^2$ from the spherical collapse model. The halo mass increases to $10^8M_{\odot}$ at the matter-radiation equality, and to $10^{13}M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$. Halo growth eventually slows down due to the self-limiting effects of dark energy. In the top-down approach, the mass and energy cascades are identified that facilitate the hierarchical structure formation. A scale-independent rate of energy cascade $\varepsilon_u=10^{-7}m^2/s^3$ can be identified. The energy cascade leads to universal scalings on scales $r$, i.e. a two-thirds law for kinetic energy ($v_r^2\propto \varepsilon_u^{2/3}r^{2/3}$) and a four-thirds law for halo density ($\rho_r\propto\varepsilon_u^{2/3}G^{-1}r^{-4/3}$). By extending these scalings down to the smallest structure scale, we can estimate the particle mass $m_X=(\varepsilon_u\hbar^5G^{-4})^{1/9}=10^{12}$GeV, size $l_X=(\varepsilon_u^{-1}\hbar G)^{1/3}=10^{-13}$m, and a characteristic time $\tau_X=c^2/\varepsilon_u=10^{16}$yrs. Here $\hbar$ is the Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and c is the speed of light. The binding energy $E_X=(\varepsilon_u^5\hbar^7G^{-2})^{1/9}=10^{-9}$eV suggests a dark radiation field. The axion-like dark radiation should be produced at time $t_X=(\varepsilon_u^{-5}\hbar^2G^2)^{1/9}=10^{-6}$s with a mass of $10^{-9}$eV or a GUT scale decay constant $10^{16}$GeV and an energy density 1% of CMB photons.</description>

      <title>Quark stars with a unified interacting equation of state in regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00703v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\rightarrow 4$ limit for 4D Einstein Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations modified for 4DEGB gravity, we model the stellar structure of quark stars using a novel interacting quark matter equation of state. We find that increasing the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ or the interaction parameter $\lambda$ both tend to increase the mass-radius profiles of quark stars described by this theory, allowing a given central pressure to support larger quark stars in general. These results logically extend to cases where $\lambda &lt; 0$, in which increasing the magnitude of the interaction effects instead diminishes masses and radii. We also analytically identify a critical central pressure in both regimes, below which no quark star solutions exist due to the pressure function having no roots. Most interestingly, we find that quark stars can exist below the general relativistic Buchdahl bound and Schwarzschild radius $R=2M$, due to the lack of a mass gap between black holes and compact stars in 4DEGB. Even for small $\alpha$ well within current observational constraints, we find that quark star solutions in this theory can describe Extreme Compact Objects (ECOs), objects whose radii are smaller than what is allowed by general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the experimental constraints on the multipolar dark matter that has derivative coupling to the visible sector mediated by the Standard Model photon. The momentum dependent interaction enables them to be captured efficiently within massive celestial bodies boosted by their steep gravitational potential. This phenomena makes compact celestial bodies as an efficient target to probe such type of dark matter candidates. We demonstrate that a synergy of the updated direct detection results from DarkSide-50 and LUX-ZEPLIN together with IceCube bounds on high energy solar neutrinos from dark matter capture disfavour the viable parameter space of the dipolar dark matter scenario. Whereas, for the anapole dark matter scenario, a narrow window survives that lies within the reach of prospective heating signals due to the capture of dark matter at cold neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: In astronomy, we frequently face the decision problem: does this data contain a signal? Typically, a statistical approach is used, which requires a threshold. The choice of threshold presents a common challenge in settings where signals and noise must be delineated, but their distributions overlap. Gravitational-wave astronomy, which has gone from the first discovery to catalogues of hundreds of events in less than a decade, presents a fascinating case study. For signals from colliding compact objects, the field has evolved from a frequentist to a Bayesian methodology. However, the issue of choosing a threshold and validating noise contamination in a catalogue persists. Confusion and debate often arise due to the misapplication of statistical concepts, the complicated nature of the detection statistics, and the inclusion of astrophysical background models. We introduce Conformal Prediction (CP), a framework developed in Machine Learning to provide distribution-free uncertainty quantification to point predictors. We show that CP can be viewed as an extension of the traditional statistical frameworks whereby thresholds are calibrated such that the uncertainty intervals are statistically rigorous and the error rate can be validated. Moreover, we discuss how CP offers a framework to optimally build a meta-pipeline combining the outputs from multiple independent searches. We introduce CP with a toy cosmic-ray detector, which captures the salient features of most astrophysical search problems and allows us to demonstrate the features of CP in a simple context. We then apply the approach to a recent gravitational-wave Mock Data Challenge using multiple search algorithms for compact binary coalescence signals in interferometric gravitational-wave data. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the future potential of the method for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Application of hydrostatic local thermodynamic equilibrium atmosphere models to interpretations of supersoft X-ray source spectra</title>

Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with stable or recurrent thermonuclear burning on their surfaces. High-resolution X-ray spectra of such objects are rather complex, often consist of several components, and are difficult to interpret accurately. The main emission source is the hot surface of the WD and the emergent radiation can potentially be described by hot WD model atmospheres. We present a new set of such model atmosphere spectra computed in the effective temperature range from $100\rm\,kK$ to $1000\rm\,kK$, for eight values of surface gravity and three different chemical compositions. These compositions correspond to the solar one as well as to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, with decreased heavy element abundances, at one-half and one-tenth of the solar value. The presented model grid covers a broad range of physical parameters and, thus, it can be applied to a wide range of objects. It is also publicly available in XSPEC~format. As an illustration, we applied it here for the interpretation of \textit{Chandra} and XMM grating spectra of two classical SSSs, namely, CAL 83 (RX J0543.5$-$6823) and RX J0513.9$-$6951. The obtained effective temperatures and surface gravities of $T_{\rm eff} \approx 560$ kK, $\log g \approx 8.6-8.7$, and $T_{\rm eff} \approx 630\,{\rm kK}, \log g \approx 8.5-8.6$, respectively, are in a good agreement with previous estimations for both sources. The derived WD~mass estimations are within $1.1-1.4\,M_\odot$ for CAL 83 and $1.15-1.4\,M_\odot$ for RX J0513.9$-$6951. The mass of the WD in CAL $83$ is consistent with the mass predicted from the respective model of recurrent thermonuclear burning.</description>
