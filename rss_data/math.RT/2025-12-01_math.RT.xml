      <title>Geometric realizations of Ringel-Hall algebras of continuous quivers of type $A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lusztig introduced the geometric realizations of quantum groups associated to finite quivers and defined their canonical bases. Sala and Schiffmann introduced the Ringel-Hall algebra of line and realized it as the direct limit of Ringel-Hall algebras of finite quivers of type $A$. In this paper, we shall give geometric realizations of Ringel-Hall algebras of continuous quivers of type $A$ via the geometric realizations of Lusztig by using the method of approximation given by Sala and Schiffmann.</description>

      <title>Differential graded algebras with divided powers and homotopy Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a commutative ring $R$ and a quotient module $R/\mathfrak{m}$, we study the structure of differential graded algebra with divided powers that the resolution of $R/\mathfrak{m}$ can possess. We provide a construction of such a resolution by making use of symmetric tensors, which does not require a Noetherian assumption on $R$. We then apply those results to study the homotopy Lie algebra associated to a the pair $(R,R/\mathfrak{m})$, and then investigate in more details the complete intersection case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a geometric account of Harish-Chandra's principle that a tempered irreducible representation of a real reductive group is either square-integrable modulo center, or embeddable in a representation that is parabolically induced from such a representation. Our approach uses the Satake compactification, an associated groupoid that was constructed in the first paper of this series, and its $C^*$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Lie groupoids, the Satake compactification and the tempered dual, I: The Satake groupoid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (maximal) Satake compactification associated to a real reductive group $G$ is the closure of the symmetric space of all maximal compact subgroups of $G$ within the compact space of all closed subgroups of $G$. We shall present three different views of a groupoid that may be associated to the Satake compactification. To begin, we shall define our Satake groupoid, as we shall call it, as a topological groupoid, and as a special case of a general construction of Omar Mohsen. Then we shall give a Lie-theoretic account of the Satake groupoid, borrowing from work of Toshio Oshima. Finally we shall identify the Satake groupoid with the purely geometric $b$-groupoid of the Satake compactification, using the structure of the compactification as a smooth manifold with corners. In a subsequent paper we shall use the Satake groupoid to present a new proof of Harish-Chandra's principle, that all the tempered irreducible representations of $G$ may be constructed from discrete series representations using parabolic induction.</description>

      <title>Replicated algebras derived equivalent to higher Auslander algebras of type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every higher Auslander algebra $A_{n+1}^d$ of type $\mathbb{A}$ such that $\gcd(n,d)=1$ is derived equivalent to a certain replicated algebra $B=B_0^{(n+d)}$. Moreover ${\rm{gldim}} B = nd$ and $B$ admits an $nd$-cluster tilting subcategory consisting of all direct sums of projective modules and injective modules. We introduce a class of algebras called $2$-subhomogeneous $m$-representation finite to characterize the homological properties of $B$ and give a method to obtain derived equivalences between fractionally Calabi-Yau algebras and $2$-subhomogeneous algebras using certain tilting complexes.</description>

      <title>Quadratic exchange equations for Coxeter matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropicalisation (with trivial coefficients) is a process that turns a polynomial equation into a combinatorial predicate on subsets of the set of variables. We show that for each minuscule representation of a simple reductive group, there is a set of quadratic equations cutting out the orbit of the highest weight vector whose tropicalisation characterises the set of Coxeter matroids for that representation which satisfy the strong exchange property.</description>

      <title>Residues of Rankin-Selberg Zeta integrals and the split non-tempered Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a regularization of the Rankin-Selberg period on general linear groups for non-tempered automorphic representations using residues of Zeta integrals. We prove that it satisfies the global non-tempered Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture and its Ichino-Ikeda refinement. We also build a local version of our regularization and show that it defines a non-zero invariant linear form on non-tempered representations. Combined with previous works of Chan, Chen and Chen, this settles the conjectures over local fields of characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.
  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.
  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Addition Formulas of the KP hierarchy and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that tau functions of the KP hierarchy satisfy addition formulas. We consider the general addition formula in the determinant form and take a certain limit of it. It expresses certain shifts of a tau function in terms of the Wronskian determinants of wave functions at various values of the spectral parameter. As an application the relation between solutions created by vertex operators and those created by Darboux transformations is clarified. As another application the new addition formula for Riemann's theta functions of Riemann surfaces is obtained by considering theta function solutions of the KP hierarchy. This addition formula is different from any of formulas in Fay's book.</description>

      <title>Quantum Matrix Spherical Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general theory of matrix-spherical functions for dual Hopf algebras and right coideal subalgebras is developed. We establish their existence and define their orthogonality relations. When specialized to Kolb and Letzter's quantum symmetric pair coideal subalgebras, we associate, to each classical commutative triple, a unique corresponding quantum commutative triple. This leads to families of vector-valued orthogonal polynomials, which diagonalize a commutative algebra of difference-reflection operators and are invariant under sending $q \mapsto q^{-1}$. Various examples of these vector-valued orthogonal polynomials are given and identified with Intermediate Macdonald polynomials</description>

      <title>Exchange matrices of I-boxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Admissible chains of i-boxes are important combinatorial tools in the monoidal categorification of cluster algebras, as they provide seeds of the cluster algebra. In this paper, we explore the properties of maximal commuting families of i-boxes in a more general setting, and define a certain matrix associated with such a family, which we call the exchange matrix. It turns out that, when considering the cluster algebra structure on the Grothendieck rings, this matrix is indeed the exchange matrix of the seed associated with the family, both in certain categories of modules over quantum affine algebras and over quiver Hecke algebras. We prove this by constructing explicit short exact sequences that represent the mutation relations.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures via representation theory: cluster ensembles, tropical duality, cluster characters and quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of cluster categories, applying to a 2-Calabi-Yau extriangulated category $\mathcal{C}$ and cluster-tilting subcategory $\mathcal{T}$ satisfying only mild finiteness conditions. We show that the structure theory of $\mathcal{C}$ and the representation theory of $\mathcal{T}$ give rise to the rich combinatorial structures of seed data and cluster ensembles, via Grothendieck groups and homological algebra. We demonstrate that there is a natural dictionary relating cluster-tilting subcategories and their tilting theory to A-side tropical cluster combinatorics and, dually, relating modules over $\underline{\mathcal{T}}$ to the X-side; here $\underline{\mathcal{T}}$ is the image of $\mathcal{T}$ in the triangulated stable category of $\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, the exchange matrix associated to $\mathcal{T}$ arises from a natural map $p_{\mathcal{T}}\colon\mathrm{K}_0(\operatorname{mod}\underline{\mathcal{T}})\to\mathrm{K}_0(\mathcal{T})$ closely related to taking projective resolutions.
  Via our approach, we categorify many key identities involving mutation, g-vectors and c-vectors, including in infinite rank cases and in the presence of loops and 2-cycles. We are also able to define A- and X-cluster characters, which yield A- and X-cluster variables when there are no loops or 2-cycles, and which enable representation-theoretic proofs of cluster-theoretical statements.
  Continuing with the same categorical philosophy, we give a definition of a quantum cluster category, as a cluster category together with the choice of a map closely related to the adjoint of $p_{\mathcal{T}}$. Our framework enables us to show that any Hom-finite exact cluster category admits a canonical quantum structure, generalising results of Gei{\ss}--Leclerc--Schr\"oer.</description>

      <title>Total trades, intersection matrices and Specht modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trades are important objects in combinatorial design theory that may be realized as certain elements of kernels of inclusion matrices. Total trades were introduced recently by Ghorbani, Kamali and Khosravshahi, who showed that over a field of characteristic zero the vector space of trades decomposes into a direct sum of spaces of total trades. In this paper, we show that the vector space spanned by the permutations of a total trade is an irreducible representation of the symmetric group. As a corollary, the previous decomposition theorem is recovered. Also, a basis is obtained for the module of total trades in the spirit of Specht polynomials. More generally, in the second part of the paper we consider intersection matrices and determine the irreducible decompositions of their images. This generalizes previously known results concerning ranks of special cases.</description>

In characteristic zero, we give a birational classification of exponential matrices of size $n$-by-$n$ $(n \geq 2)$, which consists of two types. And in positive characteristic, we give birational classifications of exponential matrices of sizes two-by-two and three-by-three, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of Alesker's Irreducibility Theorem. We first introduce a new localization technique for polynomial valuations on convex bodies, which we use to independently prove that smooth and translation invariant valuations are representable by integration with respect to the normal cycle. This allows us to reduce the statement to a corresponding result for the representation of $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$ on the space of these differential forms.</description>
