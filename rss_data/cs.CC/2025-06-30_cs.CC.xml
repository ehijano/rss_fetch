      <title>Nets-within-Nets through the Lens of Data Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elementary Object Systems (EOSs) are a model in the nets-within-nets (NWNs) paradigm, where tokens in turn can host standard Petri nets. We study the complexity of the reachability problem of EOSs when subjected to non-deterministic token losses. It is known that this problem is equivalent to the coverability problem with no lossiness of conservative EOSs (cEOSs). We precisely characterize cEOS coverability into the framework of data nets, whose tokens carry data from an infinite domain. Specifically, we show that cEOS coverability is equivalent to the coverability of an interesting fragment of data nets that extends beyond $\nu$PNs (featuring globally fresh name creation), yet remains less expressive than Unordered Data Nets (featuring lossy name creation as well as powerful forms of whole-place operations and broadcasts). This insight bridges two apparently orthogonal approaches to PN extensions, namely data nets and NWNs. At the same time, it enables us to analyze cEOS coverability taking advantage of known results on data nets. As a byproduct, we immediately get that the complexity of cEOS coverability lies between $\mathbf{F}_{\omega 2}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{\omega^\omega}$, two classes beyond Primitive Recursive.</description>

      <title>Is it easier to count communities than find them?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random graph models with community structure have been studied extensively in the literature. For both the problems of detecting and recovering community structure, an interesting landscape of statistical and computational phase transitions has emerged. A natural unanswered question is: might it be possible to infer properties of the community structure (for instance, the number and sizes of communities) even in situations where actually finding those communities is believed to be computationally hard? We show the answer is no. In particular, we consider certain hypothesis testing problems between models with different community structures, and we show (in the low-degree polynomial framework) that testing between two options is as hard as finding the communities.
  Our methods give the first computational lower bounds for testing between two different ``planted'' distributions, whereas previous results have considered testing between a planted distribution and an i.i.d. ``null'' distribution. We also show a formal relationship between the low--degree frameworks for recovery in a planted model and for testing two planted models.</description>

      <title>Benford's Law from Turing Ensembles and Integer Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the information-theoretic and mathematical foundations of Benford's law, an important case of a statistical relationship that appears to constrain the information-theoretic behavior of numbers. In the present analysis we seek to deduce a general cause for Benford-like distributions to arise. We posit that they both follow from optimality and renormalization as applied to information-theoretical functionals. We also perform computational experiments that corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Concurrency Constrained Scheduling with Tree-Like Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates concurrency-constrained scheduling problems, where the objective is to construct a schedule for a set of jobs subject to concurrency restrictions. Formally, we are given a conflict graph $G$ defined over a set of $n$ jobs, where an edge between two jobs in $G$ indicates that these jobs cannot be executed concurrently. Each job may have distinct attributes, such as processing time, due date, weight, and release time. The goal is to determine a schedule that optimizes a specified scheduling criterion while adhering to all concurrency constraints. This framework offers a versatile model for analyzing resource allocation problems where processes compete for shared resources, such as access to shared memory. From a theoretical perspective, it encompasses several classical graph coloring problems, including Chromatic Number, Sum Coloring, and Interval Chromatic Number.
  Given that even the simplest concurrency-constrained scheduling problems are NP-hard for general conflict graphs, this study focuses on conflict graphs with bounded treewidth. Our results establish a dichotomy: Some problems in this setting can be solved in FPT time, while others are shown to be XALP-complete for treewidth as parameter. Along the way, we generalize several previously known results on coloring problems for bounded treewidth graphs. Several of the FPT algorithms are based on the insight that completion times are bounded by the Grundy number of the conflict graph - the fact that this number is bounded by the product of treewidth and the logarithm of the number of vertices then leads to the FPT time bound.</description>
