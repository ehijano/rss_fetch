      <title>Coordinating Planning and Tracking in Layered Control Policies via Actor-Critic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm to jointly train (1) a trajectory planner and (2) a tracking controller in a layered control architecture. Our algorithm arises naturally from a rewrite of the underlying optimal control problem that lends itself to an actor-critic learning approach. By explicitly learning a \textit{dual} network to coordinate the interaction between the planning and tracking layers, we demonstrate the ability to achieve an effective consensus between the two components, leading to an interpretable policy. We theoretically prove that our algorithm converges to the optimal dual network in the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting and empirically validate its applicability to nonlinear systems through simulation experiments on a unicycle model.</description>

      <title>Real-time Hybrid System Identification with Online Deterministic Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a real-time identification method for discrete-time state-dependent switching systems in both the input--output and state-space domains. In particular, we design a system of adaptive algorithms running in two timescales; a stochastic approximation algorithm implements an online deterministic annealing scheme at a slow timescale and estimates the mode-switching signal, and an recursive identification algorithm runs at a faster timescale and updates the parameters of the local models based on the estimate of the switching signal. We first focus on piece-wise affine systems and discuss identifiability conditions and convergence properties based on the theory of two-timescale stochastic approximation. In contrast to standard identification algorithms for switched systems, the proposed approach gradually estimates the number of modes and is appropriate for real-time system identification using sequential data acquisition. The progressive nature of the algorithm improves computational efficiency and provides real-time control over the performance-complexity trade-off. Finally, we address specific challenges that arise in the application of the proposed methodology in identification of more general switching systems. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Composite Learning Adaptive Control without Excitation Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on excitation collection and composite learning adaptive control design for uncertain nonlinear systems. By adopting the spectral decomposition technique, a linear regression equation is constructed to collect previously appeared excitation information, establishing a relationship between unknown parameters and the system's historical data. A composite learning term, developed using the linear regression equation, is incorporating into the Lyapunov-based parameter update law. In comparison to the existing results, all spectrums of previously appeared excitation information are collected, with the matrices in linear regression equation guaranteed to be bounded. This paper introduces concepts of excited and unexcited subspaces for analyzing the parameter estimation errors, and a novel Lyapunov function is developed for stability analysis. It is demonstrated that, without imposing any excitation condition, the state and excited parameter estimation error component converge to zero, while the unexcited component remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Safety with Control BarrierFunctions and Triggered Batch Least-Squares Identifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a triggered Batch Least-Squares Identifier (BaLSI) based adaptive safety control scheme is proposed for uncertain systems with potentially conflicting control objectives and safety constraints. A relaxation term is added to the Quadratic Programs (QP) combining the transformed Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), to mediate the potential conflict. The existing Lyapunov-based adaptive schemes designed to guarantee specific properties of the Lyapunov functions, may grow unboundedly under the effects of the relaxation term. The adaptive law is designed by processing system inputs and outputs, to avoid unbounded estimates and overparameterization problems in the existing results. A safetytriggered condition is presented, based on which the forward invariant property of the safe set is shown and Zeno behavior can be excluded. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive control scheme.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Weighted-Median Opinion Dynamics with Prejudice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model introduces prejudice into the opinion evolution and has been successfully validated in many practical scenarios; however, due to its weighted average mechanism, only one prejudiced agent can always guide all unprejudiced agents synchronizing to its prejudice under the connected influence network, which may not be in line with some social realities. To fundamentally address the limitation of the weighted average mechanism, a weighted-median opinion dynamics has been recently proposed; however, its theoretical analysis is challenging due to its nonlinear nature. This paper studies the weighted-median opinion dynamics with prejudice, and obtains the convergence and convergence rate when all agents have prejudice, and a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic consensus when a portion of agents have prejudice. These results are the first time to analyze the discrete-time and synchronous opinion dynamics with the weighted median mechanism, and address the phenomenon of the FJ model that connectivity leads to consensus when a few agents with the same prejudice join in an unprejudiced group.</description>

      <title>Isolating Signatures of Cyberattacks under Stressed Grid Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a controlled cyber-physical network, such as a power grid, any malicious data injection in the sensor measurements can lead to widespread impact due to the actions of the closed-loop controllers. While fast identification of the attack signatures is imperative for reliable operations, it is challenging to do so in a large dynamical network with tightly coupled nodes. A particularly challenging scenario arises when the cyberattacks are strategically launched during a grid stress condition, caused by non-malicious physical disturbances. In this work, we propose an algorithmic framework -- based on Koopman mode (KM) decomposition -- for online identification and visualization of the cyberattack signatures in streaming time-series measurements from a power network. The KMs are capable of capturing the spatial embedding of both natural and anomalous modes of oscillations in the sensor measurements and thus revealing the specific influences of cyberattacks, even under existing non-malicious grid stress events. Most importantly, it enables us to quantitatively compare the outcomes of different potential cyberattacks injected by an attacker. The performance of the proposed algorithmic framework is illustrated on the IEEE 68-bus test system using synthetic attack scenarios. Such knowledge regarding the detection of various cyberattacks will enable us to devise appropriate diagnostic scheme while considering varied constraints arising from different attacks.</description>

      <title>Latency-Aware Resource Allocation for Mobile Edge Generation and Computing via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the integration of mobile edge computing (MEC) and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technology has given rise to a new area called mobile edge generation and computing (MEGC), which offers mobile users heterogeneous services such as task computing and content generation. In this letter, we investigate the joint communication, computation, and the AIGC resource allocation problem in an MEGC system. A latency minimization problem is first formulated to enhance the quality of service for mobile users. Due to the strong coupling of the optimization variables, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to solve it efficiently. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve lower latency than two baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Extra Throughput versus Days Lost in load-shifting V2G services: Influence of dominant degradation mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) batteries are often underutilized. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services can tap into this unused potential, but increased battery usage may lead to more degradation and shorter battery life. This paper substantiates the advantages of providing load-shifting V2G services when the battery is aging, primarily due to calendar aging mechanisms (active degradation mechanisms while the battery is not used). After parameterizing a physics-based digital-twin for three different dominant degradation patterns within the same chemistry (NMC), we introduce a novel metric for evaluating the benefit and associated harm of V2G services: \textit{throughput gained versus days lost (TvD)} and show its strong relationship to the ratio of loss of lithium inventory (LLI) due to calendar aging to the total LLI ($\text{LLI}_\text{Cal}/\text{LLI}$). Our results that focus systematically on degradation mechanisms via lifetime simulation of digital-twins significantly expand prior work that was primarily concentrating on quantifying and reducing the degradation of specific cells by probing their usage and charging patterns. Examining various cell chemistries and conditions enables us to take a broader view and determine whether a particular battery pack is appropriate for load-shifting (V2G) services. Our research demonstrates that the decision "to V2G or not to V2G" can be made by merely estimating the portion of capacity deterioration caused by calendar aging. Specifically, TvD is primarily influenced by the chemistry of cells and the environmental temperature where the car is parked, while the usage intensity and charging patterns of EVs play a lesser role.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Traffic-Responsive Tilt Camera Surveillance through Predictive Correlated Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In urban traffic management, the primary challenge of dynamically and efficiently monitoring traffic conditions is compounded by the insufficient utilization of thousands of surveillance cameras along the intelligent transportation system. This paper introduces the multi-level Traffic-responsive Tilt Camera surveillance system (TTC-X), a novel framework designed for dynamic and efficient monitoring and management of traffic in urban networks. By leveraging widely deployed pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), TTC-X overcomes the limitations of a fixed field of view in traditional surveillance systems by providing mobilized and 360-degree coverage. The innovation of TTC-X lies in the integration of advanced machine learning modules, including a detector-predictor-controller structure, with a novel Predictive Correlated Online Learning (PiCOL) methodology and the Spatial-Temporal Graph Predictor (STGP) for real-time traffic estimation and PTC control. The TTC-X is tested and evaluated under three experimental scenarios (e.g., maximum traffic flow capture, dynamic route planning, traffic state estimation) based on a simulation environment calibrated using real-world traffic data in Brooklyn, New York. The experimental results showed that TTC-X captured over 60\% total number of vehicles at the network level, dynamically adjusted its route recommendation in reaction to unexpected full-lane closure events, and reconstructed link-level traffic states with best MAE less than 1.25 vehicle/hour. Demonstrating scalability, cost-efficiency, and adaptability, TTC-X emerges as a powerful solution for urban traffic management in both cyber-physical and real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Perturbation-based Non-Convex Optimization over Time-Varying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized optimization strategies are helpful for various applications, from networked estimation to distributed machine learning. This paper studies finite-sum minimization problems described over a network of nodes and proposes a computationally efficient algorithm that solves distributed convex problems and optimally finds the solution to locally non-convex objective functions. In contrast to batch gradient optimization in some literature, our algorithm is on a single-time scale with no extra inner consensus loop. It evaluates one gradient entry per node per time. Further, the algorithm addresses link-level nonlinearity representing, for example, logarithmic quantization of the exchanged data or clipping of the exchanged data bits. Leveraging perturbation-based theory and algebraic Laplacian network analysis proves optimal convergence and dynamics stability over time-varying and switching networks. The time-varying network setup might be due to packet drops or link failures. Despite the nonlinear nature of the dynamics, we prove exact convergence in the face of odd sign-preserving sector-bound nonlinear data transmission over the links. Illustrative numerical simulations further highlight our contributions.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based input-augmented Koopman modeling and predictive control of nonlinear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman-based modeling and model predictive control have been a promising alternative for optimal control of nonlinear processes. Good Koopman modeling performance significantly depends on an appropriate nonlinear mapping from the original state-space to a lifted state space. In this work, we propose an input-augmented Koopman modeling and model predictive control approach. Both the states and the known inputs are lifted using two deep neural networks (DNNs), and a Koopman model with nonlinearity in inputs is trained within the higher-dimensional state-space. A Koopman-based model predictive control problem is formulated. To bypass non-convex optimization induced by the nonlinearity in the Koopman model, we further present an iterative implementation algorithm, which approximates the optimal control input via solving a convex optimization problem iteratively. The proposed method is applied to a chemical process and a biological water treatment process via simulations. The efficacy and advantages of the proposed modeling and control approach are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Real-time Trajectory Optimization of Impaired Aircraft based on Steady State Manoeuvres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aircraft failures alter dynamics, diminishing manoeuvrability. Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared. Results show that the near-optimal real-time trajectory retains up to 80% of the optimality.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Communication Compression in Distributed Prime-Dual Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study distributed prime-dual flows for multi-agent optimization with spatio-temporal compressions. The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Formulation of a 3 DOF Compliant Mechanism using Sylvester Dialytic Method of Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the equilibrium formulation of a three degree of freedom planar compliant platform mechanism, which is in contact with a solid body in its environment. The mechanism includes two platforms, which are connected in parallel by three linear springs. The capability of deformation by manipulating both platforms exceptionally complicates the problem. The analysis aims to determine all equilibrium configurations for two different cases: FIRST CASE all three springs have zero free lengths and SECOND CASE only two of the springs have zero free lengths. The proposed procedure calculates the pose of the top platform when it is not in contact with the surface, and then detects if the top platform is in contact to determine the equilibrium configurations. To solve the geometric equations of the mechanism, we use Sylvester method of elimination. The approach obtains 4th and 48th degree polynomial equations for the first and second cases, respectively. Numerical examples have been applied to verify the process of analysis. The results, which are numerically calculated by software Maple, prove the validity of the analysis.</description>

      <title>Global Observability Analysis of a Growth Model for Insects Farming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hermetia illucens insects or the black soldier fly has been attracting a growing interest in the food and feed industry. For its high nutritional value on the one hand, and because it is an adequate species for insects in controlled environmental agriculture systems, on the other. Therefore, several models describing this larvae's behaviour have been developed in the literature. Due to the complex nature of living organisms, systems of controlled environment agriculture are characterised by their strong nonlinearities. In this paper, we present a three dimensional nonlinear model describing the black soldier fly dry biomass weight dynamic changes due to the temperature's influence. In practice, this biomass weight is not measured in real time. This becomes problematic for applying feedback control strategies that assume full information of the states. Thus, this work investigates the observability of the dry biomass of a Hermetia illucens farming batch. The instantaneous and global observability of the aforementioned model is proven by constructing an injective transformation between the state space and a higher dimensional space where the transformed states are observable.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the analysis and implementation of the Virtual Oscillator Control (VOC) strategy for inverters aiming to enhance stability amidst the ever-increasing generation of renewable energy sources like solar PV. Key objectives include implementation and analysis of a Dead-Zone VOC (DZVOC) three-phase battery-inverter system with an additional voltage control loop, study of its stability and performance in an isolated micro-grid and exploration of their use alongside widely used grid following PV-inverter system. By modeling independent microgrids under various cases with scenarios: VOC inverters of varying capacities and VOC inverters in conjunction with PV inverters, this research addresses critical aspects of power-sharing, compatibility, response times, and fault ride-through potential, as well as improving the voltage droop profile of a general DZVOC control. The simulation is executed in MATLAB SIMULINK and validated with real-time simulation using the Typhoon-HIL 404.</description>

      <title>Generative AI as a Service in 6G Edge-Cloud: Generation Task Offloading by In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is a promising technique towards 6G networks, and generative foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have attracted considerable interest from academia and telecom industry. This work considers a novel edge-cloud deployment of foundation models in 6G networks. Specifically, it aims to minimize the service delay of foundation models by radio resource allocation and task offloading, i.e., offloading diverse content generation tasks to proper LLMs at the network edge or cloud. In particular, we first introduce the communication system model, i.e., allocating radio resources and calculating link capacity to support generated content transmission, and then we present the LLM inference model to calculate the delay of content generation. After that, we propose a novel in-context learning method to optimize the task offloading decisions. It utilizes LLM's inference capabilities, and avoids the difficulty of dedicated model training or fine-tuning as in conventional machine learning algorithms. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that the proposed edge-cloud deployment and in-context learning task offloading method can achieve satisfactory generation service quality without dedicated model training or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Whittle's index-based age-of-information minimization in multi-energy harvesting source networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of source sampling and transmission scheduling for age-of-information minimization in a system consisting of multiple energy harvesting (EH) sources and a sink node. At each time, one of the sources is selected by the scheduler and the quality of its channel to the sink is measured. This probed channel quality is then used to decide whether a source will sample an observation and transmit the packet to the sink in that time slot. We formulate this problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) assuming i.i.d. energy arrival and channel fading processes, and relax it using a Lagrange multiplier. We apply a near optimal Whittle's index policy to decide the node to be probed. Next, for the probed node, we derive an optimal threshold policy, which recommends source sampling and observation transmission from the probed source only when the measured channel quality is above a threshold. Our proposed policy is called Whittle's index and threshold based source scheduling and sampling (WITS3) policy. However, in order to calculate Whittle's indices, one must be aware of the underlying processes' transition matrices, which are occasionally concealed from the scheduler. Therefore, we further propose a variant Q-WITS3 of WITS3 based on Q-learning assisted by two timescale asynchronous stochastic approximation, which seeks to learn Whittle's indices and optimal policies for the case with unknown channel states and EH characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms over two baseline policies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data-driven Joint-level Calibration of Cable-driven Surgical Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowing accurate joint positions is crucial for safe and precise control of laparoscopic surgical robots, especially for the automation of surgical sub-tasks. These robots have often been designed with cable-driven arms and tools because cables allow for larger motors to be placed at the base of the robot, further from the operating area where space is at a premium. However, by connecting the joint to its motor with a cable, any stretch in the cable can lead to errors in kinematic estimation from encoders at the motor, which can result in difficulties for accurate control of the surgical tool. In this work, we propose an efficient data-driven calibration of positioning joints of such robots, in this case the RAVEN-II surgical robotics research platform. While the calibration takes only 8-21 minutes, the accuracy of the calibrated joints remains high during a 6-hour heavily loaded operation, suggesting desirable feasibility in real practice. The calibration models take original robot states as input and are trained using zig-zag trajectories within a desired sparsity, requiring no additional sensors after training. Compared to fixed offset compensation, the Deep Neural Network calibration model can further reduce 76 percent of error and achieve accuracy of 0.104 deg, 0.120 deg, and 0.118 mm in joints 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In contrast to end-to-end models, experiments suggest that the DNN model achieves better accuracy and faster convergence when outputting the error to correct original inaccurate joint positions. Furthermore, a linear regression model is shown to have 160 times faster inference speed than DNN models for application within the 1000 Hz servo control loop, with slightly compromised accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The field of robotics is a quickly evolving feat of technology that accepts contributions from various genres of science. Neuroscience, Physiology, Chemistry, Material science, Computer science, and the wide umbrella of mechatronics have all simultaneously contributed to many innovations in the prosthetic applications of robotics. This review begins with a discussion of the scope of the term robotic prosthetics and discusses the evolving domain of Neuroprosthetics. The discussion is then constrained to focus on various actuation and control strategies for robotic prosthetic limbs. This review discusses various soft robotic actuators such as EAP, SMA, FFA, etc., and the merits of such actuators over conventional hard robotic actuators. Options in control strategies for robotic prosthetics, that are in various states of research and development, are reviewed. This paper concludes the discussion with an analysis regarding the prospective direction in which this field of robotic prosthetics is evolving in terms of actuation, control, and other features relevant to artificial limbs. This paper intends to review some of the emerging research and development trends in the field of robotic prosthetics and summarize many tangents that are represented under this broad domain in an approachable manner.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics with Set-Based Confidence: Convergence Criteria and Periodic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new multidimensional extension of the Hegselmann-Krause (HK) opinion dynamics model, where opinion proximity is not determined by a norm or metric. Instead, each agent trusts opinions within the Minkowski sum $\xi+\mathcal{O}$, where $\xi$ is the agent's current opinion and $\mathcal{O}$ is the confidence set defining acceptable deviations. During each iteration, agents update their opinions by simultaneously averaging the trusted opinions. Unlike traditional HK systems, where $\mathcal{O}$ is a ball in some norm, our model allows the confidence set to be non-convex and even unbounded.
  We demonstrate that the new model, referred to as SCOD (Set-based Confidence Opinion Dynamics), can exhibit properties absent in the conventional HK model. Some solutions may converge to non-equilibrium points in the state space, while others oscillate periodically. These ``pathologies'' disappear if the set $\mathcal{O}$ is symmetric and contains zero in its interior: similar to the usual HK model, SCOD then converges in a finite number of iterations to one of the equilibrium points. The latter property is also preserved if one agent is "stubborn" and resists changing their opinion, yet still influences the others; however, two stubborn agents can lead to oscillations.</description>

      <title>Configuring Safe Spiking Neural Controllers for Cyber-Physical Systems through Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a subclass of neuromorphic models that have great potential to be used as controllers in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) due to their energy efficiency. They can benefit from the prevalent approach of first training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and then translating to an SNN with subsequent hyperparameter tuning. The tuning is required to ensure that the resulting SNN is accurate with respect to the ANN in terms of metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, SNN controllers for safety-critical CPSs must also satisfy safety specifications, which are not guaranteed by the conversion approach. In this paper, we propose a solution which tunes the $temporal$ $window$ hyperparameter of the translated SNN to ensure both accuracy and compliance with the safe range specification that requires the SNN outputs to remain within a safe range. The core verification problem is modelled using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and is solved with Gurobi. When the controller fails to meet the range specification, we compute tight bounds on the SNN outputs as feedback for the CPS developer. To mitigate the high computational cost of verification, we integrate data-driven steps to minimize verification calls. Our approach provides designers with the confidence to safely integrate energy-efficient SNN controllers into modern CPSs. We demonstrate our approach with experimental results on five different benchmark neural controllers.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for GEO-LEO Coexisting Satellite Systems: A Traffic-Aware Throughput Maximization Precoder Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency coexistence between geostationary orbit (GEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems is expected to be a promising approach for relieving spectrum scarcity. However, it is essential to manage mutual interference between GEO and LEO satellite systems for frequency coexistence. Specifically, \emph{in-line interference}, caused by LEO satellites moving near the line-of-sight path between GEO satellite and GEO users (GUs), can significantly degrade GEO system throughput. This paper put forth a novel rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with a super-common message for GEO-LEO coexisting satellite systems (CSS). By employing a super-common message that GUs can decode, GUs can mitigate the in-line interference by successive interference cancellation (SIC). Moreover, we formulate a traffic-aware throughput maximization (TTM) problem to satisfy the heterogeneous traffic demands of users by minimizing total unmet throughput demands (or user dissatisfaction). By doing so, the TTM precoder can be flexibly adjusted according to the interference leakage from LEO satellites to GUs and target traffic demands. Numerical results confirm that our proposed method ensures seamless connectivity even in the GEO-LEO in-line interference regime under imperfect channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and receiver.</description>

      <title>Scenario-based Thermal Management Parametrization Through Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal system of battery electric vehicles demands advanced control. Its thermal management needs to effectively control active components across varying operating conditions. While robust control function parametrization is required, current methodologies show significant drawbacks. They consume considerable time, human effort, and extensive real-world testing. Consequently, there is a need for innovative and intelligent solutions that are capable of autonomously parametrizing embedded controllers. Addressing this issue, our paper introduces a learning-based tuning approach. We propose a methodology that benefits from automated scenario generation for increased robustness across vehicle usage scenarios. Our deep reinforcement learning agent processes the tuning task context and incorporates an image-based interpretation of embedded parameter sets. We demonstrate its applicability to a valve controller parametrization task and verify it in real-world vehicle testing. The results highlight the competitive performance to baseline methods. This novel approach contributes to the shift towards virtual development of thermal management functions, with promising potential of large-scale parameter tuning in the automotive industry.</description>

      <title>Discrete Shortest Paths in Optimal Power Flow Feasible Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal power flow (OPF) is a critical optimization problem for power systems to operate at points where cost or operational objectives are optimized. Due to the non-convexity of the set of feasible OPF operating points, it is non-trivial to transition the power system from its current operating point to the optimal one without violating constraints. On top of that, practical considerations dictate that the transition should be achieved using a small number of small-magnitude control actions. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an algorithm for computing a transition path by framing it as a shortest path problem. This problem is formulated in terms of a discretized piece-wise linear path, where the number of pieces is fixed a priori in order to limit the number of control actions. This formulation yields a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with a block tridiagonal structure, which we leverage by utilizing a specialized interior point method. An initial feasible path for our method is generated by solving a sequence of relaxations which are then tightened in a homotopy-like procedure. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Recent research has seen notable progress in the development of linkage-based artificial hands. While previous designs have focused on adaptive grasping, dexterity and biomimetic artificial skin, only a few systems have proposed a lightweight, accessible solution integrating tactile sensing with a compliant linkage-based mechanism. This paper introduces OPENGRASP LITE, an open-source, highly integrated, tactile, and lightweight artificial hand. Leveraging compliant linkage systems and MEMS barometer-based tactile sensing, it offers versatile grasping capabilities with six degrees of actuation. By providing tactile sensors and enabling soft grasping, it serves as an accessible platform for further research in tactile artificial hands.</description>

Abstract: Innovative solutions and developments are being inspected to tackle rising electrical power demand to be supplied by clean forms of energy. The integration of renewable energy generations, varying nature loads, importance of active role of distribution system and consumer participation in grid operation has changed the landscape of classical power grids. Implementation of smarter applications to plan, monitor, operate the grid safely are deemed paramount for efficient, secure and reliable functioning of grid. Although sophisticated computations to process gigantic volume of data to produce useful information in a time critical manner is the paradigm of future grid operations, it brings along the burden of computational complexity. Advancements in quantum technologies holds promising solution for dealing with demanding computational complexity of power system related applications. In this article, we lay out clear motivations for seeking quantum solutions for solving computational burden challenges associated with power system applications. Next we present an overview of quantum solutions for various power system related applications available in current literature and suggest future topics for research. We further highlight challenges with existing quantum solutions for exploiting full quantum capabilities. Additionally, this paper serves as a bridge for power engineers to the quantum world by outlining essential quantum computation fundamentals for enabling smoother transition to future of power system computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers have previously proposed augmenting Signal Temporal Logic (STL) with the value freezing operator in order to express engineering properties that cannot be expressed in STL. This augmented logic is known as STL*. The previous algorithms for STL* monitoring were intractable, and did not scale formulae with nested freeze variables. We present offline discrete-time monitoring algorithms with an acceleration heuristic, both for Boolean monitoring as well as for quantitative robustness monitoring. The acceleration heuristic operates over time intervals where subformulae hold true, rather than over the original trace sample-points. We present experimental validation of our algorithms, the results show that our algorithms can monitor over long traces for formulae with two or three nested freeze variables.
  Our work is the first work with monitoring algorithm implementations for STL* formulae with nested freeze variables.</description>

      <title>Context-aware Mamba-based Reinforcement Learning for social robot navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social robot navigation (SRN) is a relevant problem that involves navigating a pedestrian-rich environment in a socially acceptable manner. It is an essential part of making social robots effective in pedestrian-rich settings. The use cases of such robots could vary from companion robots to warehouse robots to autonomous wheelchairs. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning has been increasingly used in research on social robot navigation. Our work introduces CAMRL (Context-Aware Mamba-based Reinforcement Learning). Mamba is a new deep learning-based State Space Model (SSM) that has achieved results comparable to transformers in sequencing tasks. CAMRL uses Mamba to determine the robot's next action, which maximizes the value of the next state predicted by the neural network, enabling the robot to navigate effectively based on the rewards assigned. We evaluate CAMRL alongside existing solutions (CADRL, LSTM-RL, SARL) using a rigorous testing dataset which involves a variety of densities and environment behaviors based on ORCA and SFM, thus, demonstrating that CAMRL achieves higher success rates, minimizes collisions, and maintains safer distances from pedestrians. This work introduces a new SRN planner, showcasing the potential for deep-state space models for robot navigation.</description>

      <title>Integrating Model-Based Footstep Planning with Model-Free Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Legged Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a control framework that combines model-based footstep planning with Reinforcement Learning (RL), leveraging desired footstep patterns derived from the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) dynamics. Utilizing the LIP model, our method forward predicts robot states and determines the desired foot placement given the velocity commands. We then train an RL policy to track the foot placements without following the full reference motions derived from the LIP model. This partial guidance from the physics model allows the RL policy to integrate the predictive capabilities of the physics-informed dynamics and the adaptability characteristics of the RL controller without overfitting the policy to the template model. Our approach is validated on the MIT Humanoid, demonstrating that our policy can achieve stable yet dynamic locomotion for walking and turning. We further validate the adaptability and generalizability of our policy by extending the locomotion task to unseen, uneven terrain. During the hardware deployment, we have achieved forward walking speeds of up to 1.5 m/s on a treadmill and have successfully performed dynamic locomotion maneuvers such as 90-degree and 180-degree turns.</description>

      <title>Efficient Demand Response Location Targeting for Price Spike Mitigation by Exploiting Price-demand Relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demand response (DR) leverages demand-side flexibility, offering a promising approach to enhance market conditions like mitigating wholesale price spikes. However, poorly chosen DR locations can inadvertently increase electricity prices. For that, we introduce a method to rigorously select DR locations and corresponding demand reductions. We formulate a bilevel program where the upper level determines the DR locations and demand reductions while ensuring the average nodal prices meet a predetermined target. The lower level tackles an economic dispatch (ED) problem and feeds the resulting nodal prices back to the upper level based on post-DR demands. This bilevel formulation presents challenges due to the lower-level non-convexity affecting the upper-level constraints on average nodal prices. To address this, we propose to replace the lower level with a piecewise linear function representing the price-demand relationship, solving iteratively for each linear segment. This results in a tractable mixed-integer linear program. An acceleration strategy is proposed to further reduce the computation time. Numerical studies demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to reduce prices to a desired level. Besides, we empirically show that the proposed approach is robust against inaccurate system parameters and can reduce computation time by over 50%.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Policy and Lyapunov-Certificate Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents novel methods for synthesizing distributionally robust stabilizing neural controllers and certificates for control systems under model uncertainty. A key challenge in designing controllers with stability guarantees for uncertain systems is the accurate determination of and adaptation to shifts in model parametric uncertainty during online deployment. We tackle this with a novel distributionally robust formulation of the Lyapunov derivative chance constraint ensuring a monotonic decrease of the Lyapunov certificate. To avoid the computational complexity involved in dealing with the space of probability measures, we identify a sufficient condition in the form of deterministic convex constraints that ensures the Lyapunov derivative constraint is satisfied. We integrate this condition into a loss function for training a neural network-based controller and show that, for the resulting closed-loop system, the global asymptotic stability of its equilibrium can be certified with high confidence, even with Out-of-Distribution (OoD) model uncertainties. To demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed methodology, we compare it with an uncertainty-agnostic baseline approach and several reinforcement learning approaches in two control problems in simulation.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Safe Probabilistic Invariance Verification of Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring safety through set invariance has proven to be a valuable method in various robotics and control applications. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for the safe probabilistic invariance verification of both discrete- and continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems over an infinite time horizon. The objective is to ascertain the lower and upper bounds of liveness probabilities for a given safe set and set of initial states. The liveness probability signifies the likelihood of the system remaining within the safe set indefinitely, starting from a state in the initial set. To address this problem, we propose optimizations for verifying safe probabilistic invariance in discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems. These optimizations are constructed via either using the Doob's nonnegative supermartingale inequality-based method or relaxing the equations described in [30,32], which can precisely characterize the probability of reaching a target set while avoiding unsafe states. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these optimizations through several examples using semi-definite programming tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes a general dynamic formulation of slack bus. With this aim, the angle constraint imposed by the slack bus is redefined as a set of differential equations and an energy source. The existence and role of the transient component of this source is also discussed in the letter. Based on this framework, the letter shows that the swing equations of synchronous machines can be interpreted as distributed, dynamic, multi-variable, local slack buses. Other relevant cases, including primary and secondary frequency regulation, passive loads as well as grid following and grid forming converters are discussed.</description>

      <title>OCC-MP: A Max-Pressure framework to prioritize transit and high occupancy vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Max-pressure (MP) is a decentralized adaptive traffic signal control approach that has been shown to maximize throughput for private vehicles. However, MP-based signal control algorithms do not differentiate the movement of transit vehicles from private vehicles or between high and single-occupancy private vehicles. Prioritizing the movement of transit or other high occupancy vehicles (HOVs) is vital to reduce congestion and improve the reliability and efficiency of transit operations. This study proposes OCC-MP: a novel MP-based algorithm that considers both vehicle queues and passenger occupancies in computing the weights of movements. By weighing movements with higher passenger occupancies more heavily, transit and other HOVs are implicitly provided with priority, while accounting for any negative impacts of that priority on single occupancy vehicles. And, unlike rule-based transit signal priority (TSP) strategies, OCC-MP more naturally also accommodates conflicting transit routes at a signalized intersection and facilitates their movement, even in mixed traffic without dedicated lanes. Simulations on a grid network under varying demands and transit configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of OCC-MP at providing TSP while simultaneously reducing the negative impact imparted onto lower occupancy private vehicles. Furthermore, OCC-MP is shown to have a larger stable region for demand compared to rule-based TSP strategies integrated into the MP framework. The performance of OCC-MP is also shown to be robust to errors in passenger occupancy information from transit vehicles and can be applied when passenger occupancies of private vehicles are not available. Finally, OCC-MP can be applied in a partially connected vehicle (CV) environment when a subset of vehicles is able to provide information to the signal controller, outperforming baseline methods at low CV penetration rates.</description>

      <title>A Holistic Optimization Framework for Energy Efficient UAV-assisted Fog Computing: Attitude Control, Trajectory Planning and Task Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have significantly enhanced fog computing by acting as both flexible computation platforms and communication mobile relays. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Distributed Adaptive Time-Varying Optimization with Global Asymptotic Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study distributed time-varying optimization for a multi-agent system. We first focus on a class of time-varying quadratic cost functions, and develop a new distributed algorithm that integrates an average estimator and an adaptive optimizer, with both bridged by a Dead Zone Algorithm. Based on a composite Lyapunov function and finite escape-time analysis, we prove the closed-loop global asymptotic convergence to the optimal solution under mild assumptions. Particularly, the introduction of the estimator relaxes the requirement for the Hessians of cost functions, and the integrated design eliminates the waiting time required in the relevant literature for estimating global parameter during algorithm implementation. We then extend this result to a more general class of time-varying cost functions. Two examples are used to verify the proposed designs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Predictive Control of a Conductance-Based Neuron Model via Data-Driven Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective. Precise control of neural systems is essential to experimental investigations of how the brain controls behavior and holds the potential for therapeutic manipulations to correct aberrant network states. Model predictive control, which employs a dynamical model of the system to find optimal control inputs, has promise for dealing with the nonlinear dynamics, high levels of exogenous noise, and limited information about unmeasured states and parameters that are common in a wide range of neural systems. However, the challenge still remains of selecting the right model, constraining its parameters, and synchronizing to the neural system. Approach. As a proof of principle, we used recent advances in data-driven forecasting to construct a nonlinear machine-learning model of a Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron when only the membrane voltage is observable and there are an unknown number of intrinsic currents. Main Results. We show that this approach is able to learn the dynamics of different neuron types and can be used with MPC to force the neuron to engage in arbitrary, researcher-defined spiking behaviors. Significance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of nonlinear MPC of a conductance-based model where there is only realistically limited information about unobservable states and parameters.</description>

      <title>The computation of approximate feedback Stackelberg equilibria in multi-player nonlinear constrained dynamic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15745v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving feedback Stackelberg games with nonlinear dynamics and coupled constraints, a common scenario in practice, presents significant challenges. This work introduces an efficient method for computing approximate local feedback Stackelberg equilibria in multi-player general-sum dynamic games, with continuous state and action spaces. Different from existing (approximate) dynamic programming solutions that are primarily designed for unconstrained problems, our approach involves reformulating a feedback Stackelberg dynamic game into a sequence of nested optimization problems, enabling the derivation of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the establishment of a second-order sufficient condition for local feedback Stackelberg equilibria. We propose a Newton-style primal-dual interior point method for solving constrained linear quadratic (LQ) feedback Stackelberg games, offering provable convergence guarantees. Our method is further extended to compute local feedback Stackelberg equilibria for more general nonlinear games by iteratively approximating them using LQ games, ensuring that their KKT conditions are locally aligned with those of the original nonlinear games. We prove the exponential convergence of our algorithm in constrained nonlinear games. In a feedback Stackelberg game with nonlinear dynamics and (nonconvex) coupled costs and constraints, our experimental results reveal the algorithm's ability to handle infeasible initial conditions and achieve exponential convergence towards an approximate local feedback Stackelberg equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review explores the application of intelligent optimization algorithms to Multi-Objective Optimal Power Flow (MOPF) in enhancing modern power systems. It delves into the challenges posed by the integration of renewables, smart grids, and increasing energy demands, focusing on evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, and deep reinforcement learning. The effectiveness, scalability, and application of these algorithms are analyzed, with findings suggesting that algorithm selection is contingent on the specific MOPF problem at hand, and hybrid approaches offer significant promise. The importance of standard test systems for verifying solutions and the role of software tools in facilitating analysis are emphasized. Future research is directed towards exploiting machine learning for dynamic optimization, embracing decentralized energy systems, and adapting to evolving policy frameworks to improve power system efficiency and sustainability. This review aims to advance MOPF research by highlighting state-of-the-art methodologies and encouraging the development of innovative solutions for future energy challenges.</description>

      <title>Managing O-RAN Networks: xApp Development from Zero to Hero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance proposes an open architecture that disaggregates the RAN and supports executing custom control logic in near-real time from third-party applications, the xApps. Despite O-RAN's efforts, the creation of xApps remains a complex and time-consuming endeavor, aggravated by the sometimes fragmented, outdated, or deprecated documentation from the O-RAN Software Community (OSC). These challenges hinder academia and industry from developing and validating solutions and algorithms on O-RAN networks. This tutorial addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive guide for developing xApps to manage the O-RAN ecosystem from theory to practice. We provide a thorough theoretical foundation of the O-RAN architecture and detail the functionality offered by Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) components. We examine the xApp design and configuration. We explore the xApp lifecycle and demonstrate how to deploy and manage xApps on a Near-RT RIC. We address the xApps' interfaces and capabilities, accompanied by practical examples. We provide comprehensive details on how xApps can control the RAN. We discuss debugging strategies and good practices to aid the xApp developers in testing their xApps. Finally, we review the current landscape and open challenges for creating xApps.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every user authentication scheme involves three login credentials, i.e. a username, a password and a hash value, but only one of them is associated with a user identity. However, this single identity is not robust enough to protect the whole system and the login entries (i.e., the username and password forms) have not been effectively authenticated. Therefore, a multi-factor authentication service is utilized to help guarantee the account security by transmitting a second factor to the user to use. If more identities can be employed for the two login forms to associate with all login credentials, and if the corresponding identifiers are not transmitted via the network and operated by users, such a system can be more robust even without relying on a third-party service. To this end, a triple-identity authentication scheme is designed within a dual-password login-authentication system, which defines identities for the username and the login password, respectively. Therefore, in addition to the traditional server verification, the system can verify the identifiers at the username and password forms in succession. In the triple-identity authentication, the identifiers are entirely managed by the system without involvement of users or any third-party service, and they are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible and independent of personal information. Thus, they are useless in online attacks.</description>

      <title>Vertiport Terminal Scheduling and Throughput Analysis for Multiple Surface Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles have gained immense popularity in the delivery drone market and are now being developed for passenger transportation in urban areas to efficiently enable Urban Air Mobility (UAM). UAM aims to utilize the urban airspace \hidetxt{vertical dimension} to address the problem of heavy road congestion in dense urban cities. VTOL vehicles require vertiport terminals for landing, take-off, passengers boarding or deboarding, refuelling (or charging), and maintenance. An efficient scheduling algorithm is essential to maximize the throughput of the vertiport terminal (vertiminal)\hidetxt{ as well as efficient use of airspace} while maintaining safety protocols to handle the UAM traffic. While traditional departure and taxiing operations can be applied in the context of vertiminal, specific algorithms are required for take-off and landing schedules. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft that require a runway to take-off and climb in a single direction, VTOL vehicles can approach and climb in several directions. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to schedule flights for taxiing, climbing (or approaching) using multiple directions after take-off (before landing) and turnaround on gates. We also derived equations to thoroughly analyze the throughput capacity of a vertiminal considering all its core elements. We have shown that our MILP can achieve the maximum throughput obtained through the equations. Given the input parameters, our analysis can be used to analyze the capacity of a vertiminal without running any simulation, while our MILP can be used to get the most efficient schedule.</description>
