      <title>Energy Growth in $V_LV_L\to V_LV_L,\ V_LV_Lh$ Scattering to Probe Higgs Cubic and HEFT Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the energy scales of perturbative unitarity violation in $V_L V_L \to V_L V_L h$ processes and compare them to $V_L V_L \to hhh$ process. Using these energy scales, we determine which process is more sensitive to potential modifications in the Higgs sector at high-energy colliders. Within the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT), we consider the Higgs cubic coupling and other interactions with and without derivatives. Any HEFT interactions predict the perturbative unitarity violation at a finite scale, and in a generic case, the minimalistic process is $2\to 3$ scattering. Our analysis reveals that the energy scales for unitarity violation in $V_L V_L \to V_L V_L h$ and $V_L V_L \to hhh$ processes are similar across all scenarios considered. If the backgrounds are similar, $V_L V_L h$ final states are more feasible because $V_L V_L h$ has higher branching ratios in cleaner decay modes than $hhh$. We also investigate HEFT derivative interactions derived from various UV models. In these cases, both $V_L V_L \to V_L V_L$ and $V_L V_L \to hh$ processes exhibit unitarity violating behavior. We demonstrate that the energy scales for unitarity violation in $V_L V_L$ final states are comparable to or even lower than those in the $hh$ final state.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter induces time-dependent perturbations in the spacetime metric, enabling its gravitational direct detection. In this work, we propose using astrometry to detect dark matter. After reviewing the calculation of the metric in the presence of scalar dark matter, we study the influence of the perturbations on the apparent motion of astrophysical bodies. We apply our results to angular position measurements of quasars, whose vast distances from Earth present an opportunity to discover dark matter with a mass as low as $10^{-33} \, \mathrm{eV} $. We explore the prospects of very long baseline interferometry and optical astrometric survey measurements for detecting ultralight relics, finding that for the smallest masses, current astrometric surveys can detect dark matter moving locally with a velocity of $10^{-3}$ with energy density as low as $ 3 \times 10 ^{ - 11} ~{\rm GeV} / {\rm cm} ^3 $.</description>

      <title>Precise interpretations of traditional fine-tuning measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover two precise interpretations of traditional electroweak fine-tuning (FT) measures that were historically missed. (i) a statistical interpretation: the traditional FT measure shows the change in plausibility of a model in which a parameter was exchanged for the $Z$ boson mass relative to an untuned model in light of the $Z$ boson mass measurement. (ii) an information-theoretic interpretation: the traditional FT measure shows the exponential of the extra information, measured in nats, relative to an untuned model that you must supply about a parameter in order to fit the $Z$ mass. We derive the mathematical results underlying these interpretations, and explain them using examples from weak scale supersymmetry. These new interpretations shed fresh light on historical and recent studies using traditional FT measures.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Computing Timelike Hadronic Vacuum Polarization and Light-by-Light Scattering: Schwinger Model Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and light-by-light scattering (HLBL) are crucial for evaluating the Standard Model predictions concerning the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. However, direct first-principle lattice gauge theory-based calculations of these observables in the timelike region remain challenging. Discrepancies persist between lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations in the spacelike region and dispersive approaches relying on experimental data parametrization from the timelike region. Here, we introduce a methodology employing 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED), i.e. the Schwinger Model, to investigate the HVP and HLBL. To that end, we use both tensor network techniques, specifically matrix product states, and classical emulators of digital quantum computers. Demonstrating feasibility in a simplified model, our approach sets the stage for future endeavors leveraging digital quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision astrometry offers a way to probe new physics. By measuring the angular position of light sources at unprecedented precision, astrometry could probe minuscule fluctuations of underlying spacetime. This work explores the possibility of probing ultralight dark matter candidates using precision astrometry. Through the coherent and stochastic density fluctuations over the scale of its wavelength, ultralight dark matter perturbs the propagation of light and the geodesics of the observer and source, leading to unique time-dependent signatures in the angular position of background light sources. With detector specifications similar to the current and future astrometry observations, such as Gaia and Roman Space Telescope, it is shown that the ultralight scalar dark matter of mass $10^{-18}\,{\rm eV} \, \textrm{--} \, 10^{-16} \,{\rm eV}$ could be probed when its density near the solar system is about a few thousand times larger than the nominal dark matter density measured on a much larger kpc-scale. This sensitivity is comparable to current pulsar timing array observations at a similar mass range. Explicit expressions for the angular deflection induced by most generic metric perturbations are derived and its gauge invariance is explicitly checked at the linear order.</description>

      <title>Recursion for Wilson-line Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix elements of Wilson-line dressed operators play a central role in the factorization of soft and collinear modes in gauge theories. When expressed using spinor helicity variables, these so-called form factors admit a classification starting from a Maximally Helicity Violating configuration, in close analogy with gauge theory amplitudes. We show that a single-line complex momentum shift can be used to derive recursion relations that efficiently compute these helicity form factors at tree-level: a combination of lower point form factors and on-shell amplitudes serve as the input building blocks. We obtain novel compact expressions for the $1\to 2$ and $1\to 3$ splitting functions in QCD, which also serves to validate our methods.</description>

      <title>Prospects for New Discoveries Through Precision Measurements at $e^+e^-$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a complete next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation of $e^+e^-\rightarrow ZH$ in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, including all contributions from dimension-6 operators. At NLO, there are novel dependencies on CP violating parameters in the gauge sector, on modifications to the Higgs boson self-couplings, on alterations to the top quark Yukawa couplings, and on 4-fermion operators involving the electron and the top quark, among others. We show that including only the logarithms resulting from renormalization group scaling can produce misleading results, and further, we explicitly demonstrate the constraining power of combining measurements from different energy scales.</description>

      <title>Charm total cross sections with nonuniversal fragmentation treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total charm-pair cross sections in $pp$ collisions are interesting because they can be calculated to NNLO in QCD without any reference to fragmentation effects. On the other hand, the fiducial differential charm cross sections from which the total cross sections must be extrapolated are currently known to NLO+NLL at most (e.g. FONLL), and must be treated for known effects of nonuniversal charm fragmentation. A new procedure using the FONLL framework as input for an empirical parametrization of the data in both shape and normalization, with all its parameters actually fitted to data, is used to derive so-called data-driven FONLL (ddFONLL) parametrizations which can be used to extrapolate the differential cross sections to total cross sections with minimal bias. This includes an empirical treatment of all known non-universal charm fragmentation effects, in particular for the baryon-to-meson ratio as a function of transverse momentum. The total charm-pair cross sections obtained in this way, which supersede all previous ones obtained using the assumption of charm-fragmentation universality, are consistent with NNLO predictions, and allow first studies of their sensitivity e.g. to the charm-quark mass and/or the NNLO gluon PDF at very low transverse momentum fractions $x$.</description>

      <title>Estimate for the neutrino magnetic moment from pulsar kick velocities induced at the birth of strange quark matter neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the magnetic moment of electron neutrinos by computing the neutrino chirality flip rate that can occur in the core of a strange quark matter neutron star at birth. We show that this process allows neutrinos to anisotropically escape thus inducing the star kick velocity. The process is not subject to the no-go theorem since, although the flip from left- to right-handed neutrinos happens at equilibrium, the reverse process does not take place, given that right-handed neutrinos do not interact with matter and therefore detailed balance is lost. For simplicity, we model the star core as consisting of strange quark matter. We find that even when the energy released in right-handed neutrinos is a small fraction of the total energy released in left-handed neutrinos, the process describes kick velocities for natal conditions which are consistent with the observed ones and span the correct range of radii, temperatures and chemical potentials for typical magnetic field intensities. The neutrino magnetic moment is estimated to be $\mu_\nu \sim 3.6 \times 10^{-18}\mu_B$, where $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. This value is more stringent than the bound found for massive neutrinos in a minimal extension of the standard model.</description>

      <title>Flavor-independent yield of high-$p_T$ hadrons from nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data on high-$p_T$ hadron production in heavy ion collisions at Feynman $x_F=0$ indicate at universality of the observed nuclear suppression. Our analysis of the production mechanisms demonstrates important role of the color transparency effects which make the survival probability of a quark-antiquark dipole independent of the quark flavor, provided that the hadron wave function is formed outside the medium. The latter condition imposes restrictions on the range of $p_T$, which should be sufficiently high to make the nuclear suppression universal. We also found that the in-medium broadening rate $\hat q$ (frequently called transport coefficient) significantly depends on the quark flavor, diminishing for heavy quarks.</description>

Abstract: We study the global polarization of spin-$3/2$ hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions. We show in particular that the global tensor polarizations of rank two or three for spin-$3/2$ hadrons are sensitive to the local two or three quark spin correlations respectively in the quark gluon plasma produced in the collision processes. We present the relationships between these measurable tensor polarizations and quark spin correlations in the quark matter system.</description>

      <title>Evolution of current-carrying string networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic string networks are expected to form in early Universe phase transitions via the Kibble mechanism and are unavoidable in several Beyond the Standard Model theories. While most predictions of observational signals of string networks assume featureless Abelian-Higgs or Nambu-Goto string networks, in many such extensions the networks can carry additional degrees of freedom, including charges and currents; these are often generically known as superconducting strings. All such degrees of freedom can impact the evolution of the networks and therefore their observational signatures. We report on the results of $2048^3$ field theory simulations of the evolution of a current-carrying network of strings, highlighting the different scaling behaviours of the network in the radiation and matter eras. We also report the first numerical measurements of the coherence length scales for the charge and current and of the condensate equation of state, and show that the latter mainly depends on the expansion rate, with chirality occurring for the matter era. Qualitatively, the fact that the matter era is the optimal expansion rate for these networks to reach scaling is in agreement with recent analytic modeling.</description>

      <title>Scaling solutions for current-carrying cosmic string networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic string networks are the best motivated relics of cosmological phase transitions, being unavoidable in many physically plausible extensions of the Standard Model. Most studies, including those providing constraints from and forecasts of their observational signals, rely on assumptions of featureless networks, neglecting the additional degrees of freedom on the string worldsheet, e.g. charges and currents, which are all but unavoidable in physically realistic models. An extension of the canonical velocity-dependent one-scale model, accounting for all such possible degrees of freedom, has been recently developed. Here we improve its physical interpretation by studying and classifying its possible asymptotic scaling solutions, and in particular how they are affected by the expansion of the Universe and the available energy loss or transfer mechanisms. We find three classes of solutions. For sufficiently fast expansion rates the charges and currents decay and one asymptotes to the Nambu-Goto case, while for slower expansion rates they can dominate the network dynamics. In between the two there is a third regime in which the network, including its charge and current, reaches full scaling. Under specific but plausible assumptions, this intermediate regime corresponds to the matter-dominated era. Our results agree with, and significantly extend, those of previous studies.</description>

      <title>The asymmetric intrinsic charm in the nucleon and its implications for the $D^{0}$ production in the LHCb $p\!+\!\!^{20}\!N\!e$ fixed-target experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results indicate that charm quarks are intrinsic components of the proton wave function, and that the charm and anticharm distributions for a given value of the Bjorken - $x$ variable can be different. In this paper, we will investigate the impact of this asymmetric intrinsic charm on the production of $D^0$ and ${\bar D}^0$ mesons for fixed target $p \!+ ^{20}\!\!Ne$ collisions at the LHCb. In our calculations, we include the contribution of the gluon-gluon fusion, gluon - charm and recombination processes and assume distinct models for the treatment of the intrinsic charm component. We demonstrate that the presence of an intrinsic charm improves the description of the current data for the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of $D$ mesons. However, such models are not able to describe the LHCb data for the $D^0$-${\bar D}^0$ asymmetry at large transverse momentum, which point out that the description of the intrinsic charm needs to be improved and/or new effects should be taken into account in the production of heavy mesons at forward rapidities in fixed - target collisions.</description>

      <title>$\cal{CP}$-sensitive simplified template cross-sections for $t\bar t H$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\cal{CP}$ structure of the Higgs boson is a fundamental property which has not yet been constrained with high precision. $\cal{CP}$ violation in the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and top quark pair can be probed directly at the Large Hadron Collider by measuring top-quark-associated Higgs production. Multivariate analysis techniques commonly developed so far by the experiments are designed for a specific signal model and, therefore, complicate reinterpretations and statistical combinations. With this motivation in mind, we propose a $\cal{CP}$-sensitive extension of the simplified template cross-section (STXS) framework. Considering multiple Higgs decay channels, we perform an in-depth comparison of $\cal{CP}$-sensitive observables and combinations thereof. Our resulting proposal is to extend the existing binning in the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson $p_{T,H}$ by either the pseudorapidity difference of the two top-quarks $\Delta \eta_{t\bar t}$, or a variable that is based on the top quark momenta, namely $b_2$ or the Collins-Soper angle $|\cos\theta^*|$. We demonstrate that this variable selection provides close to optimal sensitivity to the $\cal{CP}$ mixture in the top Yukawa coupling for an integrated luminosity of $300\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, by comparing it to the results of a multivariate analysis. Our results also suggest a benefit of the two-dimensional STXS extension at 3000$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: The nearly aligned Higgs Effective Field Theory (naHEFT) is based on the general assumption: all deviations in the Higgs boson couplings are originated from quantum one-loop effects of new particles that are integrated out. If the new particles integrated out have the same non-decoupling property, physics of the electroweak symmetry breaking can be then described by several parameters in the naHEFT, so that there is a correlation among the Higgs boson couplings such as $h \gamma \gamma$, $hWW$ and $hhh$ couplings. In this paper, we analyze the strongly first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) with the condition of sphaleron decoupling and the completion condition of the phase transition, and investigate the relation among the deviations in the Higgs boson couplings and the dynamics of the EWPTs. We also take into account the gravitational wave spectrum as well as the primordial black hole predicted at the EWPT. We show that if the new particles integrated out include charged scalar states future precision measurements of the $h \gamma \gamma$ coupling can give a useful prediction on the $hhh$ coupling to realize the strongly first-order EWPT. We can explore the nature of EWPT and the new physics behind it by the combination of precision measurements of various Higgs boson couplings at future collider experiments, gravitational wave observations at future space-based interferometers and searches for primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Precise measurement of light-quark electroweak couplings at future colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroweak Precision Measurements are stringent tests of the Standard Model and sensitive probes to New Physics. Accurate studies of the Z-boson couplings to the first-generation quarks could reveal potential discrepancies between the fundamental theory and experimental data. Future lepton colliders offering high statistics of Z bosons would be an excellent tool to perform such a measurement based on comparison of radiative and non-radiative hadronic decays of the Z boson. Due to the difference in quark charge, the relative contribution of the events with final-state radiation (FSR) directly reflects the ratio of up- and down-type quark decays. Such an analysis requires a proper distinction between photons coming from different sources, including initial-state radiation (ISR), FSR, parton showers and hadronisation. In our talk, we will show how to extract the values of the Z couplings to quarks and present preliminary results of the analysis for ILC.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of (multi-)strange hadrons in oxygen-oxygen collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~7$ TeV using EPOS4 and AMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LHC is anticipated to collect data from oxygen-oxygen ($O+O$) collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~7$ TeV to further investigate the particle production mechanisms. In the present work, we report on the predictions of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$-spectra), $dN/dy$, yield ratios relative to pions, $p_{\rm T}$-differential ratios of (multi-)strange hadrons in $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~7$ TeV using EPOS4 and AMPT models. Both models differ fundamentally, EPOS4 incorporates a QGP phase, while AMPT focuses on pre-formed hadron interactions. We observed that AMPT qualitatively fails to predict strangeness enhancement in $O+O$ collisions, while EPOS4 predicts a significant enhancement. We also observed the hints of stronger radial flow in EPOS4 compared to AMPT in $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~7$ TeV. AMPT incorporates some flow effects, but EPOS4's implementation of full hydrodynamic flow appears to be significantly more effective in reproducing the experimental data. Both models interestingly predict the final state multiplicity overlap with $pp$, $p+Pb$, and $Pb+Pb$ collisions. The upcoming data on $O+O$ collisions at the LHC is expected to play a crucial role both, constraining the model parameters and significantly refining our understanding of these theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Light quark mass dependence of nucleon mass to two-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon self energy through the sixth chiral order in the covariant $SU(2)$ chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) in the single baryon sector. The validity of the extended on-mass-shell (EOMS) renormalization scheme is explicitly verified to two-loop order, manifested by the miraculous cancellation of all nonlocal divergences and power-counting-breaking (PCB) terms that are nonanalytic in pion mass. Using the $\sigma_{\pi N}$ term determined from the latest lattice simulation to constrain some unknown higher-order low energy constants (LECs), we predict the nucleon mass in the chiral limit to be $856.6\pm 1.7$ MeV. It is found that the EOMS scheme exhibits quite satisfactory convergence behavior through ${\cal O}(q^6)$ around physical point. We also predict the pion mass dependence of the nucleon mass to the accuracy of ${\cal O}(q^6)$, which is in satisfactory agreement with the recent lattice results over a wide range of pion mass.</description>

      <title>An improved description of charm fragmentation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fragmentation of heavy quarks into heavy-flavoured hadrons, specifically the production of charmed mesons in $e^+e^-$ collisions, at different centre-of-mass energies. We focus our attention on the ratio of moments of the $D^{*+}$ energy spectrum measured by ALEPH and CLEO. This ratio is believed to provide us with a direct test of perturbative QCD evolution because hadronisation effects should cancel between the numerator and denominator. However, state-of-the-art calculations based on standard (final-state) collinear factorisation fail to describe the experimental data. We show that this discrepancy is considerably reduced if heavy-quark threshold effects are accounted for not only in DGLAP evolution, as it is usually done, but also in the resummed coefficient functions.</description>

      <title>Cogenesis by a sliding pNGB with symmetry non-restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) with an initial misalignment angle can drive successful spontaneous baryogenesis, and become a good dark matter candidate if the corresponding global symmetry is non-restored at high temperatures. Considering a dimension-five explicit breaking operator, we find that the pNGB starts its motion with a sliding across rapidly decreasing potential barriers during which the baryon asymmetry is generated and frozen, and later it oscillates as dark matter. It is predicted that the pNGB mass and decay constant are around $5\,{\rm eV}$ and $3\times10^6\,{\rm GeV}$, respectively, while the radial mode has a light mass $O(10)\,{\rm MeV}$ and a small mixing $O(10^{-4})$ with the Higgs boson. Applied to the Majoron in the type-I seesaw model, the heaviest right-handed neutrino is required to be as light as $100\,{\rm GeV}$. These predictions can be tested at kaon experiments, heavy neutral lepton searches, LHC, and future colliders.</description>

      <title>The evolution of the transverse-momentum dependent gluon distribution at small $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the colour dipole picture for photon-nucleus interactions at small $x$ together with the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective theory, we demonstrate that the next-to-leading (NLO) order corrections to the cross-section for the inclusive production of a pair of hard jets encode not only the JIMWLK evolution with decreasing $x$, but also the DGLAP evolution of the gluon distribution function and the CSS evolution of the gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution. The emergent CSS equation takes the form of a rate equation describing the evolution of the dijet distribution in the transverse momentum imbalance $K_\perp$ when increasing the dijet relative momentum $P_\perp$. All three types of evolution become important when both $P_\perp$ and $K_\perp$ are much larger than the nuclear saturation momentum $Q_s(x)$ and we propose a framework which encompasses all of them. The solution to the JIMWLK equation provides the source term for the DGLAP evolution with increasing $K_\perp$, which in turn generates the initial condition for the CSS evolution with increasing $P_\perp$.</description>

      <title>Parnassus: An Automated Approach to Accurate, Precise, and Fast Detector Simulation and Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detector simulation and reconstruction are a significant computational bottleneck in particle physics. We develop Particle-flow Neural Assisted Simulations (Parnassus) to address this challenge. Our deep learning model takes as input a point cloud (particles impinging on a detector) and produces a point cloud (reconstructed particles). By combining detector simulations and reconstruction into one step, we aim to minimize resource utilization and enable fast surrogate models suitable for application both inside and outside large collaborations. We demonstrate this approach using a publicly available dataset of jets passed through the full simulation and reconstruction pipeline of the CMS experiment. We show that Parnassus accurately mimics the CMS particle flow algorithm on the (statistically) same events it was trained on and can generalize to jet momentum and type outside of the training distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I examined a phenomenological Nijmegen and a first principles HAL QCD $\Xi N$ potentials to study $\alpha\Xi$ ineractions. A Woods-Saxon type form for $\alpha\Xi$ potential in the single-folding potential approach is derived by using the spin- and isospin averaged $\Xi N$ interactions. The possibility of resonance or bound state is searched and accordingly, the low energy scattering phase shift parameters of $\alpha\Xi$ are calculated. The numerical results show that even though two $ \Xi N $ potentials have significantly dissimilar isospin (I) and spin (S) components, $_{\Xi}^{5}H $ could be only a Coulomb-assisted resonance state that appears about $ 0.5 $ MeV below the threshold of $\alpha+\Xi^{-} $ for both model of potentials.</description>

      <title>Does the Sun have a Dark Disk?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun is not quite a perfect sphere, and its oblateness, thought to be induced through its rotation, has been measured using optical observations of its radius. Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury's orbit. The various assessments do not agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury's orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun's metallicity with its neutrino yield.
  The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury's orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future orbital measurements of Mercury and near-Sun asteroids can refine these constraints.</description>

      <title>PREX and CREX: Evidence for Strong Isovector Spin-Orbit Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent PREX-2 and CREX data on the model-independent extraction of the charge-weak form factor difference $\Delta F_{\rm CW}$ in $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca challenge modern nuclear energy density functionals (EDFs) as well as our present understanding on the neutron skin and nuclear symmetry energy. Within the Skyrme-like EDFs, we demonstrate that the isovector spin-orbit interaction can strongly change the $\Delta F_{\rm CW}$ in $^{48}$Ca while it has essentially no influence on the $\Delta F_{\rm CW}$ in $^{208}$Pb, mainly due to the eight spin-orbit unpaired $1f_{7/2}$ neutrons in $^{48}$Ca. To simultaneously describe PREX-2 and CREX data in $1\sigma$ error, we find the strength of isovector spin-orbit interaction should be larger than about four times of that in the conventional Skyrme-like EDFs, implying the neutrons and protons have significantly different spin-orbit interaction. To further reconcile the data on electric dipole polarizability in $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca, we obtain $L \approx 55$ MeV for the slope parameter of the symmetry energy, $\Delta r_{\rm np}(^{208}\rm{Pb}) \approx 0.19$ fm and $\Delta r_{\rm np}(^{48}\rm{Ca}) \approx 0.12$ fm for the neutron skin thickness. The implications of the strong isovector spin-orbit interaction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Calculating Bayesian evidence for inflationary models using CONNECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian evidence is a standard method used for comparing the ability of different models to fit available data and is used extensively in cosmology. However, since the evidence calculation involves performing an integral of the likelihood function over the entire space of model parameters this can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both CPU and time consumption. For example, in the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model and using CMB data from the Planck satellite, the dimensionality of the model space is over 30 (typically 6 cosmological parameters and 28 nuisance parameters). Even the simplest possible model requires $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ calls to an Einstein--Boltzmann solver such as CLASS or CAMB and takes several days.
  Here we present calculations of Bayesian evidence using the CONNECT framework to calculate cosmological observables. We demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to those obtained using Einstein--Boltzmann solvers, but at a minute fraction of the computational cost. As a test case, we then go on to compute Bayesian evidence ratios for a selection of slow-roll inflationary models.
  In the setup presented here, the total computation time is completely dominated by the likelihood function calculation which now becomes the main bottleneck for increasing computation speed.</description>

Abstract: Multi-TeV muon colliders promise an unprecedented potential for exploring the particle-physics energy frontier, and, at the same time, can probe with fantastic accuracy the precise structure of the Standard Model, and in particular of the Higgs boson sector. Here we consider the possibility to measure the loop-suppressed single-, double-, triple-Higgs boson production mediated by the collinear-photon scattering in the channels $\mu^+\mu^-\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma^\ast \gamma^\ast \to \mu^+\mu^- [H,HH,HHH]$. We study total rates and kinematical distributions in the Standard Model, and compare them with the corresponding vector-boson-fusion processes $V^\ast V^\ast\to H,HH,HHH$ at muon collisions center-of-mass energies in the range between 1.5 and 100 TeV. Possible strategies for enhancing the $\gamma\gamma\to H,HH,HHH$ signal over the dominant vector-boson-fusion production are proposed. The sensitivity of total rates to possible anomalies in the Higgs-boson self-couplings is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There may exist extended configurations in the dark matter sector that are analogues of structures in the visible sector. In this work, we explore non-topological solitonic configurations, specifically Q-balls, and study when they may form macroscopic astrophysical structures and what their distinct characteristics might be. We study in some detail theoretical bounds on their sizes and constraints on the underlying parameters, based on criteria for an astrophysical Q-ball's existence, gravitational stability and viability of solutions. Following this path, one is able to obtain novel limits on astrophysical Q-ball sizes and their underlying parameters. We also explore the gravitational lensing features of different astrophysical Q-ball profiles, which are more general than the simple thin-wall limit. It is seen that the magnification characteristics may be very distinct, depending on the actual details of the solution, even for astrophysical Q-balls having the same size and mass. Assuming that such astrophysical Q-balls may form a small component of the dark matter in the universe, we place limits on this fraction from the gravitational microlensing surveys EROS-2, OGLE-IV, HSC-Subaru and the proposed future survey WFIRST. Exploring various astrophysical Q-ball profiles and sizes, it is found that while for most intermediate masses that we consider, the dark matter fraction comprising astrophysical Q-balls is at most sub-percent, for other masses it may be significantly higher.</description>

      <title>Charmonium production in hot magnetized hyperonic matter -- effects of baryonic Dirac sea and PV mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the medium modifications of the masses of pseudoscalar open charm ($D$ and $\bar D$) mesons and the charmonium state ($\psi(3770)$) in hot isospin asymmetric strange hadronic medium in the presence of an external magnetic field within a chiral effective model. The in-medium partial decay widths of $\psi(3770)$ to $D\bar D$ mesons are computed from the in-medium masses of the initial and final state mesons. These are computed using two light quark pair creation models - (I) the $^3P_0$ model and (II) a field theoretical (FT) model of composite hadrons with quark (and antiquark) constituents. The production cross-sections of $\psi(3770)$, arising from scattering of the $D$ and $\bar D$ mesons, are computed from the relativistic Breit-Wigner spectral function expressed in terms of the in-medium masses and the decay widths of the charmonium state. The effects of the magnetic field are considered due to the Dirac sea (DS) of the baryons, the mixing of the pseudoscalar and vector meson (PV mixing) and the Landau level contributions for the charged hadrons. The production cross-sections of $\psi(3770)$ arising due to scattering of $D^+D^-(D^0\bar{D}^0)$ mesons in the hot magnetized strange hadronic matter are observed to have distinct peak positions, when the magnetic field is large, due to the mass difference of the transverse and longitudinal components of $\psi(3770)$, arising from PV mixing. These can have observable consequences on the dilepton spectra and the production of the charm mesons in ultra-relativistic peripheral heavy ion collision experiments, where the produced magnetic field is huge.</description>

To this end, we perform UrQMD simulations in the cascade mode to produce samples of pions from $5\times 10^6$ Bi+Bi collisions for each of the studied energies. The effects of the quantum-statistical correlations are introduced using the correlation afterburner code CRAB. We fit the correlation function using Gaussian, exponential and symmetric L\'evy shapes and show that for all collision energies the latter provides the best fit. We separate the sample into pions coming from primary processes and pions originating from the decay of long-lived resonances, and show that the source size for the latter is significantly larger than for the former. The source size for the secondaries, is similar but in general larger than the size for the whole pion sample. To further characterize the pion source, we also simulate the effects of a non-ideal detector introducing a momentum smearing parameter, representing the minimum pair momentum and thus a maximum source size that can be resolved. The values of the correlation function intercept parameter are therefore modified from the values they attain for the perfect detector case. Using the core-halo picture of the source, we show that the values of the intercept parameter are influenced by the presence of a significant fraction of core pions coming from the decay of long-lived but slow-moving resonances. These findings serve as a benchmark to compare with future Monte Carlo studies that consider an Equation of State and thus allow for a phase transition within the studied energy domain.</description>

      <title>A study of experimental sensitivities to proton parton distributions with xFitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In collider physics, parton distribution functions (PDFs) play a crucial role in computing theoretical cross sections for scattering reactions. This study explores how different experimental data sets influence extracted PDFs in CTEQ-TEA and MSHT NNLO PDF analyses. To gauge the impact of experimental data, including the HERA and ZEUS combined charm and beauty production, LHCb 7 TeV charm and beauty production, CMS 7 TeV W+c production, and CMS 13 TeV inclusive jets, I utilize the $L_2$ sensitivity statistical indicator in the Hessian framework as a visual representation of their respective impacts. This sensitivity quantifies the statistical pulls on individual data sets against the best-fit PDFs, facilitating the identification of tensions among competing data sets. Using the QCD fitting framework xFitter, I extract the necessary values for plotting $L_2$ sensitivities for ten distinct data sets implemented in the program, employing recent PDF sets from the CTEQ-TEA and MSHT groups. The computed $L_2$ sensitivities estimate the potential impact of the examined data sets.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we use optical theorem to calculate the next-to-leading order corrections to the QCD spectral densities directly in the QCD sum rules for the pseudoscalar and scalar $B_c$ mesons. We take the experimental data as guides to perform updated analysis, and obtain the masses and decay constants, especially the decay constants, which are the fundamental input parameters in the high energy physics, therefore the pure leptonic decay widths, which can be confronted to the experimental data in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the photophobic ALP model in high-mass regions under LHC Run-II. Since the ALP is predominantly coupled with electroweak gauge bosons such as $ZZ$, $WW$, and $Z\gamma$, and less with di-photon, the model may be probed via multi-boson final-state processes. We find that on-shell ALP productions with $Z\gamma$ final states currently provide the best sensitivities for $m_{a} &gt; 40~{\rm GeV}$.</description>

Abstract: The measurements of off-shell Higgs boson contributions in massive gauge boson pair production are known to probe its electroweak interactions across different energy scales. Often employed as an estimator of the Higgs boson width in restricted theories of beyond the Standard Model physics, we revisit this measurement and re-advertise its potential to constrain aspects of Higgs boson non-linearity. We show that this so-called off-shell measurement complements related analyses of multi-Higgs final states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental hints and theoretical frameworks indicating the existence of an extended Higgs sector, we explore the feasibility of detecting a 95 GeV light Higgs boson decaying into a diphoton within the minimal dilaton model at the 14 TeV LHC. Initially, we identify the correlations between the production cross section, decay branching ratios, and model parameters, e.g., the scalar mixing angle $\sin\theta_S$. Subsequently, we utilize Monte Carlo simulations to generate the signal of the light Higgs boson via the $pp \to t\bar{t}(s\to \gamma\gamma)$ process, along with the corresponding backgrounds. To effectively separate the signal from the dominant backgrounds $tt\gamma\gamma$, we employ a meticulous cut-based selection process. Ultimately, we find that with an integrated luminosity of $L = 3000 {{~\rm fb}^{-1}}$, the regions of $|\sin\theta_S|&gt;0.2$ can be covered over the $3\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>On electroweak corrections to neutral current Drell-Yan with the POWHEG BOX</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the requirement of a refined and flexible treatment of electroweak corrections to the neutral current Drell-Yan process, we report on recent developments on various input parameter/renormalization schemes for the calculation of fully differential cross sections, including both on-shell and MSbar schemes. The latter are particularly interesting for direct determinations of running couplings at the highest LHC energies. The calculations feature next-to-leading order precision with additional higher order contributions from universal corrections such as $\Delta \alpha$ and $\Delta \rho$. All the discussed input parameter/renormalization scheme options are implemented in the package of POWHEG-BOX-V2 dedicated to the neutral current Drell-Yan simulation, i.e. Z_ew-BMNNPV, which is used to obtain the presented numerical results. In particular, a comprehensive analysis on physical observables calculated with different input parameter/renormalization schemes is presented, addressing the Z peak invariant mass region as well as the high energy window. We take the opportunity of reporting also on additional improvements and options introduced in the package Z_ew-BMNNPV after svn revision 3376, such as different options for the treatment of the hadronic contribution to the running of the electromagnetic coupling and for the handling of the unstable Z resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles emerge in many models for physics beyond the Standard Model. Thus, they have gained increasing research interest in both experimental and theoretical physics apart from their original proposition as a solution to the strong $CP$-problem. Among other aspects it has recently been shown that ALPs can potentially provide a solution to the long-lasting discrepancy between theory and experiment of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Provided that the ALP has flavor-violating couplings to leptons, they can also mediate flavor-violating decays like $\mu\to e\gamma$. Both processes are mediated through related form factors that we compute to two-loop order. We further show numerical implications of our calculations and how they might affect constraints on ALP couplings derived from experiments.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the dip observed near the total energy of 3872 MeV in the recent cross section data from the BESIII Collaboration for $e^+e^-\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^- $ admits a natural explanation as a coupled-channel effect: it is a consequence of unitarity and a strong $S$-wave $D\bar D^*$ attraction that generates the state $X(3872)$. We anticipate the appearance of a similar dip in the $e^+e^-\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ final state near the $D^*\bar{D}^*$ threshold driven by the same general mechanism, then to be interpreted as a signature of the predicted spin-two partner of the $X(3872)$.</description>

      <title>Signature decay modes of the compact doubly-heavy tetraquarks $T_{bb\bar{u} \bar{d}}$ and $T_{bc\bar{u} \bar{d}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the expectations that the lowest-lying doubly-bottom tetraquark $T_{bb\bar u \bar d}$ ($J^P = 1^+$) and the bottom-charm tetraquark $T_{bc\bar u \bar d}$ ($J^P = 0^+$) are stable against strong and electromagnetic decays, we work out a number of semileptonic and non-leptonic weak decays of these hadrons, making use of the heavy quark symmetry. In doing this, we concentrate on the exclusive decays involving also tetraquarks in the final states, i.e., transitions such as $T_{bb\bar u \bar d} \to T_{bc\bar u \bar d}\, (\ell^- \nu_\ell,\, h^-)$ and $T_{bc\bar u \bar d} \to T_{cc\bar u \bar d}\, (\ell^- \nu_\ell,\, h^-)$, where $h^- = \pi^-, \rho^-, a_1^-, D^-_s, D^{*-}_s$. So far, only the $J^P = 1^+$ tetraquark $T_{cc\bar u \bar d}$ has been discovered, which we identify with the $I = 0$ $T_{cc}^+$ object, compatible with $J^P = 1^+$ and having the pole mass relative to the $D^{*+} D^0$ mass threshold and decay widths $\delta m = M (T_{cc}^+) - ( M (D^{*+}) + M (D^0) ) = - 360 \pm 40^{+4}_{-0}$ keV and $\Gamma (T_{cc}^+) = 48^{+2}_{-14}$ keV. Experimental discoveries of the transitions worked out here, and related ones involving doubly-heavy baryons, will quantify the diquark-antidiquark component of these tetraquarks.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of hidden-charm strange pentaquarks, we conduct a systematic study of the magnetic moments of the hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks in molecular picture. We calculate magnetic moments of hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks with strangeness-1 and 2. Magnetic moment gives valuable information about the inner structure and shape of the hadron. The obtained results may be helpful to determine the inner structure of these new yet hypothetical states.</description>

Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of charged hadrons in $p+p$, $p+Pb$ and $Pb+Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt {s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are presented here within the rapidity range of $-2.5&lt;y&lt;2.0$. We study the medium effects, which is produced by heavy ion collisions, on the behaviour of charged hadrons, by using a phenomenological fit function. These effects are attributed to two main factors: the transverse collective flow and the the energy loss of charged hadrons due to multiple scatterings. We observe the transverse collective flow at low and intermediate $p_T$ region and the energy loss at high $p_T$ region. Here we take all the published data from the ATLAS collaboration.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal Couplings and the Forgotten Field of Axion Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.04179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the multifield dynamics of axion models nonminimally coupled to gravity. As usual, we consider a canonical $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking model in which the axion is the phase of a complex scalar field. If the complex scalar field has a nonminimal coupling to gravity, then the (oft-forgotten) radial component can drive a phase of inflation prior to an inflationary phase driven by the axion field. In this setup, the mass of the axion field is dependent on the radial field because of the nonminimal coupling, and the axion remains extremely light during the phase of radial inflation. As the radial field approaches the minimum of its potential, there is a transition to a second phase of inflation during which the axion field contributes a substantial fraction of the system's total energy density, yielding a phase of "natural inflation." This system exhibits ultra-light isocurvature perturbations, which are converted to adiabatic perturbations by a turning field-space trajectory. For models wherein the CMB pivot scale exited the horizon well before the turn, this acts to suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, without generating CMB non-Gaussianity or observable isocurvature perturbations. Finally, we note that for certain parameters the interaction strength between axion and gauge fields can be suppressed during the first phase of inflation relative to its value during the second phase by several orders of magnitude. This decouples the constraints on the inflationary production of gauge fields (e.g., from primordial black holes) from the constraints on their production during (p)reheating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the opportunities of using electron scattering by screened Coulomb potential as a tool to retrieve properties of the relativistic vortex beams of electrons, such as their transverse momentum and orbital angular momentum (OAM). We focus on relativistic and ultra-relativistic regimes of the electron energies of at least several MeV and higher, in which the transverse beam momentum is typically much smaller than its longitudinal momentum. Different scattering scenarios for the incident electron beam are considered. In particular, the scattering by a very wide target can be used to probe the electron transverse momentum when its values are larger than 10 keV. The scattering by a target of a width comparable to that of the incident beam allows one to obtain information about the electron OAM. Varying target sizes in the range from couple to hundreds of nanometers, one can in principle distinguish OAM values from several units of $\hbar$ up to thousands and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the angular distribution of lepton pairs produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions as a probe of thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma. We focus on dileptons with invariant masses large enough that they are produced through quark-antiquark annihilation in the early stages of the collision. The angular distribution of the lepton in the rest frame of the pair then reflects the angular distribution of quark momenta. At early times, the transverse pressure of the quark-gluon plasma is larger than its longitudinal pressure as a result of the fast longitudinal expansion, which results in an oblate lepton distribution. By contrast, direct (Drell-Yan) production by quarks and antiquarks from incoming nuclei, whose momenta are essentially longitudinal, results in a prolate distribution. As the invariant mass increases, Drell-Yan gradually becomes the dominant source of dilepton production, and the lepton distribution evolves from oblate to prolate. The invariant mass at which the transition occurs is highly sensitive to the equilibration time of the quark-gluon plasma or, equivalently, the shear viscosity over entropy ratio $\eta/s$ in the early stages of the collision.</description>

      <title>Central-surface-densities correlation in general MOND theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the foundational axioms of MOND alone predict a strong correlation between a bulk measure of the baryonic surface density, $\Sigma_B$, and the corresponding dynamical one, $\Sigma_D$, of an isolated object, such as a galaxy. The correlation is encapsulated by its high- and low-$\Sigma_B$ behaviors. For $\Sigma_B\gg\Sigma_M\equiv a_0/2\pi G$ ($\Sigma_M$ is the critical MOND surface density) one has $\Sigma_D\approx\Sigma_B$. Their difference -- which would be interpreted as the contribution of dark matter -- is $\Sigma_P=\Sigma_D-\Sigma_B\sim\Sigma_M\ll\Sigma_B$. In the deep-MOND limit, $\Sigma_B\ll\Sigma_M$, one has $\Sigma_D\sim (\Sigma_M\Sigma_B)^{1/2}$. This is a primary prediction of MOND, shared by all theories that embody its basic tenets. Sharper correlations, even strict algebraic relations, $\Sigma_D(\Sigma_B)$, are predicted in specific MOND theories, for specific classes of mass distribution -- e.g., pure discs, or spherical systems -- and for specific definitions of the surface densities. I proceed to discuss such tighter correlations for the central surface densities of axisymmetric galactic systems, $\Sigma^0_B$ and $\Sigma^0_D$. Past work has demonstrated such relations for pure discs in the AQUAL and QUMOND theories. Here I consider them in broader classes of MOND theories. For most observed systems, $\Sigma^0_D$ can not be determined directly at present, but, in many cases, a good proxy for it is the acceleration integral $\mathcal{G}\equiv\int_0^\infty g_r d\ln~r$, where $g_r$ is the radial acceleration along a reflection-symmetry plane of a system, such as a disc galaxy. $\mathcal{G}$ can be determined directly from the rotation curve. I discuss the extent to which $\mathcal{G}$ is a good proxy for $\Sigma^0_D$, and how the relation between them depends on system geometry, from pure discs, through disc-plus-bulge ones, to quasi-spherical systems.</description>

      <title>Inflation and reheating in quadratic metric-affine gravity with derivative couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of metric-affine theories of gravity, where both the metric and connection are treated as independent variables, we consider actions quadratic in the Ricci scalar curvature coupled non-minimally to a scalar field through derivative couplings. Our analysis delves into the inflationary predictions, revealing their consistency with the latest observational constraints across a wide range of parameters. This compatibility permits adjustments such as an increase in the spectral index and a reduction in the tensor-to-scalar ratio. While we do not propose a specific reheating mechanism, our analysis demonstrates that within the quadratic model of inflation, the maximum reheating temperature can reach $\sim 3\times10^{15}\, {\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers and approximate universal relations for fermion soliton stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermion soliton stars are a consistent model of exotic compact objects which involve a nonlinear interaction between a real scalar field and fermions through a Yukawa term. This interaction results in an effective fermion mass that depends upon the vacuum structure in the scalar potential. In this work we investigate the tidal deformations of fermion soliton stars and compute the corresponding tidal Love numbers for different model parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the existence of approximate universal relations for the electric and magnetic tidal deformabilities of these stars, and compare them with other solutions of general relativity, such as neutron stars or boson stars. These relations for fermion soliton stars are less universal than for neutron stars, but they are sufficiently different from the ordinary neutron star case that a measurement of the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers (as potentially achievable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors) can be used to disentangle these families of compact objects. Finally, we discuss the conditions for tidal disruption of fermion soliton stars in a binary system and estimate the detectability of the electromagnetic signal associated with such tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Dual Inflation and Bounce Cosmologies Interpretation of Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a dual scenario of generalized inflation and bounce cosmologies, producing a scale-invariant curvature perturbation spectrum. Bayesian analysis with pulsar timing array data identifies, for the first time, viable regions from inflation and bounce that simultaneously explain stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signals and CMB anisotropies. Bayes factor calculations strongly favor this dual scenario over conventional sources and provide initial evidence of a duality between inflation and bounce regarding SGWB, offering new insights for early universe model-building and future observations.</description>
