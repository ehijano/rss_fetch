      <title>Synthesis of Mg$_2$IrH$_5$: A potential pathway to high-$T_c$ hydride superconductivity at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following long-standing predictions associated with hydrogen, high-temperature superconductivity has recently been observed in several hydride-based materials. Nevertheless, these high-$T_c$ phases only exist at extremely high pressures, and achieving high transition temperatures at ambient pressure remains a major challenge. Recent predictions of the complex hydride Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{6}$ may help overcome this challenge with calculations of high-$T_c$ superconductivity (65 K$~&lt;~T_c~&lt;~$ 170 K) in a material that is stable at atmospheric pressure. In this work, the synthesis of Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{6}$ was targeted over a broad range of $P$-$T$ conditions, and the resulting products were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrational spectroscopy, in concert with first-principles calculations. The results indicate that the charge-balanced complex hydride Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{5}$ is more stable over all conditions tested up to ca 28 GPa. The resulting hydride is isostructural with the predicted superconducting Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{6}$ phase except for a single hydrogen vacancy, which shows a favorable replacement barrier upon insertion of hydrogen into the lattice. Bulk Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{5}$ is readily accessible at mild $P$-$T$ conditions and may thus represent a convenient platform to access superconducting Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{6}$ via non-equilibrium processing methods.</description>

      <title>Theory of Josephson scanning microscopy with $s$-wave tip on unconventional superconducting surface: application to Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy (JSTM) is a powerful probe of the local superconducting order parameter, but studies have been largely limited to cases where superconducting sample and superconducting tip both have the same gap symmetry -- either s-wave or d-wave. It has been generally assumed that in an ideal $s$-to-$d$ JSTM experiment the critical current would vanish everywhere, as expected for ideal $c$-axis planar junctions. We show here that this is not the case. Employing first-principles Wannier functions for Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, we develop a scheme to compute Josephson critical current ($I_{c}$) and quasiparticle tunneling current measured by JSTM with sub-angstrom resolution. We demonstrate that the critical current for tunneling between an s-wave tip and a superconducting cuprate sample has largest magnitude above O sites and it vanishes above Cu sites. $I_{c}$ changes sign under $\pi/2$-rotation and its average over a unit cell vanishes, as a direct consequence of the $d$-wave gap symmetry in cuprates. Further, we show that $I_{c}$ is strongly suppressed in the close vicinity of a Zn-like impurity owing to suppression of the superconducting order parameter. More interestingly, $I_{c}$ acquires non-vanishing values above the Cu sites near the impurity. The critical current modulations produced by the impurity occur at characteristic wavevectors distinct from the quasiparticle interference (QPI) analogue. Furthermore, the quasiparticle tunneling spectra in the JSTM set-up shows coherence peaks and impurity-induced resonances shifted by the $s$-wave tip gap. We discuss similarities and differences in JSTM observables and conventional STM observables, making specific predictions that can be tested in future JSTM experiments.</description>

      <title>Photogalvanic phenomena in superconductors supporting intrinsic diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we suggest a phenomenological theory of photogalvanic phenomena in superconducting materials and structures revealing the diode effect. Starting from a generalized London model including the quadratic nonlinearity in the relation between the supercurrent and superfluid velocity we show that the electromagnetic wave incident on the superconductor can generate a nontrivial superconducting phase difference between the ends of the sample. Being enclosed in a superconducting loop such phase battery should generate a dc supercurrent circulating in the loop. Increasing the electromagnetic wave intensity one can provoke the switching between the loop states with different vorticities.</description>

      <title>A Novel Perspective on Ideal Chern Bands with Strong Short-Range Repulsion: Applications to Correlated Metals, Superconductivity, and Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on twisted van der Waals materials, we perform an analytical and numerical study of the effects of strong on-site and short-range interactions in fractionally filled ideal Chern bands. We uncover an extensive non-trivial ground state manifold within the band filling range $0 &lt; \nu &lt; 1$ and introduce a general principle, the ''three-rule'', for combining flatband wave functions, which governs their zero-energy property on the torus geometry. Based on the structure of these wave functions, we develop a variational approach that reveals distinct phases under different perturbations: metallic behavior emerges from a finite dispersion, and superconductivity is induced by attractive Cooper channel interactions. Our approach, not reliant on the commonly applied mean-field approximations, provides an analytical expression for the macroscopic wave function of the off-diagonal long-range order correlator, attributing pairing susceptibility to the set of non-trivial zero-energy ground state wave functions. Extending to finite screening lengths and beyond the ideal limit using exact diagonalization simulations, we demonstrate the peculiar structure in the many-body wave function's coefficients to be imprinted in the low-energy spectrum of the topologically ordered Halperin spin-singlet state. Our findings also make connections to frustration-free models of non-commuting projector Hamiltonians, potentially aiding the future construction of exact ground states for various fractional fillings.</description>

      <title>Receivers for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the receiver architecture for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) Mission, designed to reveal the photon ring of black holes. The primary instrument is a dual-polarization receiver operating over the 240-320 GHz frequency range, utilizing a Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) mixer. This Double-Side-Band (DSB) receiver has an intermediate frequency (IF) range of 4-12 GHz and operates at a bath temperature of 4.5 K, for optimal performance, which necessitates the integration of a cryocooler. Complementing the primary receiver is a secondary unit covering the 80-106 GHz spectrum, featuring a cryogenic low noise amplifier. This secondary receiver, affixed to the 20 K stage of the cryocooler, serves to augment the SIS receiver performance by employing the Frequency Phase Transfer technique to boost the signal-to-noise ratio at the correlator output. Together, this sophisticated receiver duo is engineered to achieve the quantum-limited sensitivity required to detect the photon ring of black holes, marking a breakthrough in astrophysical observation.</description>

      <title>Gate voltage modulation of the superconducting state in a degenerate semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the modulation of carrier density can alter the superconducting transition temperature by up to $204$ mK in epitaxial Indium Nitride on Gallium Nitride, accounting for the $10$% of the transition temperature in ungated conditions. Our samples are likely free from strong localization effects and significant granularity, as indicated by $( k_{f l} \gg 1 )$, suggesting that the primary determinant of the transition temperature in InN is carrier density, rather than disorder scattering. The observed behavior is consistent with BCS s-wave superconductivity, corroborated by the superconducting parameters we measured. Furthermore, we observed a $60$% bipolar suppression of the supercurrent in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Integration of through-sapphire substrate machining with superconducting quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a sapphire machining process integrated with intermediate-scale quantum processors. The process allows through-substrate electrical connections, necessary for low-frequency mode-mitigation, as well as signal-routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High-coherence qubits are required to build fault-tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low-loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high-coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium-nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep-silicon etching to create through-substrate-vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small-scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, we present a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high-coherence qubits. This technique immediately provides a means to scale QPUs with integrated mode-mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through-sapphire-vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire-compatible materials for large-scale QPUs.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling behavior of resistivity under two-dimensional superconducting phase fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In superconductors with relatively low superfluid density, such as cuprate high-$T_c$ superconductors, the phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter are remarkable, presumably playing a nonnegligible role in shaping many distinctive physical properties. This work systematically investigates the electrical transport properties arising from thermal superconducting phase fluctuations in two-dimensional superconductors. Employing the Monte Carlo procedure, we access the numerically exact properties of a microscopic model of superconductivity, in which the classical XY model governs the thermal phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter. For both $s$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairings, the electrical resistivity exhibits a universal scaling behavior in the temperature range above $T_c$. Our numerical results demonstrate that the scaling behavior of the quasiparticle lifetime is associated with the correlation length of the superconducting order parameter, yielding the universal scaling behavior of electrical resistivity determined by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical scaling of the correlation length. Furthermore, we discuss the dependence of the electrical resistivity coefficient on the pairing amplitude and the possible implication on recent transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum Griffiths singularity in bulk iron-pnictide superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) is a phenomenon driven by quenched disorders that break conventional scaling invariance and result in a divergent dynamical critical exponent during quantum phase transitions (QPT). While this phenomenon has been well-documented in low-dimensional conventional superconductors and in three-dimensional (3D) magnetic metal systems, its presence in 3D superconducting systems and in unconventional high-temperature superconductors (high-Tc SCs) remains unclear. In this study, we report the observation of robust QGS in the superconductor-metal transition (SMT) of both quasi-2D and 3D anisotropic unconventional high-Tc superconductor CaFe1-xNixAsF (x &lt; 5%) bulk single crystals, where the QGS states persist to up to 5.3 K. A comprehensive quantum phase diagram is established that delineates the 3D anisotropic QGS of SMT induced by perpendicular and parallel magnetic field. Our findings reveal the universality of QGS in 3D superconducting systems and unconventional high-Tc SCs, thereby substantially expanding the range of applicability of QGS.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling in copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent reports of room-temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity in copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite, commonly referred to as LK99, have prompted numerous theoretical and experimental studies into its properties. As the electron-phonon interaction is a common mechanism for superconductivity, the electron-phonon coupling strength is an important quantity to compute for LK99. In this work, we compare the electron-phonon coupling strength among the proposed compositions of LK99. The results of our study are in alignment with the conclusion that LK99 is not a likely candidate for room-temperature superconductivity if electron-phonon interaction is to serve as the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with short- and long-range p-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with short-range, as well as long-range p-wave pairing. Here, the non-Hermiticity is introduced through the onsite potential. A comprehensive analysis of several critical aspects of this system is conducted, which includes eigenspectra, topological properties, localization properties, and the transition from real to complex energies. Specifically, we observe the emergence of Majorana zero modes in the case of short-range pairing, whereas massive Dirac modes emerge in the case of long-range pairing. More importantly, for the case of short-range pairing, we observe two simultaneous phase transitions or double phase transitions: topological and multifractal to localized phase. On the other hand, in the case of the long-range pairing, the topological and multifractal to localized transitions do not coincide. However, for both ranges of pairing, we identify a double phase transition where delocalized (or metallic) to a critical multifractal state is accompanied by an unconventional shift from real to complex energies. Unlike the short-range pairing case, we observe mobility edges in the long-range pairing case.</description>
