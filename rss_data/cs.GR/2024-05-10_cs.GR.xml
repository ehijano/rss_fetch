      <title>DragGaussian: Enabling Drag-style Manipulation on 3D Gaussian Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User-friendly 3D object editing is a challenging task that has attracted significant attention recently. The limitations of direct 3D object editing without 2D prior knowledge have prompted increased attention towards utilizing 2D generative models for 3D editing. While existing methods like Instruct NeRF-to-NeRF offer a solution, they often lack user-friendliness, particularly due to semantic guided editing. In the realm of 3D representation, 3D Gaussian Splatting emerges as a promising approach for its efficiency and natural explicit property, facilitating precise editing tasks. Building upon these insights, we propose DragGaussian, a 3D object drag-editing framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging diffusion models for interactive image editing with open-vocabulary input. This framework enables users to perform drag-based editing on pre-trained 3D Gaussian object models, producing modified 2D images through multi-view consistent editing. Our contributions include the introduction of a new task, the development of DragGaussian for interactive point-based 3D editing, and comprehensive validation of its effectiveness through qualitative and quantitative experiments.</description>

      <title>A Study on Cognitive Effects of Canvas Size for Augmenting Drawing Skill</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the field of generative artificial intelligence, particularly in the domain of image generation, has exerted a profound influence on society. Despite the capability of AI to produce images of high quality, the augmentation of users' drawing abilities through the provision of drawing support systems emerges as a challenging issue. In this study, we propose that a cognitive factor, specifically, the size of the canvas, may exert a considerable influence on the outcomes of imitative drawing sketches when utilizing reference images. To investigate this hypothesis, a web based drawing interface was utilized, designed specifically to evaluate the effect of the canvas size's proportionality to the reference image on the fidelity of the drawings produced. The findings from our research lend credence to the hypothesis that a drawing interface, featuring a canvas whose dimensions closely match those of the reference image, markedly improves the precision of user-generated sketches.</description>

      <title>GDGS: Gradient Domain Gaussian Splatting for Sparse Representation of Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 3D Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, they work directly on the signal, leading to a dense representation of the signal. Even with some techniques such as pruning or distillation, the results are still dense. In this paper, we propose to model the gradient of the original signal. The gradients are much sparser than the original signal. Therefore, the gradients use much less Gaussian splats, leading to the more efficient storage and thus higher computational performance during both training and rendering. Thanks to the sparsity, during the view synthesis, only a small mount of pixels are needed, leading to much higher computational performance ($100\sim 1000\times$ faster). And the 2D image can be recovered from the gradients via solving a Poisson equation with linear computation complexity. Several experiments are performed to confirm the sparseness of the gradients and the computation performance of the proposed method. The method can be applied various applications, such as human body modeling and indoor environment modeling.</description>

      <title>Free-Moving Object Reconstruction and Pose Estimation with Virtual Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach for reconstructing free-moving object from a monocular RGB video. Most existing methods either assume scene prior, hand pose prior, object category pose prior, or rely on local optimization with multiple sequence segments. We propose a method that allows free interaction with the object in front of a moving camera without relying on any prior, and optimizes the sequence globally without any segments. We progressively optimize the object shape and pose simultaneously based on an implicit neural representation. A key aspect of our method is a virtual camera system that reduces the search space of the optimization significantly. We evaluate our method on the standard HO3D dataset and a collection of egocentric RGB sequences captured with a head-mounted device. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms most methods significantly, and is on par with recent techniques that assume prior information.</description>

      <title>Distilling Diffusion Models into Conditional GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to distill a complex multistep diffusion model into a single-step conditional GAN student model, dramatically accelerating inference, while preserving image quality. Our approach interprets diffusion distillation as a paired image-to-image translation task, using noise-to-image pairs of the diffusion model's ODE trajectory. For efficient regression loss computation, we propose E-LatentLPIPS, a perceptual loss operating directly in diffusion model's latent space, utilizing an ensemble of augmentations. Furthermore, we adapt a diffusion model to construct a multi-scale discriminator with a text alignment loss to build an effective conditional GAN-based formulation. E-LatentLPIPS converges more efficiently than many existing distillation methods, even accounting for dataset construction costs. We demonstrate that our one-step generator outperforms cutting-edge one-step diffusion distillation models - DMD, SDXL-Turbo, and SDXL-Lightning - on the zero-shot COCO benchmark.</description>
