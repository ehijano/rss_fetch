      <title>Crystal Systems Classification of Phosphate-Based Cathode Materials Using Machine Learning for Lithium-Ion Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical and chemical characteristics of cathodes used in batteries are derived from the lithium-ion phosphate cathodes crystalline arrangement, which is pivotal to the overall battery performance. Therefore, the correct prediction of the crystal system is essential to estimate the properties of cathodes. This study applies machine learning classification algorithms for predicting the crystal systems, namely monoclinic, orthorhombic, and triclinic, related to Li P (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, V) O based Phosphate cathodes. The data used in this work is extracted from the Materials Project. Feature evaluation showed that cathode properties depend on the crystal structure, and optimized classification strategies lead to better predictability. Ensemble machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Gradient Boosting Machines have demonstrated the best predictive capabilities for crystal systems in the Monte Carlo cross-validation test. Additionally, sequential forward selection (SFS) is performed to identify the most critical features influencing the prediction accuracy for different machine learning models, with Volume, Band gap, and Sites as input features ensemble machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (80.69%), Extremely Randomized Tree (78.96%), and Gradient Boosting Machine (80.40%) approaches lead to the maximum accuracy towards crystallographic classification with stability and the predicted materials can be the potential cathode materials for lithium ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Programmable Beam Control for Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy and Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable electron-beam scanning offers new opportunities to improve dose efficiency and suppress scan-induced artifacts in scanning transmission electron microscopy. Here, we systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster trajectories, including spiral and multi-pass sequential patterns, on two dose sensitive techniques: electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and ptychography. Using DyScO3 as a model perovskite, we compare spatial resolution, spectral fidelity, and artifact suppression across scan modes. Ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieve atomic resolution and remain robust to large jumps in probe position. In contrast, atomic-resolution EELS maps show pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Finally, spiral scanning applied under cryogenic conditions in BaTiO3 thin films improves dose uniformity and mitigates drift related distortions. These results establish practical guidelines for the implementation of programmable scan strategies in low-dose 4D-STEM and highlight the inherent resilience of ptychography to trajectory-induced artifacts.</description>

      <title>Achieving fully-compensated ferrimagnetism through two-dimensional heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to altermagnets, fully-compensated ferrimagnets are another category of collinear magnetic materials that possess zero-net total magnetic moment and exhibit spin-splitting, making them promising for low-energy spintronics, high-density data storage and high-sensitivity sensors. Although many methods, such as alloying, external electric field, Janus engineering, ferroelectric field and spin ordering, have been proposed to achieve fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, these approaches either face experimental difficulties or produce a small spin-splitting or are volatile. Here, we propose to form vertical heterostructures by stacking two different but equally magnetized two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials. If an A-type antiferromagnetic ordering is satisfied, a fully compensated ferrimagnet can be formed. This vertical heterostructure approach is insensitive to lattice matching and stacking manner, thus being more conducive to experimental realization. Through first-principles calculations, we verify our proposal with several examples, focusing in particular on $\mathrm{CrI_3}$/$\mathrm{CrGeTe_3}$ heterojunction composed of experimentally synthesized $\mathrm{CrI_3}$ and $\mathrm{CrGeTe_3}$ monolayers. The calculations show that $\mathrm{CrI_3}$/$\mathrm{CrGeTe_3}$ is a fully-compensated ferrimagnet, with pronounced spin-splitting, and that tensile strain is more favorable for achieving fully-compensated ferrimagnetism. Our work provides an experimentally feasible strategy for realizing fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, thereby further advancing the development of this field.</description>

      <title>Topology-Driven Vibrations in a Chiral Polar Vortex Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ordering of magnetic or electric dipoles leading to real-space topological structures is at the forefront of materials research as their quantum mechanical nature often lends itself to emergent properties. Atomic lattice vibrations (phonons) are often a key contributor to the formation of long-range dipole textures based on ferroelectrics and impact the properties of the emergent phases. Here, using monochromated, momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (qEELS) with nanometer spatial resolution and meV-spectral-precision, we demonstrate that polar vortex lattices in PbTiO$_3$ spatially modulate the material's vibrational spectrum in patterns that directly reflect the overlying symmetry of the topological patterns. Moreover, by combining experiments with molecular dynamics simulations using machine learned potentials we reveal how these structures modify phonon modes across the vibrational spectrum. Beyond simple intensity modulation, we find that the chirality of the vortex topology imparts its unique symmetry onto phonons, producing a distinctive asymmetrical spectral shift across the vortex unit cell. Finally, the high spatial resolution of the technique enables topological defects to be probed directly, demonstrating a return to trivial PbTiO$_3$ modes at vortex dislocation cores. These findings establish a fundamental relationship between ferroelectric-ordering-induced topologies and phonon behavior, opening new avenues for engineering thermal transport, electron-phonon coupling, and other phonon-mediated properties in next-generation nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Sinusoidal Displacement Describes Disorder in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder is an intrinsic feature of all solids, from crystals of atoms to superlattices of colloidal nanoparticles. Unlike atomic crystals, in nanocrystal superlattices a single misplaced particle can affect the positions of neighbors over long distances, leading to cumulative disorder. This elusive form of collective particle displacement leaves clear signatures in diffraction, but little is known about how it accumulates and propagates throughout the superlattice. Here we rationalize propagation and accumulation of disorder in a series of CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices by using synchrotron grazing incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals of colloidal softness S in the range of 0.3-0.7 were obtained by preparing particles with different sizes and ligand mixtures, consisting of oleic acid and primary amines of variable lengths. Most diffraction patterns showed clear signatures of anisotropic disorder, with multilayer diffraction characteristics of high structural coherence visible only for the {100} axial directions and lost in all other directions. As the softness decreased, the superlattices transitioned to a more ordered regime where small-angle diffraction peaks became resolution-limited, and superlattice multilayer diffraction appeared for the (110) diagonal reflections. To rationalize these anisotropies in structural coherence and their dependence on superlattice softness, we propose a sinusoidal displacement model where longitudinal and transverse displacements modulate nanocrystal positions. The model explains experimental observations and advances the understanding of disorder in mesocrystalline systems as they approach the limits of structural perfection.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence of NV Color Centers in Diamond p-i-n Diodes mediated by Charge-state Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the electroluminescence (EL) of NV color centers in diamond has been realized in p-i-n diodes,the underlying mechanism remains a puzzle for longer than a decade. In this study,using first-principles approaches,the electronic configurations and the possible transitions are comprehensively investigated. Based on the calculated carrier cross sections and transition rates,the mechanism of the EL of NV centers and the charge-state dynamics are revealed. The continuous EL is maintained by the cycle of NV0 ground (GNV0),NV+ metastable (MNV+) and NV0 excited state (ENV0). The weaker EL intensity compared to photoluminescence (PL) is explained by the bottleneck transition from MNV+ to ENV0 and another non-luminescent transition cycle. Additionally,our results also explain the disappearance of the luminescence of NV- as a result of unbalanced transitions between NV- and NV0. This study not only reveal the mechanism of electroluminescence of NV centers and explain experimental observations,but also provide first-principles insights to understand the charge-dynamics of other color centers under electric and optical field.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Twirls and Structural Frustration in Moir\'e Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural twirls form spontaneously in the domain wall networks of some moir\'e materials. We show that in heterobilayers, neighboring twirl chiralities tend to anti-align, forming staggered patterns that are well described by antiferromagnetic lattice $\phi^4$ theories. In moir\'e systems with triangular domains, this leads to frustration in the chirality configuration of the structural twirls and to hysteresis with respect to variation of the average twist angle and possibly other control parameters.</description>

      <title>Amorphization-Mediated Si-I to Si-V Phase Transition and Reversible Amorphous-Si-V Phase Memory in Silicon Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations using a Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) reveal a stress triaxiality driven, two-step Si-I (diamond cubic) to Si-V (simple hexagonal) phase transition pathway in a spherical Si nanoparticle with a 10 nm diameter under triaxial compression. A transient amorphous phase first forms at the surface and propagates inward around Si-I core, where stress triaxiality is low (shear-dominated). Within the amorphous shell, the material recrystallizes into Si-V at locations of elevated stress triaxiality and hydrostatic pressure. The resulting Si-V structure transforms into a fully amorphous state upon unloading. A subsequent loading-unloading cycle applied to this amorphous nanoparticle reveals a reversible amorphous to Si-V transformation, demonstrating a nanoscale phase memory effect.</description>

      <title>Synergetic Enhancement of Power Factors and Suppression of Lattice Thermal Conductivities via Biaxial Strain in ScAgSe$_2$ and TmAgTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of achieving high thermoelectric (TE) performance is mainly from the entanglement among Seebeck coefficient ($S$), electrical conductivity ($\sigma$), and lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$). In this work, we propose a synergetic strategy of enhancing power factor (PF, $S^2\sigma$) and suppressing $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ by applying a biaxial tensile strain in two silver chalcogenides ScAgSe$_2$ and TmAgTe$_2$ with TlCdS$_2$-type structure. The forbidden $p$-$d$ orbital coupling at the $\Gamma$ point and allowed $p$-$d$ orbital coupling at the A point and the middle of $\Lambda$ line leads to high electronic band dispersion along the $\Gamma$-A direction and a high-degeneracy valence band valley ($\Lambda_2$). The elongation of the Ag-Se bond under tensile strain weakens the orbital coupling between Ag-$d$ and Se/Te-$p$ orbitals and reduces the band energy at the A point, which aligns the valence band and achieving a high band degeneracy. Concurrently, the weaker Ag-Se/Ag-Te bond under a small tensile strain leads to lower phonon group velocity and strong three- and four phonon scatterings, leading to lower $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$. Our first-principles calculations combined with electron-phonon coupling analysis as well as phonon and electron Boltzmann transport equations show that applying a 3\% (2\%) tensile strain can enhance the PF along the $c$-axis of ScAgSe$_2$ (TmAgTe$_2$) by 243\% (246\%) at a carrier concentration of 3$\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ and reduce the $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ by 37\% (26\%) at 300 K. Consequently, 2 $\sim$ 4 times of $ZT$ enhancement is obtained by 3\% or 1\% tensile strain in ScAgSe$_2$ (TmAgTe$_2$) at 300 K, achieving a maximum $ZT$ of 3.10 (3.62) at 800 K. Our material design strategy based on molecular orbital analysis reveals an effective route to boosting TE performance, and can be extended to other systems as well.</description>

      <title>Dislocation response to electric fields in strontium titanate: A mesoscale indentation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations in perovskite oxides have drawn increasing research interest due to their potential of tuning functional properties of electroceramics. Open questions remain regarding the behavior of dislocations concerning their stability under strong externally applied electric fields. In this study, we investigate the dielectric breakdown strength of nominally undoped SrTiO3 crystals after the introduction of high-density dislocations. The dislocation-rich samples are prepared using the Brinell scratching method, and they consistently exhibit lower dielectric breakdown strength as well as a larger scatter in the breakdown probability. We also study the impact of electric field on the introduction and movement of dislocations in SrTiO3 crystals using Brinell indentation coupled with an electric field of 2 kV/mm. No changes on the dislocation plastic zone size, depth, and dislocation distribution are observed under this electric field. Based on the charge state of the dislocations in SrTiO3 as well as the electrical and thermal conductivity modified by dislocations, we discuss the forces induced by the electric field to act on the dislocations to underline the possible mechanisms for such dislocation behavior.</description>

      <title>"Adiabatic" Elastic Constants in Hubbard-Corrected Density-Functional Theory DFT+U: case UO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since in DFT+U there are multiple self-consistent electronic solutions, the so called metastable states, the elastic constants computed from stress-vs-strain will be incorrect if some of the strained configurations fall into a different local electronic minimum than the equilibrium non-strained state. So, it is crucial to carefully take steps to keep the same electronic Hubbard occupation branch when computing the stresses for small strained geometries. In this work, we have explained this "adiabatic" method of calculation for elastic constants and applied for UO$_2$ crystal described within two different unit cells of cubic 12-atom and tetragonal 6-atom basis sets. The calculation results for the two different unit cells are the same within 0.1 GPa, and agreement with experiment is excellent.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Clusters in Kagome Weyl Semimetal Co3Sn2S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impurities and intrinsic point defects, which profoundly influence spin, charge, and topological degrees of freedom, are crucial parameters for tuning quantum states in quantum materials. The magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 with its strong spin-orbit coupling, intrinsic ferromagnetism, and kagome lattice of correlated electrons, provides a compelling platform for studying impurity excited states. Yet, the role of intrinsic impurities in shaping its quantum states remains elusive. Here, we uncover intrinsic quantum clusters-localized intrinsic point defects that act as tunable quantum perturbations capable of reshaping electronic states and order parameters, on the surface of Co3Sn2S2 via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non contact atomic force microscopy, combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy. These clusters are identified as native oxygen defects that dominate the intrinsic defect landscape on both cleaved surface terminations. On the Sn-terminated surface, oxygen impurities occupy hollow sites between three Sn atoms, and tune the flat band near the Fermi level, which exhibits orbital magnetism induced unconventional Zeeman effect under an applied magnetic field. On the S-terminated surface, oxygen interstitials reside slightly off center relative to the S lattice and generate occupied impurity states that retain sixfold symmetry at higher energies but reduce to C2 symmetry at lower energies. In contrast, these impurity states show no measurable magnetic response. Our findings establish that intrinsic oxygen-related quantum clusters act as tunable local perturbations in a topological kagome magnet, offering a versatile platform to probe and engineer impurity-driven phenomena in correlated and topological systems.</description>

      <title>Achieving DFT accuracy in short range ordering and stacking fault energy using moment tensor potential for CoCrFeNi and CoCrNi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) such as CoCrFeNi and CoCrNi are promising structural materials owing to their outstanding mechanical and thermal properties, which arise from complex chemical disorder and atomic-scale interactions. Although density functional theory (DFT) has provided fundamental insights into these systems, its high computational cost limits exploration of large-scale phenomena. Classical interatomic potentials have been used to address this gap but often lack the fidelity needed to capture many-body interactions and chemical short-range ordering (CSRO) effects. In this work, we developed a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to bridge accuracy and efficiency. The MTP was trained on a comprehensive DFT database spanning unary to quaternary configurations and reproduces energies, forces, and stresses with near-DFT accuracy across diverse structural and chemical environments. It accurately predicts elastic properties and recovers compositional trends in bulk and shear moduli in agreement with DFT. Hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations capture CSRO, reproducing key DFT-reported features including Cr-Cr and Fe-Fe repulsion and Ni-Cr ordering. Stacking fault energetics were modeled, yielding ISF energies near 54 mJ/m2 for CoCrNi and 36 mJ/m2 for CoCrFeNi, consistent with DFT predictions. Local chemical environment effects on stacking faults were also resolved: Co-rich planes reduce, whereas Cr- or Fe-rich planes increase, the stacking fault energy. By enabling large-scale, high-fidelity simulations at a fraction of DFT's cost, the developed MTP provides a robust framework for predictive modeling of thermodynamic stability, defect behavior, and mechanical response of FCC MEAs.</description>

      <title>Pristine and transition metal doped 2D AlSb as high performance electrocatalyst for selective CO2 reduction: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) using 2D nanomaterials has emerged as a sophisticated approach to mitigate industrial CO2 emissions. In this work, the potential application of pristine as well as strategically Fe, Co, Ni-doped 2D AlSb was examined as a CO2RR electrocatalyst. The recation pathways of CO2RR intermediate complexes, overpotential, stability, efficiency, and selectivity were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Outstanding overpotentials were achieved with pristine and doped 2D AlSb: Ni-doped 2D AlSb was selective for HCOOH (0.12eV) and CH4 (0.28eV), and Fe-doped 2D AlSb for HCHO (0.31eV) and CH3OH (0.31eV). The opposing effects of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was mitigated with the application of electric potential and solution pH. The main reasons for the enhancement of catalytic effect due to doping with Fe, Co, and Ni are bandgap reduction and creation of states at the edge of the valence band due to the 3d orbitals of these dopants. Interestingly, the Fe-doped 2D AlSb catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity. Excellent electrocatalytic properties of pristine and doped 2D AlSb make them suitable as CO2RR catalysts contributing towards a green and sustainable energy ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Si-Substituted MAX Phases and In-Situ Formation of Si-coated MXene Composites via Chlorosilane Etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon-based MAX phases are a promising class of layered ceramics with superior thermal and chemical stability. However, their synthesis remains challenging due to inherent thermodynamic instability at high temperatures. Herein, we develop a general top-down strategy to synthesize a broad family of Si-substituted MAX phases (M = Ti, V, Nb, Ta, Cr; X = C, N) by reacting Al-based MAX precursors with SiCl4 vapor. This approach not only circumvents traditional high-temperature limitations but also enables precise A-site defect engineering, resulting in phases with controlled vacancy concentrations (e.g., Nb2Si3/4C and Nb2Si1/2C). Furthermore, we introduce a redox potential-based model that rationalizes the reaction pathway. Using Tin+1AlXn etched with SiCl4 as an example, the process simultaneously forms Cl-terminated MXene (Mn+1XnCl2) and amorphous nano-Si, enabling the one-step synthesis of Si-coated MXene composites. This methodology provides new avenues for designing advanced MAX phases and MXene-based hybrids with tailored functionalities for applications in energy storage and catalysis.</description>

      <title>Geometric Analysis of Magnetic Labyrinthine Stripe Evolution via U-Net Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labyrinthine stripe patterns are common in many physical systems, yet their lack of long-range order makes quantitative characterization challenging. We investigate the evolution of such patterns in bismuth-doped yttrium iron garnet (Bi:YIG) films subjected to a magnetic field annealing protocol. A U-Net deep learning model, trained with synthetic degradations including additive white Gaussian and Simplex noise, enables robust segmentation of experimental magneto-optical images despite noise and occlusions. Building on this segmentation, we develop a geometric analysis pipeline based on skeletonization, graph mapping, and spline fitting, which quantifies local stripe propagation through length and curvature measurements. Applying this framework to 444 images from 12 annealing protocol trials, we analyze the transition from the "quenched" state to a more parallel and coherent "annealed" state, and identify two distinct evolution modes (Type A and Type B) linked to field polarity. Our results provide a quantitative analysis of geometric and topological properties in magnetic stripe patterns and offer new insights into their local structural evolution, and establish a general tool for analyzing complex labyrinthine systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hybridization-Driven Stabilization and Reactivity on an Asymmetrically Reconstructed Polar CeO2(100) Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomic structure of polar oxide surfaces is essential for unraveling surface reactivilty and designing advanced catalytic materials. Among these, the polar CeO2(100) surface is a prototypical and industrially important system in heterogeneous catalysis. However, due to the vast complexity of the surface configurations, its reconstruction behavior remains an open question. Here, we report a previously unidentified asymmetric (1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO2(100) surface, discovered through an integrated approach that combines global structure search algorithms, machine learning-based atomic potential models, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The reconstructed surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically stable, characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions, increased interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. Importantly, the formation of localized Ce3+ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, resulting in new occupied electronic states below the Fermi level. This orbital hybridization activates the O 2p states, enhances their electron-donating capacity, and facilitates the dissociation of adsorbed molecules such as H2O. These findings reveal a fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism by which surface reconstruction governs electronic structure and reactivity, offering critical insights and a new design strategy for tuning catalytic performance on polar oxide surfaces.</description>

      <title>Controlled growth of polar altermagnets via chemical vapor transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetic properties have been recently proposed in polar magnetic oxides, M$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), where improved characteristics of stronger magnetoelectric coupling and higher magnetic transition temperatures were observed. Thus, understanding their microscopic origins is of fundamental and technological importance. However, the difficulty in growing large single crystals hinders detailed experimental studies. Here, we report the successful growth of large single crystals of the pyroelectric antiferromagnet using two representative compounds, Fe$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ and NiZnMo$_{3}$O$_{8}$. Growth was optimized using various parameters, finding the transport agent density as a primary factor, which depends strongly on the position of the pellet, the starting powder form, and the volume of the ampule. We demonstrated a controlled growth method by manipulating the convection and diffusion kinetics. High-quality crystals were characterized by using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Laue diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and Raman spectroscopy. Manipulation of magnetic properties through nonmagnetic Zn doping was shown in NiZnMo$_{3}$O$_{8}$. Our results enable the detailed investigation and manipulation of their unconventional altermagnetic and multiferroic properties. This study provides crucial insight into the controlled growth of other functional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Effects of training machine-learning potentials for radiation damage simulations using different pseudopotentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a commonplace approach in the development of interatomic potentials for molecular dynamics simulations, and its use also for radiation effect modelling is increasing. In this work, we investigate the effects of training ML potentials to density functional theory data calculated with different pseudopotentials in nickel. We look in detail at the differences that appear in radiation damage simulations. The use of a "harder" pseudopotential with semicore electrons has a direct impact on the short-range interactions, which in turn has implications on the radiation damage simulations. We find that despite these differences, the average threshold displacement energy is quite similar (40-50 eV for Ni). However, we find significant differences in the cumulative damage predicted by massively overlapping cascade simulations and compare them with Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy/channeling experiments. We also investigate approaches to modify the repulsive pair interactions after training the potentials and discuss the feasibility of such approaches.</description>

      <title>Descriptor and Graph-based Molecular Representations in Prediction of Copolymer Properties Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copolymers are highly versatile materials with a vast range of possible chemical compositions. By using computational methods for property prediction, the design of copolymers can be accelerated, allowing for the prioritization of candidates with favorable properties. In this study, we utilized two distinct representations of molecular ensembles to predict the seven different physical polymer properties copolymers using machine learning: we used a random forest (RF) model to predict polymer properties from molecular descriptors, and a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the same properties from 2D polymer graphs under both a single- and multi-task setting. To train and evaluate the models, we constructed a data set from molecular dynamic simulations for 140 binary copolymers with varying monomer compositions and configurations. Our results demonstrate that descriptors-based RFs excel at predicting density and specific heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp) and volume (Cv) because these properties are strongly tied to specific molecular features captured by molecular descriptors. In contrast, graph representations better predict expansion coefficients ({\gamma}, {\alpha}) and bulk modulus (K), which depend more on complex structural interactions better captured by graph-based models. This study underscores the importance of choosing appropriate representations for predicting molecular properties. Our findings demonstrate how machine learning models can expedite copolymer discovery with learnable structure-property relationships, streamlining polymer design and advancing the development of high-performance materials for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Chiral Phonons in MnPS$_3$ from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials may host circular phonons, considered as chiral if the presence of a substrate breaks mirror symmetry. In 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers lacking inversion symmetry, phonons with a given chirality can be observed in the non-equilibrium state triggered by optical excitations using circularly polarized light. Backed by first-principles calculations, we present the antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnPS$_3$ with a hexagonal crystal structure and bandstructure similar to TMDCs, but a larger unit cell, as a novel candidate material that may allow for excitation of circular phonons. Using DFT+U and the finite displacement method we obtain in-plane chiral phonon modes at the valley points of a monolayer MnPS$_3$. These modes can be classified according to the Mn or S atoms performing circular motions about their equilibrium positions. In each case, the quantized angular momentum of the phonons is calculated. Moreover, we point out ways to populate the chiral phonons selectively via optical excitation with circularly polarized light.</description>

      <title>Orchestration of Heterogeneous Experimental Machines via ROS2 for Automated Bulk Intermetallic Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advances in informatics applied to materials science, predicting the physical properties of numerous materials has become increasingly feasible, creating a growing demand for their experimental validation. It has been expected that the integration of robotic systems into experimental materials science excels at efficiently performing repetitive and time-consuming tasks without the need for human intervention, thus significantly increasing throughput and reducing the risk of human error, while there have been a limited number of reports tackled the synthesis process of solid bulk material so far possibly because of the complex as well as a wide variety of processes to deal with. In this paper, we report an automated arc melting system controlled by a robot operating system2 (ROS2). Taking advantage of ROS2, we have constructed a machine that can handle multiple experimental apparatuses simultaneously with flexibility for future expansion of functions. The constructed machine is capable of not only performing repeated operation of a specific process but also dealing with multiple elements for synthesis of intermetallic compounds. The system is expected to accelerate experimental validation of data-driven materials exploration.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Magnetic Anisotropy Energy of MoS$_2$-supported Mn$_{12}$ complexes by Electric Field: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine low-energy adsorption configurations of four dodecanuclear manganese single-molecule magnets [Mn$_{12}$O$_{12}$(O$_2$CR)$_{16}$(H$_2$O)$_4$] (Mn$_{12}$), where the ligand R being H, CH$_3$, CHCl$_2$ or C$_6$H$_5$, on a molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) monolayer using force field and density functional theory calculations. The van der Waals interaction is shown to be crucial for determining the adsorption energy. Some electrons transfer from the substrate to the molecules upon surface adsorption, resulting in a reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy of Mn$_{12}$. Since the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of Mn$_{12}$ is close to the valence band of MoS$_2$, a negative electric field is more effective in modulating charge transfer and energy band alignment, and thus altering the magnetic anisotropy energy, compared with a positive electric field. A significant increase in the magnetic anisotropy energy of Mn$_{12}$ with the ligand R=CHCl$_2$ or R=C$_6$H$_5$ under a sufficiently high electric field has been predicted. Our calculations show that the molecules remain intact on the surface both before and after the electric field is applied. Finally, a two-level system formed by different adsorption configurations is evaluated, and the tunability of its energy barrier under an electric field is demonstrated. Our study sheds light on tuning the properties of single-molecule magnets using an electric field, when the molecules are supported on a surface.</description>

      <title>Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is an important method for imaging beam sensitive materials often under cryo conditions. Electron ptychography in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has been shown to reconstruct low-noise phase data at a reduced fluence for such materials. This raises the question of whether ptychography or HRTEM provides a more fluence-efficient imaging technique. Even though the transfer function is a common metric for evaluating the performance of an imaging method, it only describes the signal transfer with respect to spatial frequency, irrespective of the noise transfer. It can also not well defined for methods, such as ptychography, that use an algorithm to form the final image. Here we apply the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron microscopy as a fluence independent and sample independent measure of technique performance. We find that, for a weak-phase object, ptychography can never reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but that ptychography is more robust to partial coherence.</description>

      <title>Calibrating a Finite-strain Phase-field Model of Fracture for Bonded Granular Materials with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study the mechanical behavior of mock high explosives, an experimental and simulation program was developed to calibrate, with quantified uncertainty, a material model of the bonded granular material Idoxuridine and nitroplasticized Estane-5703. This paper reports on the efficacy of such a framework as a generalizable methodology for calibrating material models against experimental data with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, this paper studies the effect of two manufacturing temperatures and three initial granular configurations on the unconfined compressive behavior of the resulting bonded granular materials. In each of these cases, the same calibration framework was used; in that, hundreds of high-fidelity direct numerical simulations using a new, GPU-enabled, high-performance finite element method software, Ratel, were run to calibrate a finite-strain phase-field fracture model against experimental data. It was found that manufacturing temperature influenced the elastic response of the mock high explosives, with higher temperatures yielding a stiffer response. By contrast, it was found that the initial configuration of the grains had a negligible impact on the overall behavior of the mock high explosives, though it remains possible that local damage accumulation within the specimens could be altered by the initial configurations. Overall, the calibration framework was successful at creating well-calibrated models, showing its usefulness as an engineering and scientific tool.</description>

      <title>A new skyrmion topological transition driven by higher-order exchange interactions in Janus MnSeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets offer a promising platform for pushing skyrmion technology to the single-layer limit with high tunability. While Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is often recognized as central to skyrmion formation, their stability, collapse, and topological transition in 2D materials remain largely unexplored. In particular, the effect of higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) on these phenomena is unknown. Here, using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we report a new topological transition generated by HOI, which we term 'ferric transition', in single-layer MnSeTe. Surprisingly, skyrmion stability and collapse remain largely unaffected by HOI due to the dominant role of DMI near the saddle point, whereas the Bloch point is strongly modified, giving rise to this novel transition. This mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the well-known radial and chimera transitions. Moreover, we predict that Janus MnSeTe exhibits remarkably high skyrmion energy barriers due to its strong DMI, among the highest reported for intrinsic 2D magnets. Our findings unveil an unexpected role of HOI in skyrmion topological transitions and establish Janus MnSeTe as a robust platform for 2D skyrmionics.</description>

Among these, particle-hole excitations form a particularly important class, as they govern fundamental processes such as screening, dissipation, and transport. In metals, the continuum of electron-hole excitations is described by the Lindhard function. Although central to the theory of Fermi liquids, the corresponding Lindhard continuum has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report its direct observation in the weakly correlated metal MgB$_{2}$ using ultra-soft resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). We resolve a linearly dispersing excitation with velocity comparable to the Fermi velocity and find quantitative agreement with simulations of the non-interacting charge susceptibility. A detailed analysis and decomposition of the simulations reveal the intra-band origin of this low-energy excitation, confirming it as the Lindhard continuum. Our results establish ultra-soft RIXS as a momentum-resolved probe of the fermiology in metals and call for deeper investigations of continuum features in RIXS and related spectroscopy of other materials beyond MgB$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>RKKY interaction mediated by a spin-polarized 2D electron gas with Rashba and altermagnetic coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic interactions between impurity spins play a crucial role in determining magnetic configurations in spintronic systems. Using a Green's function formalism, we investigate Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interactions between two localized spins mediated by a two-dimensional electron gas arising from two spin-polarized bands with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and altermagnetic dispersion. We analyze two distinct regimes: (a) strong out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, and (b) weak in-plane order. For out-of-plane magnetization, the Heisenberg, Ising, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange interaction terms exhibit oscillatory spatial modulations and asymptotically decay as $1/R^{2}$ with impurity separation. Besides, all exchange terms display beating-like patterns that can be tuned via the exchange coupling strength between conduction electrons and ferromagnetic ordering. The DM vector lies within the two-dimensional plane, with the DM interaction being odd in the RSOC strength, oscillatory, and increasing in magnitude with RSOC strength. In contrast, it is even in the out-of-plane Zeeman field strength and oscillatory. Furthermore, the Heisenberg interaction exhibits a non-linear dependence on the altermagnetic band parameter. In the case of weak in-plane order, the Heisenberg exchange interaction shows a non-linear dependence on the in-plane exchange coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Correlated interlayer quantum Hall state in alternating twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved edge transport and excitonic order.</description>

      <title>Bridging Structure and Activity in Nanocatalysts via Machine Learning and Global Structure Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing a mapping between nanocatalysts structure and their catalytic properties is essential for efficient design. To this end, we demonstrate the accuracy of a general machine learning framework on a representative and challenging application: predicting the mass activity of Pt nanoparticles for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, estimated via a microkinetic model. Accurate models are obtained when leveraging either a nanocatalyst's structure representation accessible at the computational level, namely the surface site generalized coordination number distributions, or one accessible experimentally, namely the nanoparticle's pair distance distribution function. Building on this result, we demonstrate that our machine learning model, in tandem with Bayesian optimization, efficiently identifies the Top-10 and Top-100 most active structures out of a large pool of candidates comprising more than 50000 different structures, after probing the activity only of a few thousand structures. These findings provide a robust blueprint for accelerated theoretical and experimental identification of active nanocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Absence of detectable spin and orbital pumping from Ni to Nb by out-of-plane ferromagnetic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited ferromagnets can pump spin angular momentum, along with possibly orbital angular momentum. Among elemental ferromagnets, Ni has been proposed to exhibit substantial orbital pumping relative to spin pumping. Here, we search for a signature of orbital pumping by Ni, specifically by comparing out-of-plane ferromagnetic resonance in heterostructures without Ni (FeV/Nb) and with Ni (FeV-Ni/Nb). The FeV/Nb series shows a clear increase in Gilbert damping with the Nb sink thickness, attributed to spin pumping from FeV to Nb. Surprisingly, the FeV-Ni/Nb series exhibits no such damping increase, revealing no significant spin or orbital pumping from Ni to Nb. Our results offer a fresh perspective on angular-momentum transfer in Ni-based heterostructures, suggesting that the interpretation of some strong orbitronic effects may require further consideration.</description>

      <title>Planar Ballistic Electron Emission Spectroscopy for Single-Shot Probing of Energy Barrier Inhomogeneity at Junction Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental methodology for probing the energy barrier inhomogeneity at the metal/semiconductor interface without the need for time-consuming microscopic survey. It is based on the known statistical nature of the interfacial energy barrier and the use of planar tunnel junction as an array of parallelly-connected ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) tips. In order to analyze a lump of local BEEM signals, we incorporate the Tung model into the Bell-Kaiser theory. To validate our theoretical strategies, we investigate the interfacial energy barrier inhomogeneity of Pt/4H-SiC(0001) junction as a model system.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic ordering and critical behavior induced giant magnetocaloric effect in distorted kagome lattice Gd$_3$BWO$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We synthesize the high-quality Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ single crystal and investigate its lowtemperature magnetic and thermodynamic properties. Below $T\rm_{N}$ = 1.08 K, the anisotropic behavior of magnetic susceptibilities reveals that the Gd$^{3+}$ moments exhibit the dominant antiferromagnetic coupling along the $c$-axis, while displaying a ferromagnetic arrangement in kagome plane. With pronounced magnetic frustration, in adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration experiments starting from initial conditions of 9 T and 2 K, Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ polycrystal reaches a minimum temperature of 0.151 K, significantly lower than its $T\rm_{N}$. Due to the high density of Gd$^{3+}$ ions ($S$=7/2), the maximum magnetic entropy change reaches over 50 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ under fields up to 7 T in Gd$_3$BWO$_9$, nearly 1.5 times as large as commercial sub-Kelvin magnetic coolant Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$(GGG). The H-T phase diagram of Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ under $H$//$c$ exhibits field-induced critical behavior near the phase boundaries. This observation aligns with the theoretical scenario in which a quantum critical point acts as the endpoint of a line of classical second-order phase transitions. Such behavior suggests the importance of further investigations into the divergence of magnetic Gr\"uneisen parameter in the vicinity of critical field at ultralow temperatures.</description>

Abstract: The twice-activation method for analysis of experimental viscosity-temperature data reveals a set of interconnected parameters describing the state of the flowing glass-forming liquid in terms of convergation point which describes an infinite set of viscosity-temperature relations for the liquid considered. The observed uncertainty in the viscosity-temperature behavior permits to consider glass-forming liquid as the self-organizing system realizing by the bonds wave as dissipative pattern. The acoustic bond wave and the switching bond wave are considered generally and in different groups of glass-formers: inorganic, organic and polymers. The demonstrated correlation between two coordinates of convergation point and kinetic and thermodynamic measures of fragility permits to resolve the problem of the measures discrepancy.</description>

      <title>MatQnA: A Benchmark Dataset for Multi-modal Large Language Models in Materials Characterization and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in general domains such as programming and writing, and have demonstrated strong potential in various scientific research scenarios. However, the capabilities of AI models in the highly specialized field of materials characterization and analysis have not yet been systematically or sufficiently validated. To address this gap, we present MatQnA, the first multi-modal benchmark dataset specifically designed for material characterization techniques. MatQnA includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), etc. We employ a hybrid approach combining LLMs with human-in-the-loop validation to construct high-quality question-answer pairs, integrating both multiple-choice and subjective questions. Our preliminary evaluation results show that the most advanced multi-modal AI models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Doubao Vision Pro 32K) have already achieved nearly 90% accuracy on objective questions in materials data interpretation and analysis tasks, demonstrating strong potential for applications in materials characterization and analysis. The MatQnA dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/richardhzgg/matQnA.</description>

      <title>High-resolution electric field imaging based on intermittent-contact mode scanning NV center electrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electrometry has shown potential for quantitative quantum imaging of electric fields at the nanoscale. However, achieving nanoscale spatial resolution remains a challenge since employing gradiometry to overcome electrostatic screening causes resolution-limiting trade-offs including the averaging effect and the sensor-sample proximity. Here, we demonstrate a scanning NV center protocol that achieves an enhanced spatial resolution of approximately 10 nm. We develop an axially symmetric probe with a sub-nanometer oscillating amplitude, which simultaneously provides robust intermittent-contact mode feedback and ensures close engagement between the diamond tip and the sample. As an example, we experimentally demonstrate a 10 nm spatial resolution on ferroelectric lithium niobate. Scanning NV center electrometry with this resolution can directly resolve the nanoscale polar textures and dynamics of emerging ferroelectrics, which commonly arise on the scale of tens of nanometers.</description>

      <title>Integration of $\text{Er}^{3+}$-emitters in silicon-on-insulator nanodisks metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erbium ($\text{Er}^{3+}$) emitters are relevant for optical applications due to their narrow emission line directly in the telecom C-band due to the ${}^\text{4}\text{I}_{\text{13/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${}^\text{4}\text{I}_{\text{15/2}}$ transition at 1.54 $\mu$m. Additionally they are promising candidates for future quantum technologies when embedded in thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) to achieve fabrication scalability and CMOS compatibility. In this paper we integrate $\text{Er}^{3+}$ emitters in SOI metasurfaces made of closely spaced array of nanodisks, to study their spontaneous emission via room and cryogenic temperature confocal microscopy, off-resonance and in-resonance photoluminescence excitation at room temperature and time resolved spectroscopy. This work demonstrates the possibility to adopt CMOS-compatible and fabrication scalable metasurfaces for controlling and improving the collection efficiency of the spontaneous emission from the $\text{Er}^{3+}$ transition in SOI and could be adopted in similar technologically advanced materials.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an extensive survey of the thermal radiation properties of lithium benzoate. We heated the sample from 313 to 553 K, just below the melting point, while performing an infrared spectroradiometry with an FT-IR spectrometer from 21 to 235 THz (700-7800 cm$^{-1}$). We have provided a detailed analysis of the infrared spectrum data and a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the same sample. It turned out that the recorded spectra are not only different from ordinary absorption spectra but also carry substantial information about the temperature dependence of the population of vibrationally excited states. We conclude by proposing a hypothesis on the thermal excitation mechanism of vibrational energy levels of molecules consistent with the distinct characteristics of the obtained infrared emission spectra.</description>

Abstract: We present results of comprehensive first-principles and kp-method studies of electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of graphene on a monolayer of CrI$_3$. First, we identify a twist angle between the graphene and CrI$_3$, that positions the graphene Dirac cones within the bandgap of CrI$_3$. Then, we derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian describing electronic properties of graphene Dirac cones. Subsequently, we examine anomalous and valley Hall conductivity and discuss possible topological phase transition from a quantum anomalous Hall insulator to a trivial insulating state, concomitant a change in the magnetic ground state of CrI$_3$. These findings highlight the potential of strain engineering in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures for controlling topological and magnetic phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) have transformed atomistic simulations, by enabling molecular dynamics simulations with near ab initio accuracy at reduced computational costs and improved scalability. Despite these advances, crafting NNIPs remains complex, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs. Our approach integrates density-functional theory, data augmentation strategies and classical molecular dynamics to systematically explore the potential energy landscape. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against true errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of our active learning strategy, which is shown to minimize both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to relabel with ab initio calculations. The method is validated on the fully automated training of a NNIP for a diverse set of carbon allotropes, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency. This platform democratizes NNIP development, empowering users to achieve high-precision simulations with minimal human intervention.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic and crystal structures of manganese and nickel monoxides have been studied by high-resolution neutron diffraction. The known 1$k$-structures based on the single propagation vector $\left[\tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\right]$ for the parent paramagnetic space group $Fm\bar{3}m$ are forced to have monoclinic magnetic symmetry and are not possible in rhombohedral symmetry. However, the monoclinic distortions from the rhombohedral $R\bar{3}m$ metric allowed by symmetry are very small, and the explicit monoclinic splittings of the diffraction peaks have not been experimentally observed. We analyze the magnetic crystallographic models metrically compatible with our experimental data in full detail by using the isotropy subgroup representation approach, including rhombohedral solutions based on the propagation vector star $\left\{ \left[\tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\right],\ \left[-\tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\right],\ \left[\tfrac{1}{2}\ -\tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\right],\ \left[\tfrac{1}{2}\ \tfrac{1}{2}\ -\tfrac{1}{2}\right] \right\}$. Although the full star rhombohedral $R\bar{3}c$ structure can equally well fit our diffraction data for NiO, we conclude that the best solution for the crystal and magnetic structures for NiO and MnO is the 1$k$-monoclinic model with the magnetic space group $C_c2/c$ (BNS 15.90, UNI symbol $C2/c.1'_c[C2/m]$).</description>

      <title>Generic continuum model formalism for moir\'e superlattice systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moir\'e superlattice system provides an excellent platform for exploring various novel quantum phenomena. To theoretically tackle the diverse correlated and topological states emerging from moir\'e superlattices, one usually adopts an effective low-energy continuum model based on which the electron-electron effects are further considered. However, the construction of an accurate continuum model remains a challenging task, particularly for complex moir\'e superlattices such as twisted transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work, we develop a formalism for constructing generic continuum models that are in principle applicable for arbitrary moir\'e superlattices and are extrapolatable to any twist angles. Our key insight is that the microscopic electronic properties are intrinsic properties of the system, which should remain invariant across all twist angles; the lattice relaxations act as external inputs that vary with twist angles and are coupled with the electrons, and the coupling coefficients are characterized by intrinsic parameters. This partition enables a universal description of the angle variation of the continuum model using a single set of model parameters. To extract the model parameters, we design a numerical workflow based on data from first principles density functional theory calculations. We apply this framework to twisted bilayer MoTe$_{2}$, and obtain a single set of model parameters that accurately reproduce first-principles results, including electronic band structures, charge density distributions and Chern numbers, at three different twist angles. Furthermore, the model extrapolates robustly to smaller twist angles. Our work not only provides a more precise understanding of the microscopic properties of moir\'e superlattices, but also lays a foundation for future theoretical studies of low-energy electronic properties in generic moir\'e superlattice systems.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic contribution of itinerant electrons to neutron diffraction in the topological antiferromagnet CeAlGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a neutron diffraction study of the magnetic structure of CeAlGe, a candidate topological semimetal that hosts a non-collinear, multi-$\mathbf{k}$ magnetic phase. By measuring both low- and high-momentum-transfer magnetic Bragg peaks within a single experimental setup, we refine a magnetic structure model based solely on localized Ce moments. This model, which differs from that obtained using only high-$Q$ data, quantitatively reproduces the observed intensities, including the $(000)$ zeroth-order magnetic satellites that are especially sensitive to subtle components of the modulation. While a contribution from itinerant electrons to the zeroth satellite cannot be definitively excluded, our analysis reveals no unambiguous evidence for such effects within experimental uncertainty. The refined magnetic structures exhibit topologically nontrivial winding patterns, derived from the fitted magnetic parameters, that support localized, particle-like spin textures with half-integer topological charges. These features provide a natural microscopic origin for the observed topological Hall effect, establishing CeAlGe as a model system where magnetism and topology are intimately linked.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of moir\'e excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique opportunities in optoelectronics due to their strong light-matter interaction and the formation of dipolar interlayer excitons. Introducing a twist angle or lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moir\'e potential that significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such moir\'e-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully accounting for the moir\'e potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for next-generation moir\'e-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Fluids for Nonlinear Photonics: Evaluation of Temperature Dependence of Second-Order Susceptibilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic fluids are promising materials for tunable nonlinear photonics, with applications ranging from second harmonic generation to sources of entangled photons. However, the few reported values of second-order susceptibilities vary widely depending on the molecular architecture. Here, we systematically measure second-order NLO susceptibilities of five different materials that exhibit the ferroelectric nematic phase, as well as the more recently discovered layered smectic A ferroelectric phase. The materials investigated include archetypal molecular architectures as well as mixtures showing room-temperature ferroelectric phases. The measured values, which range from 0.3 to 20 pm/V, are here reasonably predicted by combining calculations of molecular-level hyperpolarizabilities and a simple nematic potential, highlighting the opportunities of modelling-assisted design for enhanced NLO ferroelectric fluids.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable, non-volatile control of optical anisotropy in ReS2 via ferroelectric gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrically tunable linear dichroism (LD) with non-volatile properties represents a critical yet elusive feature for next-generation integrated photonic elements in practical device architectures. Here, we demonstrate record-breaking, non-volatile control of optical anisotropy in two-dimensional ReS2 via ferroelectric gating with aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). Our ferroelectric field-effect transistors achieve near-unity (~95%) LD tunability of differential reflectance at room temperature--the highest reported for any electrically controlled 2D optical system. Crucially, the programmed optical states exhibit exceptional retention exceeding 12,000 seconds without applied bias, enabling true non-volatile optical memory. Through combined experimental characterization and ab initio calculations, we reveal that ferroelectric polarization switching induces substantial asymmetric charge transfer to ReS2, selectively populating conduction band states and triggering structural distortions that dramatically enhance optical anisotropy in the "up" polarization state while leaving the "down" state unperturbed. This ferroelectric-semiconductor coupling provides a universal platform for voltage-programmable, energy-efficient photonic devices with dynamic polarization control, addressing critical needs in integrated photonics as well as programmable far-field optics and telecommunications infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Predicting Structural Relaxation in Supercooled Small Molecules via Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Microscopic Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of small organic molecules is critical for applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to energy and food preservation. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that combines molecular dynamics simulations and Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the structural relaxation behavior of small organic glass-formers. By using propanol, glucose, fructose, and trehalose as model systems, we estimate the glass transition temperature (Tg) from stepwise cooling simulations and volume-temperature analysis. These computed Tg values are then inserted into the ECNLE theory to calculate temperature-dependent relaxation times and diffusion coefficients. Numerical results agree well with experimental data in prior works. This approach provides a predictive and experimentally-independent route for characterizing glassy dynamics in molecular materials.</description>

Abstract: Generative models for materials, especially inorganic crystals, hold potential to transform the theoretical prediction of novel compounds and structures. Advancement in this field depends critically on robust benchmarks and minimal, information-rich datasets that enable meaningful model evaluation. This paper critically examines common datasets and reported metrics for a crystal structure prediction task$\unicode{x2014}$generating the most likely structures given the chemical composition of a material. We focus on three key issues: First, materials datasets should contain unique crystal structures; for example, we show that the widely-utilized carbon-24 dataset only contains $\approx$40% unique structures. Second, materials datasets should not be split randomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we find to be the case for the perov-5 dataset. Third, benchmarks can mislead if used uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the structural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these oft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions of the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and split by number of atoms $N$, and two containing only identical structures but with different unit cells. We also propose a new split for the perov-5 dataset which ensures polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more sensible standard for benchmarking model performance. Finally, we present METRe and cRMSE, new model evaluation metrics that can correct existing issues with the match rate metric.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarization and diode effect in thermoelectric current through altermagnet-based superconductor heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advent of a new class of magnetic material named as altermagnet (AM), characterized by a combination of momentum-dependent spin-splitting with zero net magnetization, has opened up promising prospects for spintronic applications. We theoretically explore how the altermagnetic spin-splitting affects the thermoelectric quasiparticle current in AM-based superconducting heterostructures. Our setup comprises of a bilayer system where a $d$-wave AM is proximity coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor (SC). We calculate the thermoelectric current carried by the quasiparticles applying a finite thermal bias accross the junction. The behavior of the thermoelectric current with the system's base temperature and chemical potential is very similar to that in traditional SC heterostructures. Remarkably, the dissipative thermoelectric current found in the AM junction is spin-split and thus generates finite spin-polarization in the AM-based junction, which can approach $100\%$ spin-polarization in the strong altermagnetic phase. We further investigate the thermoelectric current in AM-based Josephson junction (JJ) and illustrate how to achieve the diode effect in this AM-based JJ. The efficiency of our proposed thermoelectric diode reaches upto $\sim 80\%$ and changes its sign depending on the strength of the AM, enhancing the potential for spin-calotronics applications.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure characterized by flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena, such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and an augmented tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations indicate that spin-orbit coupling in LK-99 generates multiple Weyl points near the Fermi level, thereby enhancing the Berry curvature distribution by further splitting the bands. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. The nonlinear Hall effect is solely due to the BCD, as the contributions from the Drude weight and quantum metric are zero due to time reversal symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.</description>

Abstract: The increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions necessitates advancements in hydrogen storage technologies. This study investigates the hydrogen adsorption characteristics of graphene and a (8,0) carbon nanotube (CNT) decorated with adatoms of various elements. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the universal interatomic potential 'PreFerred Potential' (PFP) implemented in the Matlantis framework, we explore the hydrogen storage capabilities of these doped carbon structures at 77K. We analyze the adsorption efficiency based on the position of adatoms (top, bridge, and hollow sites) and find that the group II elements, such as calcium and strontium, exhibit significant hydrogen uptake. Additionally, light elements like lithium and sodium demonstrate enhanced gravimetric hydrogen storage due to their low atomic mass. Our findings provide insights into the potential of doped graphene and CNTs for efficient hydrogen storage applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the vibrational and thermal properties of solids are influenced by atomistic structural disorder is of fundamental scientific interest, and paramount to designing materials for next-generation energy technologies. While several studies indicate that structural disorder strongly influences the thermal conductivity, the fundamental physics governing the disorder-conductivity relation remains elusive. Here we show that order-of-magnitude, disorder-induced variations of conductivity in network solids can be predicted from a bond-network entropy, an atomistic structural descriptor that quantifies heterogeneity in the topology of the atomic-bond network. We employ the Wigner formulation of thermal transport to demonstrate the existence of a relation between the bond-network entropy, and observables such as smoothness of the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and macroscopic conductivity. We also show that the smoothing of the VDOS encodes information about the thermal resistance induced by disorder, and can be directly related to phenomenological models for phonon-disorder scattering based on the semiclassical Peierls-Boltzmann equation. Our findings rationalize the conductivity variations of disordered carbon polymorphs ranging from nanoporous electrodes to defective graphite used as a moderator in nuclear reactors.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonon Pairs and Rotational Symmetry Breaking of Charge Density Wave Order in the Kagome Superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity measurements to study the symmetry breaking in the charge-density wave (CDW) phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we discover close phonon pairs near 1.3 THz and 3.1 THz, as well as a new mode at 1.84 THz. The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are observed up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional theory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence of Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold rotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient reflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order. Our results thus indicate broken six-fold rotational symmetry in the charge-density wave state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, along with the absence of nematic fluctuation above T$_{\text{CDW}}$. Meanwhile, the measured coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-\text{x}}$Sn$_\text{x}$ with x = 0.03-0.04 matches with staggered inverse Star-of-David with interlayer $\pi$ phase shift. This CDW structure contrasts with undoped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and explains the evolution from phonon pair to a single mode at 1.3 THz by x = 0.03-0.04 Sn-doping.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid density functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional density functional theory (DFT) and Hubbard-corrected DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of torques from orbital Rashba textures: the case of Co/Al interfaces</title>

Abstract: In the context of orbitronics, the rising of the orbital angular momentum generated at light metal interfaces from orbital textures via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects nowadays represent extraordinary alternatives to the usual heavy-metal spin-based materials. In the light of very recent experimental results [\textcolor{blue}{S. Krishnia \textit{et al.}, Nanoletters 2023, 23, 6785}], starting from state-of-the-art density functional theory simulations, we provide theoretical insights into the emergence of very strong orbital torques at the Co/Al interface location a strong orbital Rashba texture. By using linear response theory, we calculate the exerted orbital torque amplitudes, mainly of field-like intraband character, acting onto the ultrathin Co. Moreover, we show that an insertion of a single atomic plane of Pt between Co and Al is enough to suppress the effect which questions about the anatomy of the torque action clearly behaving differently than in the standard way. This work opens new routes to the engineering of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Amorphous phase-change memory alloy with no resistance drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous structural relaxation is intrinsic to glassy materials due to their metastable nature. For phase-change materials (PCMs), the resultant temporal change in electrical resistance seriously hamper in-memory computing (IMC) applications. Here, we report an ab-initio-calculation-informed design of amorphous PCM composed of robust "molecule-like" motifs with minimal Peierls distortion, depriving the amorphous alloy of structural ingredients that would gradually evolve upon aging to entail resistance drift. We demonstrate amorphous CrTe3 thin films that display practically no resistance drift at any working temperature from -200 to 165 degree C. We achieve multilevel programming of CrTe3 through both step-wise crystallization and step-wise amorphization using a hybrid opto-electronic device at various temperatures. Moreover, the application potential of CrTe3 in neuromorphic computing is testified by its incorporation in a vehicle with automatic path-tracking function. Our work opens a new avenue to achieving IMC-requisite properties via judicious design of the composition and atomic-level structure of disordered PCM alloys.</description>

      <title>Sodium-Decorated P-C3N: A Porous 2D Framework for High-Capacity and Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of reversible hydrogen storage materials has become crucial for enabling carbon-neutral energy systems. Based on this, the present work investigates the hydrogen storage on the sodium-decorated P-C$_3$N (Na@P-C$_3$N), a porous carbon nitride monolayer recently proposed as a stable semiconductor. First-principles calculations reveal that Na atoms preferentially adsorb with an adsorption energy of -4.48~eV, effectively suppressing clusterization effects. Upon decoration, the system becomes metallic, while \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations confirm the thermal stability of Na@P-C$_3$N at 300~K. Hydrogen adsorption on Na@P-C$_3$N occurs through weak physisorption, with energies ranging from -0.18 to -0.28~eV, and desorption temperatures between 231 and 357~K. The system can stably absorb 16 H$_2$ molecules per unit cell, corresponding to a gravimetric storage capacity of 9.88~wt\%, surpassing the U.S. Department of Energy target. These results demonstrate that Na@P-C$_3$N is a promising candidate for lightweight, stable, and reversible hydrogen storage.</description>

      <title>Band-selective Plasmonic Polaron in Thermoelectric Semimetal Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ with ultra-high power factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the electronic structure of the thermoelectric semimetal Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ with a large thermoelectric power factor and giant Peltier conductivity by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The ARPES spectra reveal the coexistence of a sharp hole band with a light electron mass and a broad electron band with a relatively heavy electron mass, which originate from different quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) chains in Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$. Moreover, the electron band around the Brillouin-zone (BZ) boundary shows a replica structure with respect to the energy originating from plasmonic polarons due to electron-plasmon interactions. The different scattering effects and interactions in each atomic chain lead to asymmetric transport lifetimes of carriers: a large Seebeck coefficient can be realized even in a semimetal. Our findings pave the way for exploring the thermoelectric materials in previously overlooked semimetals and provide a new platform for low-temperature thermoelectric physics, which has been challenging with semiconductors.</description>

      <title>PyPAS -- Python package for Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy Doppler Broadening Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doppler Broadening (DB) of annihilation radiation is a well-established technique within Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS), used for probing the electronic structure of materials. The analysis of DB experimental data relies on gamma spectroscopy analysis tools, while depth profiling using variable-energy slow positron beams depends on solving the positron diffusion equation. Traditional Variable Energy Doppler Broadening (VEDB) analysis tools, such as VEPFIT and ROYPROF, often present limitations due to outdated interfaces and lack of integration with comprehensive spectroscopy analysis platforms. Addressing these challenges, an open-source Python package for PAS analysis, PyPAS, is introduced. PyPAS offers functionalities including Coincidence Doppler Broadening (CDB) filtering, two-dimensional CDB analysis with DB and resolution extraction, and computation of lineshape parameters (S and W). Furthermore, it integrates modules for generating thermal positron implantation profiles based on established models, solving positron diffusion equations using finite-difference methods and optimizing diffusion length. This work presents the architecture of the PyPAS package and the validation results and demonstrates the application of the package through case studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently discovered collinear magnetic order with net zero magnetization but exhibits spin-splitting band structure, has attracted much research interest due to the rich fundamental physics and possible applications. In this work, we investigate the opto-magnetic response of $d$-wave altermagnets, focusing on the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect--the induction of static magnetization via linearly polarized light. We find that the direction of the induced magnetization is determined by the N\'eel vector. Moreover, its magnitude exhibits a periodic dependence on the polarization angle of the incident light, a hallmark of the system's symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect provides both a method of manipulating altermagnetic magnetization in altemagnets and a probe of their intrinsic properties.</description>

      <title>Electronic order induced symmetry breaking in lattice dynamics of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the molecular Berry curvature (MBC) framework, we develop an \textit{ab initio} algorithm to capture the quantitative effects of magnetic order on lattice dynamics. Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term that breaks both time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving rise to significant off-$\Gamma$ effects. Our results show the phonon splitting of the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes have distinct origins: the $E_g$ splitting arises from MBC and is captured by our algorithm, while the $E_u$ splitting stems from correlation-sensitive Fano resonance, explaining their asymmetric experimental line shapes. We provide a design strategy and computational pathway for materials with large phonon magnetism and splitting, requiring SOC, electron-phonon coupling, and ideally flat bands at the Fermi level. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal phonon transport.</description>

      <title>Chirality-dependent spin polarization in metals: linear and quadratic responses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spin polarization induced by locally injected electric currents in a metal whose spin--orbit interaction reflects its structural chirality. We reveal both spin polarization in bulk in the linear response and antiparallel spin polarization near the boundary in the quadratic response against electric fields, and reproduce the experimentally observed correlation between the chirality of the metal and the direction of spin polarization. In particular, we elucidate that the sign of the quadratic spin accumulation is opposite to that expected from the bulk spin current. This sign discrepancy originates from the dipole-like charge distribution appearing in the quadratic response. Our method is applicable to a wide range of real materials with various types of spin--orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14915v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content, widely employed in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Injectable, depot-forming hydrogels enable sustained release of therapeutic agents by modulating macromolecular diffusion through dynamic polymer networks. However, achieving reliable control over release kinetics remains a challenge, as the injection process induces shear-mediated disruption of transient crosslinks, leading to an initial burst release that can cause local toxicity and compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy designed to restore network structure post-injection through rapid reformation of dynamic crosslinks, enabling time-dependent regulation of diffusion properties. By tuning viscoelastic parameters, including stress relaxation time and network recovery rate, we reduced the extent of burst release without compromising sustained delivery. Using model protein cargo, we demonstrate in both $in~vitro$ and $in~vivo$ settings that hydrogels with faster crosslink reformation kinetics exhibit significantly lower early-phase release while maintaining long-term delivery comparable to unmodified formulations. These results establish a mechanistic framework for decoupling short- and long-term release behavior, offering a broadly applicable strategy for precise drug delivery in soft tissue environments.</description>

      <title>Finite Spinon Density-of-States in Triangular-Lattice Delafossite TlYbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the rare-earth delafossite compound TlYbSe$_2$ -- extending the search for quantum spin liquids in frustrated triangular lattice magnets. While the DC magnetisation suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several Kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetisation and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a quantum-disordered ground state. We observe a spin glass transition around ~30 mK at zero field, arguably originating from a small fraction of free spins -- with an associated entropy of &lt;3 % of the total $R\ln2$, which is suppressed by an applied field of ~0.02 T. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2-5 K is indicative of short-range spin correlations. Below 350 mK, we observe a robust linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity, accompanied by the complete absence of long-range order at low fields. We propose that a phenomenological theory, based on the interplay between spinons and thermally excited gauge flux excitations, can account for the linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity, and could be widely applicable to similar critical quantum spin liquid candidate materials. The results establish the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe$_2$ as a prime candidate for field-tunable triangular quantum spin liquid behavior and highlight the importance of thermally excited gauge field excitations.</description>

      <title>Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches forming a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomenon is explained by a double-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O and V2Te2O/ZnSe/V2Te2O AMTJs. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables us to define new topological invariants. It results in peculiar topological boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases. We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose possible platforms possessing the subspace property.</description>
