      <title>PepDoRA: A Unified Peptide Language Model via Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptide therapeutics, including macrocycles, peptide inhibitors, and bioactive linear peptides, play a crucial role in therapeutic development due to their unique physicochemical properties. However, predicting these properties remains challenging. While structure-based models primarily focus on local interactions, language models are capable of capturing global therapeutic properties of both modified and linear peptides. Protein language models like ESM-2, though effective for natural peptides, cannot however encode chemical modifications. Conversely, pre-trained chemical language models excel in representing small molecule properties but are not optimized for peptides. To bridge this gap, we introduce PepDoRA, a unified peptide representation model. Leveraging Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), PepDoRA efficiently fine-tunes the ChemBERTa-77M-MLM on a masked language model objective to generate optimized embeddings for downstream property prediction tasks involving both modified and unmodified peptides. By tuning on a diverse and experimentally valid set of 100,000 modified, bioactive, and binding peptides, we show that PepDoRA embeddings capture functional properties of input peptides, enabling the accurate prediction of membrane permeability, non-fouling and hemolysis propensity, and via contrastive learning, target protein-specific binding. Overall, by providing a unified representation for chemically and biologically diverse peptides, PepDoRA serves as a versatile tool for function and activity prediction, facilitating the development of peptide therapeutics across a broad spectrum of applications.</description>

      <title>Joint Design of 5' Untranslated Region and Coding Sequence of mRNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines and therapeutics are emerging as powerful tools against a variety of diseases, including infectious diseases and cancer. The design of mRNA molecules, particularly the untranslated region (UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) is crucial for optimizing translation efficiency and stability. Current design approaches generally focus solely on either the 5' UTR or the CDS, which limits their ability to comprehensively enhance translation efficiency and stability. To address this, we introduce LinearDesign2, an algorithm that enables the co-design of the 5' UTR and CDS. This integrated approach optimizes translation initiation efficiency (TIE), codon adaptation index (CAI), and minimum free energy (MFE) simultaneously. Comparative analyses reveal that sequences designed by LinearDesign2 exhibit significantly higher TIE than those designed by LinearDesign, with only a slight increase in MFE. Further, we validate the accuracy of the computational TIE metric using large-scale parallel translation experimental data. This study highlights the importance of a joint design strategy for the 5' UTR and CDS in optimizing mRNA performance, paving the way for more efficient mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.</description>

      <title>On-Site Precise Screening of SARS-CoV-2 Systems Using a Channel-Wise Attention-Based PLS-1D-CNN Model with Limited Infrared Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20132</link>

Abstract: During the early stages of respiratory virus outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the efficient utilize of limited nasopharyngeal swabs for rapid and accurate screening is crucial for public health. In this study, we present a methodology that integrates attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) with the adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares (airPLS) preprocessing algorithm and a channel-wise attention-based partial least squares one-dimensional convolutional neural network (PLS-1D-CNN) model, enabling accurate screening of infected individuals within 10 minutes. Two cohorts of nasopharyngeal swab samples, comprising 126 and 112 samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant cases, were collected at Beijing You'an Hospital for verification. Given that ATR-FTIR spectra are highly sensitive to variations in experimental conditions, which can affect their quality, we propose a biomolecular importance (BMI) evaluation method to assess signal quality across different conditions, validated by comparing BMI with PLS-GBM and PLS-RF results. For the ATR-FTIR signals in cohort 2, which exhibited a higher BMI, airPLS was utilized for signal preprocessing, followed by the application of the channel-wise attention-based PLS-1D-CNN model for screening. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms recently reported methods in the field of respiratory virus spectrum detection, achieving a recognition screening accuracy of 96.48%, a sensitivity of 96.24%, a specificity of 97.14%, an F1-score of 96.12%, and an AUC of 0.99. It meets the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended criteria for an acceptable product: sensitivity of 95.00% or greater and specificity of 97.00% or greater for testing prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in moderate to high volume scenarios.</description>

      <title>SAFE setup for generative molecular design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SMILES-based molecular generative models have been pivotal in drug design but face challenges in fragment-constrained tasks. To address this, the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) representation was recently introduced as an alternative that streamlines those tasks. In this study, we investigate the optimal setups for training SAFE generative models, focusing on dataset size, data augmentation through randomization, model architecture, and bond disconnection algorithms. We found that larger, more diverse datasets improve performance, with the LLaMA architecture using Rotary Positional Embedding proving most robust. SAFE-based models also consistently outperform SMILES-based approaches in scaffold decoration and linker design, particularly with BRICS decomposition yielding the best results. These insights highlight key factors that significantly impact the efficacy of SAFE-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Blurring Diffusion for Hierarchical Molecular Conformer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can diffusion models process 3D geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner, akin to our multiscale view of the world? In this paper, we address the question by focusing on a fundamental biochemical problem of generating 3D molecular conformers conditioned on molecular graphs in a multiscale manner. Our approach consists of two hierarchical stages: i) generation of coarse-grained fragment-level 3D structure from the molecular graph, and ii) generation of fine atomic details from the coarse-grained approximated structure while allowing the latter to be adjusted simultaneously. For the challenging second stage, which demands preserving coarse-grained information while ensuring SE(3) equivariance, we introduce a novel generative model termed Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), which defines a forward process that moves towards the fragment-level coarse-grained structure by blurring the fine atomic details of conformers, and a reverse process that performs the opposite operation using equivariant networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EBD by geometric and chemical comparison to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models on a benchmark of drug-like molecules. Ablation studies draw insights on the design of EBD by thoroughly analyzing its architecture, which includes the design of the loss function and the data corruption process.

      <description>arXiv:2410.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of protein structures is essential for comprehending their biological functions. While significant progress has been made in predicting static folded structures, modeling protein motions on microsecond to millisecond scales remains challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Protein Transformer with Scattering, Attention, and Positional Embedding (ProtSCAPE), which leverages the geometric scattering transform alongside transformer-based attention mechanisms to capture protein dynamics from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. ProtSCAPE utilizes the multi-scale nature of the geometric scattering transform to extract features from protein structures conceptualized as graphs and integrates these features with dual attention structures that focus on residues and amino acid signals, generating latent representations of protein trajectories. Furthermore, ProtSCAPE incorporates a regression head to enforce temporally coherent latent representations.</description>

      <title>FoldMark: Protecting Protein Generative Models with Watermarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein structure is key to understanding protein function and is essential for progress in bioengineering, drug discovery, and molecular biology. Recently, with the incorporation of generative AI, the power and accuracy of computational protein structure prediction/design have been improved significantly. However, ethical concerns such as copyright protection and harmful content generation (biosecurity) pose challenges to the wide implementation of protein generative models. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to embed watermarks into protein generative models and their outputs for copyright authentication and the tracking of generated structures. As a proof of concept, we propose a two-stage method FoldMark as a generalized watermarking strategy for protein generative models. FoldMark first pretrain watermark encoder and decoder, which can minorly adjust protein structures to embed user-specific information and faithfully recover the information from the encoded structure. In the second step, protein generative models are fine-tuned with watermark Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to preserve generation quality while learning to generate watermarked structures with high recovery rates. Extensive experiments are conducted on open-source protein structure prediction models (e.g., ESMFold and MultiFlow) and de novo structure design models (e.g., FrameDiff and FoldFlow) and we demonstrate that our method is effective across all these generative models. Meanwhile, our watermarking framework only exerts a negligible impact on the original protein structure quality and is robust under potential post-processing and adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of uncertainty estimations for Gaussian process regression based machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have seen significant advances as efficient replacement of expensive quantum chemical calculations. Uncertainty estimations for MLIPs are crucial to quantify the additional model error they introduce and to leverage this information in active learning strategies. MLIPs that are based on Gaussian process regression provide a standard deviation as a possible uncertainty measure. An alternative approach are ensemble-based uncertainties. Although these uncertainty measures have been applied to active learning, it has rarely been studied how they correlate with the error, and it is not always clear whether active learning actually outperforms random sampling strategies. We consider GPR models with Coulomb and SOAP representations as inputs to predict potential energy surfaces and excitation energies of molecules. We evaluate, how the GPR variance and ensemble-based uncertainties relate to the error and whether model performance improves by selecting the most uncertain samples from a fixed configuration space. For the ensemble based uncertainty estimations, we find that they often do not provide any information about the error. For the GPR standard deviation, we find that often predictions with an increasing standard deviation also have an increasing systematical bias, which is not captured by the uncertainty. In these cases, selecting training samples with the highest uncertainty leads to a model with a worse test error compared to random sampling. We conclude that confidence intervals, which are derived from the predictive standard deviation, can be highly overconfident. Selecting samples with high GPR standard deviation leads to a model that overemphasizes the borders of the configuration space represented in the fixed dataset. This may result in worse performance in more densely sampled areas but better generalization for extrapolation tasks.</description>

      <title>TurboHopp: Accelerated Molecule Scaffold Hopping with Consistency Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating the vast chemical space of druggable compounds is a formidable challenge in drug discovery, where generative models are increasingly employed to identify viable candidates. Conditional 3D structure-based drug design (3D-SBDD) models, which take into account complex three-dimensional interactions and molecular geometries, are particularly promising. Scaffold hopping is an efficient strategy that facilitates the identification of similar active compounds by strategically modifying the core structure of molecules, effectively narrowing the wide chemical space and enhancing the discovery of drug-like products. However, the practical application of 3D-SBDD generative models is hampered by their slow processing speeds. To address this bottleneck, we introduce TurboHopp, an accelerated pocket-conditioned 3D scaffold hopping model that merges the strategic effectiveness of traditional scaffold hopping with rapid generation capabilities of consistency models. This synergy not only enhances efficiency but also significantly boosts generation speeds, achieving up to 30 times faster inference speed as well as superior generation quality compared to existing diffusion-based models, establishing TurboHopp as a powerful tool in drug discovery. Supported by faster inference speed, we further optimize our model, using Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Models (RLCM), to output desirable molecules. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TurboHopp across multiple drug discovery scenarios, underscoring its potential in diverse molecular settings.</description>

      <title>Reprogramming Pretrained Target-Specific Diffusion Models for Dual-Target Drug Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual-target therapeutic strategies have become a compelling approach and attracted significant attention due to various benefits, such as their potential in overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy. Considering the tremendous success that deep generative models have achieved in structure-based drug design in recent years, we formulate dual-target drug design as a generative task and curate a novel dataset of potential target pairs based on synergistic drug combinations. We propose to design dual-target drugs with diffusion models that are trained on single-target protein-ligand complex pairs. Specifically, we align two pockets in 3D space with protein-ligand binding priors and build two complex graphs with shared ligand nodes for SE(3)-equivariant composed message passing, based on which we derive a composed drift in both 3D and categorical probability space in the generative process. Our algorithm can well transfer the knowledge gained in single-target pretraining to dual-target scenarios in a zero-shot manner. We also repurpose linker design methods as strong baselines for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with various baselines.</description>

      <title>Contextual Representation Anchor Network to Alleviate Selection Bias in Few-Shot Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20711v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the drug discovery process, the low success rate of drug candidate screening often leads to insufficient labeled data, causing the few-shot learning problem in molecular property prediction. Existing methods for few-shot molecular property prediction overlook the sample selection bias, which arises from non-random sample selection in chemical experiments. This bias in data representativeness leads to suboptimal performance. To overcome this challenge, we present a novel method named contextual representation anchor Network (CRA), where an anchor refers to a cluster center of the representations of molecules and serves as a bridge to transfer enriched contextual knowledge into molecular representations and enhance their expressiveness. CRA introduces a dual-augmentation mechanism that includes context augmentation, which dynamically retrieves analogous unlabeled molecules and captures their task-specific contextual knowledge to enhance the anchors, and anchor augmentation, which leverages the anchors to augment the molecular representations. We evaluate our approach on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, as well as in domain transfer experiments. The results demonstrate that CRA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.60% and 3.28% in AUC and $\Delta$AUC-PR metrics, respectively, and exhibits superior generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>EMOCPD: Efficient Attention-based Models for Computational Protein Design Using Amino Acid Microenvironment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21069v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational protein design (CPD) refers to the use of computational methods to design proteins. Traditional methods relying on energy functions and heuristic algorithms for sequence design are inefficient and do not meet the demands of the big data era in biomolecules, with their accuracy limited by the energy functions and search algorithms. Existing deep learning methods are constrained by the learning capabilities of the networks, failing to extract effective information from sparse protein structures, which limits the accuracy of protein design. To address these shortcomings, we developed an Efficient attention-based Models for Computational Protein Design using amino acid microenvironment (EMOCPD). It aims to predict the category of each amino acid in a protein by analyzing the three-dimensional atomic environment surrounding the amino acids, and optimize the protein based on the predicted high-probability potential amino acid categories. EMOCPD employs a multi-head attention mechanism to focus on important features in the sparse protein microenvironment and utilizes an inverse residual structure to optimize the network architecture. The proposed EMOCPD achieves over 80% accuracy on the training set and 68.33% and 62.32% accuracy on two independent test sets, respectively, surpassing the best comparative methods by over 10%. In protein design, the thermal stability and protein expression of the predicted mutants from EMOCPD show significant improvements compared to the wild type, effectively validating EMOCPD's potential in designing superior proteins. Furthermore, the predictions of EMOCPD are influenced positively, negatively, or have minimal impact based on the content of the 20 amino acids, categorizing amino acids as positive, negative, or neutral. Research findings indicate that EMOCPD is more suitable for designing proteins with lower contents of negative amino acids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antibody design, a crucial task with significant implications across various disciplines such as therapeutics and biology, presents considerable challenges due to its intricate nature. In this paper, we tackle antigen-specific antibody sequence-structure co-design as an optimization problem towards specific preferences, considering both rationality and functionality. Leveraging a pre-trained conditional diffusion model that jointly models sequences and structures of antibodies with equivariant neural networks, we propose direct energy-based preference optimization to guide the generation of antibodies with both rational structures and considerable binding affinities to given antigens. Our method involves fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion model using a residue-level decomposed energy preference. Additionally, we employ gradient surgery to address conflicts between various types of energy, such as attraction and repulsion. Experiments on RAbD benchmark show that our approach effectively optimizes the energy of generated antibodies and achieves state-of-the-art performance in designing high-quality antibodies with low total energy and high binding affinity simultaneously, demonstrating the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>MSAGPT: Neural Prompting Protein Structure Prediction via MSA Generative Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) plays a pivotal role in unveiling the evolutionary trajectories of protein families. The accuracy of protein structure predictions is often compromised for protein sequences that lack sufficient homologous information to construct high quality MSA. Although various methods have been proposed to generate virtual MSA under these conditions, they fall short in comprehensively capturing the intricate coevolutionary patterns within MSA or require guidance from external oracle models. Here we introduce MSAGPT, a novel approach to prompt protein structure predictions via MSA generative pretraining in the low MSA regime. MSAGPT employs a simple yet effective 2D evolutionary positional encoding scheme to model complex evolutionary patterns. Endowed by this, its flexible 1D MSA decoding framework facilitates zero or few shot learning. Moreover, we demonstrate that leveraging the feedback from AlphaFold2 can further enhance the model capacity via Rejective Fine tuning (RFT) and Reinforcement Learning from AF2 Feedback (RLAF). Extensive experiments confirm the efficacy of MSAGPT in generating faithful virtual MSA to enhance the structure prediction accuracy. The transfer learning capabilities also highlight its great potential for facilitating other protein tasks.</description>

      <title>Aligning Target-Aware Molecule Diffusion Models with Exact Energy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating ligand molecules for specific protein targets, known as structure-based drug design, is a fundamental problem in therapeutics development and biological discovery. Recently, target-aware generative models, especially diffusion models, have shown great promise in modeling protein-ligand interactions and generating candidate drugs. However, existing models primarily focus on learning the chemical distribution of all drug candidates, which lacks effective steerability on the chemical quality of model generations. In this paper, we propose a novel and general alignment framework to align pretrained target diffusion models with preferred functional properties, named AliDiff. AliDiff shifts the target-conditioned chemical distribution towards regions with higher binding affinity and structural rationality, specified by user-defined reward functions, via the preference optimization approach. To avoid the overfitting problem in common preference optimization objectives, we further develop an improved Exact Energy Preference Optimization method to yield an exact and efficient alignment of the diffusion models, and provide the closed-form expression for the converged distribution. Empirical studies on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that AliDiff can generate molecules with state-of-the-art binding energies with up to -7.07 Avg. Vina Score, while maintaining strong molecular properties. Code is available at https://github.com/MinkaiXu/AliDiff.</description>

      <title>Decomposed Direct Preference Optimization for Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved promising results for Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD). Nevertheless, high-quality protein subpocket and ligand data are relatively scarce, which hinders the models' generation capabilities. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a pivotal tool for aligning generative models with human preferences. In this paper, we propose DecompDPO, a structure-based optimization method aligns diffusion models with pharmaceutical needs using multi-granularity preference pairs. DecompDPO introduces decomposition into the optimization objectives and obtains preference pairs at the molecule or decomposed substructure level based on each objective's decomposability. Additionally, DecompDPO introduces a physics-informed energy term to ensure reasonable molecular conformations in the optimization results. Notably, DecompDPO can be effectively used for two main purposes: (1) fine-tuning pretrained diffusion models for molecule generation across various protein families, and (2) molecular optimization given a specific protein subpocket after generation. Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that DecompDPO significantly improves model performance, achieving up to 95.2% Med. High Affinity and a 36.2% success rate for molecule generation, and 100% Med. High Affinity and a 52.1% success rate for molecular optimization.</description>
