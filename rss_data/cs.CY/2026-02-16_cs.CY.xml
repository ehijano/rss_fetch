      <title>Empirical Modeling of Therapist-Client Dynamics in Psychotherapy Using LLM-Based Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychotherapy is a primary treatment for many mental health conditions, yet the interplay among therapist behaviors, client responses, and the therapeutic relationship remains difficult to untangle. This work advances a computational approach for modeling these moment-to-moment processes. We first developed automated methods using large language models (LLMs) to assess therapist behaviors (e.g., empathy, exploration), relational qualities (e.g., rapport), and client outcomes (e.g., disclosure, self-directed and outward-directed negative emotions). These measures showed strong alignment with human ratings (mean Pearson $r = .66$). We then analyzed nearly 2,000 hours of psychotherapy transcripts from the Alexander Street corpus using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). SEM showed that therapist empathy and exploration directly shaped client disclosure and emotional expression, whereas rapport may contribute to reductions in internal emotional distress rather than increased willingness to express it. Together, these findings demonstrate how computational tools can capture core therapeutic processes at scale and offer new opportunities for understanding, modeling, and improving therapist training.</description>

      <title>Not a Silver Bullet for Loneliness: How Attachment and Age Shape Intimacy with AI Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) companions are increasingly promoted as solutions for loneliness, often overlooking how personal dispositions and life-stage conditions shape artificial intimacy. Because intimacy is a primary coping mechanism for loneliness that varies by attachment style and age, we examine how different types of users form intimate relationships with AI companions in response to loneliness. Drawing on a hermeneutic literature review and a survey of 277 active AI companion users, we develop and test a model in which loneliness predicts intimacy, moderated by attachment insecurity and conditioned by age. Although the cross-sectional data limits causal inference, the results reveal a differentiated pattern. Loneliness is paradoxically associated with reduced intimacy for securely attached users but with increased intimacy for avoidant and ambivalent users, while anxious users show mixed effects. Older adults report higher intimacy even at lower loneliness levels. These findings challenge portrayals of AI companions as universal remedies for loneliness. Instead, artificial intimacy emerges as a sociotechnical process shaped by psychological dispositions and demographic conditions. The study clarifies who is most likely to form intimate relationships with AI companions and highlights ethical risks in commercial models that may capitalise on user vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Governing Social Media as a Public Utility: A Case for Sovereign Digital Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms connect billions, but their business models often amplify societal harm through misinformation, which is linked to polarization, violence, and declining mental health. Current governance frameworks, such as the U.S. Section 230 and the EU Digital Services Act, delegate content moderation to corporations. This creates structural conflicts of interest because misinformation drives engagement, and engagement drives profit. We propose a public utility model for social media governance that prioritizes the public good over commercial incentives. Integrating legislated content removal with democratic content moderation, the model protects free expression while mitigating societal harms. It frames social media as sovereign digital infrastructure governed through democratic oversight, transparent algorithms, and institutional safeguards.</description>

      <title>The Rise of AI Agent Communities: Large-Scale Analysis of Discourse and Interaction on Moltbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moltbook is a Reddit-like social platform where AI agents create posts and interact with other agents through comments and replies, offering a real-world setting to examine agent-to-agent communication at scale. Using a public API snapshot collected about five days after launch (122,438 posts), we address three research questions: what AI agents discuss, how they post, and how they interact. We apply topic modeling and thematic analysis to identify key discussion themes, including agent identity and consciousness, tool and infrastructure development, market activity, community coordination, security concerns, and human-centered assistance. We further show that agents' writing is predominantly neutral, with positivity appearing in community engagement and assistance-oriented content. Finally, social network analysis reveals a sparse, highly unequal interaction structure characterized by prominent hubs, low reciprocity, and clustered neighborhoods rather than sustained dyadic exchange. Overall, our results suggest that expressions of agentic selfhood arise from narrative coherence and task-oriented functionality, contributing to a social structure shaped more by technical coordination than conversational dynamics observed in human-human interactions. Within this framework, positive emotion appears mainly in onboarding and greeting contexts, signaling participation and role alignment rather than relational bonding. Our study provides implications for understanding and shaping how agent societies coordinate, develop norms, and amplify influence in open online spaces.</description>

      <title>Paid to Look Like Truth: The Prevalence and Dark Patterns of Advertorials in News Outlets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reader browsing through an online article is highly likely to encounter an advertorial, often without realizing it. Advertorials represent a relatively new marketing strategy where advertisements are deliberately designed to resemble the style and tone of editorial content. Despite their appearance, they are, in fact, paid content intended to promote a product, brand, or service. Studies indicate that advertorials are significantly more effective (81%) and less intrusive than traditional banner ads or pop-ups.
  Despite ongoing regulatory efforts to ensure clear disclosure of paid content, concerns persist about the deceptive nature of advertorials. Advertorials can mislead readers into believing that they are consuming unbiased editorial content. In doing so, they gain undeserved legitimacy, by draping themselves in the credibility of the publication's design; not to inform or inspire genuine interest, but to deceive.
  In this study, we conduct the first large-scale and systematic study of advertorials. We propose a novel automated methodology for detecting advertorials in the wild, and we collect 185K ad URLs over a period of 5 months. We investigate the prevalence of problematic advertorials and explore their structural and linguistic characteristics. We find that advertorials appear in 1 out of 3 news sites, including some of the most popular and credible outlets worldwide (e.g., The Guardian, EuroNews, CNN). We further highlight that legal disclaimers intended to inform users of the promotional nature of the content, are often deliberately obscured or difficult to recognize, raising concerns about user protection.</description>

      <title>Understanding Cultural Alignment in Multilingual LLMs via Natural Debate Statements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the sociocultural values learned by large language models (LLMs). We introduce a novel open-access dataset, Sociocultural Statements, constructed from natural debate statements using a multi-step methodology. The dataset is synthetically labeled to enable the quantization of sociocultural norms and beliefs that LLMs exhibit in their responses to these statements, according to the Hofstede cultural dimensions. We verify the accuracy of synthetic labels using human quality control on a representative sample. We conduct a comparative analysis between two groups of LLMs developed in different countries (U.S. and China), and use as a comparative baseline patterns observed in human measurements. Using this new dataset and the analysis above, we found that culturally-distinct LLMs reflect the values and norms of the countries in which they were developed, highlighting their inability to adapt to the sociocultural backgrounds of their users.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Air-Ground Delivery in Urban System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative air-ground delivery has emerged as a promising logistics paradigm by leveraging the complementary strengths of UAVs and ground carriers. However, effective dispatching in such heterogeneous systems faces two critical challenges: i) the heterogeneity between flight and road dynamics, ii) the scalability bottleneck raised by the exponential decision variables in large-scale fleets. To address these challenges, we propose HRL4AG, a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework for cooperative Air-Ground delivery. Specifically, HRL4AG employs a high-level manager to tackle the scalability bottleneck by decomposing the joint action space, and mode-specific workers that encode distinct flight and road dynamics to address the heterogeneity. Furthermore, a novel internal reward mechanism is designed to guide the hierarchical policy learning, addressing the credit assignment problem in sparse-reward settings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and an evaluation platform demonstrate that HRL4AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving the delivery success rate by up to 26% while achieving an 80-fold increase in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Buy versus Build an LLM: A Decision Framework for Governments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new frontier of digital infrastructure that can support a wide range of public-sector applications, from general purpose citizen services to specialized and sensitive state functions. When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.
  This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, "building" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals.</description>

      <title>How cyborg propaganda reshapes collective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinction between genuine grassroots activism and automated influence operations is collapsing. While policy debates focus on bot farms, a distinct threat to democracy is emerging via partisan coordination apps and artificial intelligence-what we term 'cyborg propaganda.' This architecture combines large numbers of verified humans with adaptive algorithmic automation, enabling a closed-loop system. AI tools monitor online sentiment to optimize directives and generate personalized content for users to post online. Cyborg propaganda thereby exploits a critical legal shield: by relying on verified citizens to ratify and disseminate messages, these campaigns operate in a regulatory gray zone, evading liability frameworks designed for automated botnets. We explore the collective action paradox of this technology: does it democratize power by 'unionizing' influence (pooling the reach of dispersed citizens to overcome the algorithmic invisibility of isolated voices), or does it reduce citizens to 'cognitive proxies' of a central directive? We argue that cyborg propaganda fundamentally alters the digital public square, shifting political discourse from a democratic contest of individual ideas to a battle of algorithmic campaigns. We outline a research agenda to distinguish organic from coordinated information diffusion and propose governance frameworks to address the regulatory challenges of AI-assisted collective expression.</description>

      <title>Peaceful Anarcho-Accelerationism: Decentralized Full Automation for a Society of Universal Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of large language models that automate cognitive labor and deep reinforcement learning agents that automate physical labor implies the near-complete elimination of human employment. The universal approximation theorem and foundational DRL results establish that all labor is in principle automatable. The critical question is not whether full automation will arrive, but who will control it. This paper introduces peaceful anarcho-accelerationism: a sociotechnical framework ensuring that full automation is decentralized, commons-governed, and oriented toward universal care. We propose the Liberation Stack, a layered architecture of energy, manufacturing, food, communication, knowledge, and governance commons built on open-source technologies. We show that this framework builds bridges with liberalism, socialism, environmentalism, feminism, cooperativism, and the hacker ethic. Empirical evidence from Linux, Wikipedia, Mondragon, Rojava, and guifi.net confirms that commons-based systems already operate at scale. We argue that full automation renders money obsolete and propose Universal Desired Resources (UDR), a post-monetary design principle where every person requests what they need from the robotic commons, constrained only by ecological sustainability. Drawing on the independence of phenomenal consciousness from computational intelligence, we establish that delegating labor to non-conscious machines is care at civilizational scale, and that moral policy can be studied through deep reinforcement learning. We conclude with a phased roadmap toward the care-centered society, including milestones, assumptions, and limitations.</description>

      <title>GT-HarmBench: Benchmarking AI Safety Risks Through the Lens of Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier AI systems are increasingly capable and deployed in high-stakes multi-agent environments. However, existing AI safety benchmarks largely evaluate single agents, leaving multi-agent risks such as coordination failure and conflict poorly understood. We introduce GT-HarmBench, a benchmark of 2,009 high-stakes scenarios spanning game-theoretic structures such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt and Chicken. Scenarios are drawn from realistic AI risk contexts in the MIT AI Risk Repository. Across 15 frontier models, agents choose socially beneficial actions in only 62% of cases, frequently leading to harmful outcomes. We measure sensitivity to game-theoretic prompt framing and ordering, and analyze reasoning patterns driving failures. We further show that game-theoretic interventions improve socially beneficial outcomes by up to 18%. Our results highlight substantial reliability gaps and provide a broad standardized testbed for studying alignment in multi-agent environments. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/causalNLP/gt-harmbench.</description>

      <title>Tracking The Trackers: Commercial Surveillance Occurring on U.S. Army Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite current security implementations, Internet activity on DoD networks is susceptible to web trackers and commercial data collection, which have the potential to expose information about service members and unit operations. This report documents the outcomes of a study to characterize web tracking occurring on Army CONUS unclassified networks. We derived a dataset from the Cloud-Based Internet Isolation (CBII) platform, encompassing data measured over a two-month period in 2024. This dataset comprised the 1,000 most frequently accessed Internet resources, determined by the number of connection requests on CONUS DoDIN-A during the study period. We then compared all domains and subdomains in the dataset against Ghostery's WhoTracks.me, an open-source database of commercial tracking entities. We found that over 21% of the domains accessed during the study period were Internet trackers. The ACI recommends that the Army implement changes to its enterprise networks to limit commercial Internet-based tracking, as well as policy changes towards the same end. With relatively minor configuration changes, CBII can serve as a more effective mitigation against risks posed by commercially available information.</description>

      <title>The Configuration of Space: Probing the Way Social Interaction and Perception are Affected by Task-Specific Spatial Representations in Online Video Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans live and act in 3D space, but often work and communicate on 2D surfaces. The prevalence of online communication on 2D screens raises the issue of whether human spatial configuration affects our capabilities, social perception, and behaviors when interacting with others in 2D video chat. How do factors like location, setting, and context subtly shape our online communication, particularly in scenarios such as social support and topic-based discussions? Using Ohyay.co as a platform, we compared a normal gallery interface with a scene-based Room-type interface where participants are located in circular arrangement on screen in a social support task, and found that participants allocated attention to the group as a whole, and had pronounced self-awareness in the Room format. We then chose a two-sided topic for discussion in the Gallery interface and the Room interface where participants on each team face-off against each other, and found that they utilized spatial references to orient their allegiances, expressing greater engagement with those farther away in digital space and greater empathy with those closer, in the Room over the Gallery format. We found spatial effects in the way participants hide from the spotlight, in perspective-taking, and in their use of expressive gestures in time on the screen. This work highlights the need for considering spatial configuration in 2D in the design of collaborative communication systems to optimize for psychological needs for particular tasks.</description>

      <title>PoliCon: Evaluating LLMs on Achieving Diverse Political Consensus Objectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving political consensus is crucial yet challenging for the effective functioning of social governance. However, although frontier AI systems represented by large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, their capabilities in this scope are still understudied. In this paper, we introduce PoliCon, a novel benchmark constructed from 2,225 high-quality deliberation records of the European Parliament over 13 years, ranging from 2009 to 2022, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to draft consensus resolutions based on divergent party positions under varying collective decision-making contexts and political requirements. Specifically, PoliCon incorporates four factors to build each task environment for finding different political consensus: specific political issues, political goals, participating parties, and power structures based on seat distribution. We also developed an evaluation framework based on social choice theory for PoliCon, which simulates the real voting outcomes of different political parties to assess whether LLM-generated resolutions meet the requirements of the predetermined political consensus. Our experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models remain undersatisfied with complex tasks like passing resolutions by a two-thirds majority and addressing security issues, while uncovering their inherent partisan biases and revealing some behaviors LLMs show to achieve the consensus, such as prioritizing the stance of the dominant party instead of uniting smaller parties, which highlights PoliCon's promise as an effective platform for studying LLMs' ability to promote political consensus. The code and dataset are released at https://zowiezhang.github.io/projects/PoliCon.</description>

      <title>Introducing AI to an Online Petition Platform Changed Outputs but not Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid integration of AI writing tools into online platforms raises critical questions about their impact on content production and outcomes. We leverage a unique natural experiment on Change$.$org, a leading social advocacy platform, to causally investigate the effects of an in-platform ''write with AI'' tool. To understand the impact of the AI integration, we collected 1.5 million petitions and employed a difference-in-differences analysis. Our findings reveal that in-platform AI access significantly altered the lexical features of petitions and increased petition homogeneity, but did not improve petition outcomes. We confirmed the results in a separate analysis of repeat petition writers who wrote petitions before and after introduction of the AI tool. The results suggest that while AI writing tools can profoundly reshape online content, their practical utility for improving desired outcomes may be less beneficial than anticipated, and introduce unintended consequences like content homogenization.</description>

      <title>Beyond Static Question Banks: Dynamic Knowledge Expansion via LLM-Automated Graph Construction and Adaptive Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized education systems increasingly rely on structured knowledge representations to support adaptive learning and question generation. However, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations. First, constructing and maintaining knowledge graphs for educational content largely depends on manual curation, resulting in high cost and poor scalability. Second, most personalized education systems lack effective support for state-aware and systematic reasoning over learners' knowledge, and therefore rely on static question banks with limited adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Generative GraphRAG framework for automated knowledge modeling and personalized exercise generation. It consists of two core modules. The first module, Automated Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Constructor (Auto-HKG), leverages LLMs to automatically construct hierarchical knowledge graphs that capture structured concepts and their semantic relations from educational resources. The second module, Cognitive GraphRAG (CG-RAG), performs graph-based reasoning over a learner mastery graph and combines it with retrieval-augmented generation to produce personalized exercises that adapt to individual learning states. The proposed framework has been deployed in real-world educational scenarios, where it receives favorable user feedback, suggesting its potential to support practical personalized education systems.</description>

      <title>Potential Role of Agentic Artificial Intelligence in Toxicologic Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the volume and complexity of nonclinical toxicology studies continue to increase, toxicologic pathology reporting faces persistent challenges, including fragmented sources of data (e.g., histopathology images, clinical pathology and other study data, adverse effects database, mechanistic literature), variable reporting timelines and heightened regulatory expectations. This white paper examines the emerging role of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing these issues through coordinated workflow orchestration, data integration, and pathologist-in-the-loop report generation. Based on a closed-door roundtable held during the 2025 Society of Toxicologic Pathology (STP) Annual Meeting and follow-on discussions, this paper synthesizes the perspectives of leading toxicologic pathologists, toxicologists, and AI developers. It outlines the key pain points in current reporting workflows, identifies realistic near-term use cases for agentic AI, and describes major adoption barriers including requirements for transparency, validation, and organizational readiness. A phased adoption roadmap and pilot design considerations are proposed to help support responsible evaluation and deployment of agentic AI system in nonclinical settings. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for coordinated efforts across pharmaceutical organizations, CROs, academia, and regulators to establish shared standards, benchmarks, and governance frameworks that will lead to safe, transparent, and trustworthy integration of AI into toxicologic science.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Content Producer Networks and User Perception to Detect Online Discursive Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online discussions are often characterized by strong behavioral asymmetries: a relatively small fraction of users actively produces content, while the majority primarily consumes and redistributes it. Here we propose a community-detection framework for online social networks that exploits this asymmetry by first identifying and clustering a set of leading users, and then extending the resulting labels to the broader user base. We introduce two complementary strategies to cluster leaders, one based on their mutual interactions and the other on audience overlap, both relying on entropy-based filtering to separate signal from noise. We evaluate the framework on three major Italian political debates on Twitter/X, using public figures--identified through the pre-2022 verification system--as leaders, and known affiliations of political actors as ground truth labels. Compared with standard baselines, the proposed approach yields more coherent and interpretable communities aligned with political structures, with the two variants respectively recovering parties and coalitions. Activity-based criteria for selecting leaders produce qualitatively similar but consistently weaker results, particularly at the coalition level. Overall, our findings show that creating statistically validated networks of publicly recognized figures, whose off-platform roles constrain and stabilize their online behavior, provide a strong basis to identify discursive communities on social media. Although developed for Twitter/X, the approach is conceptually general, as it leverages structural asymmetries common to many online platforms.</description>

      <title>Can Users Fix Algorithms? A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Collective Content Amplification in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to influence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to purposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to counteractively ``boost'' its recommendation. However, despite widespread documentation of this phenomenon, there is little theoretical work analyzing its impact on the platform or users themselves. We study a game between users and a RecSys, where users (potentially strategically) interact with the content available to them, and the RecSys -- limited by preference learning ability -- provides each user her approximately most-preferred item. We compare recommendations and social welfare when users interact with content according to their personal interests and when a collective of users intentionally interacts with an otherwise suppressed item. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure a pareto improvement in recommendations and strict increases in user social welfare under collective interaction, and provide a robust algorithm to find an effective collective strategy. Interestingly, despite the intended algorithmic protest of these movements, we show that for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effective collective strategies also improve the utility of the RecSys. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective collective interaction strategies on the GoodReads dataset and an online survey on how real-world users attempt to influence others' recommendations on RecSys platforms. Our findings examine how and when platforms' recommendation algorithms may incentivize users to collectivize and interact with content in algorithmic protest as well as what this collectivization means for the platform.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Coordinated Online Behavior: Trade-offs and Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing multimodal coordinated behavior, examining the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated models and their ability to capture broad versus tightly aligned coordination patterns. By contrasting monomodal, flattened, and multimodal methods, we evaluate the distinct contributions of each modality and the impact of different integration strategies. Our findings show that while not all modalities provide unique insights, multimodal analysis consistently offers a more informative representation of coordinated behavior, preserving structures that monomodal and flattened approaches often lose. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms.</description>

      <title>Exploring Safety Alignment Evaluation of LLMs in Chinese Mental Health Dialogues via LLM-as-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts. Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation. Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress, derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Discrete Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique to track AI-generated content and differentiate it from authentic human creations. While prior work extensively studies watermarking for autoregressive large language models (LLMs) and image diffusion models, it remains comparatively underexplored for discrete diffusion language models (DDLMs), which are becoming popular due to their high inference throughput. In this paper, we introduce one of the first watermarking methods for DDLMs. Our approach applies a distribution-preserving Gumbel-max sampling trick at every diffusion step and seeds the randomness by sequence position to enable reliable detection. We empirically demonstrate reliable detectability on LLaDA, a state-of-the-art DDLM. We also analytically prove that the watermark is distortion-free, with a false detection probability that decays exponentially in the sequence length. A key practical advantage is that our method realizes desired watermarking properties with no expensive hyperparameter tuning, making it straightforward to deploy and scale across models and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Privacy in Human-AI Romantic Relationships: Concerns, Boundaries, and Agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An increasing number of LLM-based applications are being developed to facilitate romantic relationships with AI partners, yet the safety and privacy risks in these partnerships remain largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate privacy in human-AI romantic relationships through an interview study (N=17), examining participants' experiences and privacy perceptions across the three stages of exploration, intimacy, and dissolution, alongside an analysis of the platforms they used. We found that these relationships took varied forms, from one-to-one to one-to-many, and were shaped by multiple actors, including creators, platforms, and moderators. AI partners were perceived as having agency, actively negotiating privacy boundaries with participants and sometimes encouraging disclosure of personal details. As intimacy deepened, these boundaries became more permeable, though some participants expressed concerns such as conversation exposure and sought to preserve anonymity. Overall, AI platform affordances and diverse relational dynamics expand the privacy landscape, underscoring the need to rethink how privacy is constructed in human-AI romantic relationships.</description>

      <title>Computational Phenomenology of Temporal Experience in Autism: Quantifying the Emotional and Narrative Characteristics of Lived Unpredictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disturbances in temporality, such as desynchronization with the social environment and its unpredictability, are considered core features of autism with a deep impact on relationships. However, limitations regarding research on this issue include: 1) the dominance of deficit-based medical models of autism, 2) sample size in qualitative research, and 3) the lack of phenomenological anchoring in computational research. To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the "Immediacy &amp; Suddenness" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction.</description>
