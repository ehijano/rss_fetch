      <title>Current fluctuations of a self-interacting diffusion on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15561v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations in the average speed or current of a self-interacting diffusion (SID) on a ring, mimicking the non-Markovian behaviour of an agent influenced by its own path. We derive the SID's phase diagram, showing a delocalisation-localisation phase transition from self-repelling to self-attracting. Current fluctuations are analysed using: (i) an adiabatic approximation, where the system reaches its stationary distribution before developing current fluctuations, and (ii) an original extension of level 2.5 large deviations for Markov processes. The latter, combined with perturbation theory, provides an upper bound to current fluctuations, which is tight in the self-repelling region, while the former approximates current fluctuations well in all regimes. Both methods accurately estimate the asymptotic variance and suggests a phase transition at the onset of the localised regime.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Histories: Chaotic Versus Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study of frustrated Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions in generalized triangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model with nearest-neighbor interaction $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ in two kinds of generalized triangular lattices (GTLs) employing the Wang--Landau Monte Carlo method and finite-size scaling analysis. In the first GTL (GTL1), featuring anisotropic properties, we identify three kinds of super-antiferromagnetic ground states with stripe structures. Meanwhile, in the second GTL (GTL2), which is non-regular in next-nearest-neighbor interaction, the ferrimagnetic 3$\times$3 and two kinds of partial spin liquid ground states are observed. We confirm that residual entropy is proportional to the number of spins in the partial spin liquid ground states. Additionally, we construct finite-temperature phase diagrams for ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. In GTL1, the transition into the ferromagnetic phase is continuous, contrasting with the first-order transition into the stripe phase. In GTL2, the critical temperature into the ferromagnetic ground state decreases as antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interaction intensifies until it meets the 3$\times$3 phase boundary. For intermediate values of the next-nearest-neighbor interaction, two successive transitions emerge: one from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase, followed by the other transition from the ferromagnetic phase to the 3$\times$3 phase.</description>

      <title>On the `mosaic' picture of liquids and glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercooled liquids are sometimes described as being composed of a mosaic of patches that may be listed in a `library', each one having some form of non-periodic order. Looking closer, one finds this construction elusive. In attempting to give the notion of mosaic a precise sense, we find that we are inevitably led to the construction of a procedure for compressing the information in the particle configuration, essentially the same as that used for texts. The amount of optimally stored information directly defines the configurational entropy. A solid, in this view, is a particle arrangement described by a low amount of information, that can only flow by breaking into uncorrelated pieces, thus increasing its complexity.</description>

      <title>Discrete spacetime crystal: Intertwined spacetime symmetry breaking in a driven-dissipative spin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium driving systems provide fertile ground for exploring intriguing spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomena. In this study, we report on the intertwined discrete spacetime translational symmetry breaking in a driven-dissipative spin system without pure spatial translational symmetry, resulting in the emergence of an out-of-equilibrium nonmagnetic phase termed the "discrete spacetime crystal." In contrast to the previously widely studied discrete time crystal, the spins establish a distinctive long-range crystalline order not only in time, but also in the intertwined spacetime direction. We further demonstrate the exponentially-long lifetime of the spatial-temporal order against generic weak environmental noise fluctuations. Finally, possible experimental realizations of our model are discussed. Our findings shed light on the existence of exotic phases of matter characterized by intertwined space-time symmetry breaking, paving the way for future investigations into the properties and potential applications of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Noise in V-Shape Linear Well Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium noise is characterized as noise realizations where external agitations disrupt the harmonic equilibrium of Brownian motion. Excitations in a particle's random walk into a so-called L\'evy flight changes the distribution of the noise from Gaussian to the fat-tailed L\'evy distribution. Generalization between Gaussian and L\'evy distributions is the $\alpha$-stability distribution, where $1&lt;\alpha\leq2$. In this study, the $\alpha$-stability distributed noise is subjugated into the Langevin and fractional Fokker--Planck equations that correspond to a V-shaped linear potential well $V(x)=F|x|$. From these equations, an Euler scheme for computational simulation via iterations is presented, and a probability density function that is normalizable under any $\alpha\in(1,2]$ is obtained. This study is focused more on the theoretical framework of non-equilibrium noise in V-shaped linear well profiles, which is intended to be applied to systems known to exhibit self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Apparent phase transitions and critical-like behavior in multi-component mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation has recently emerged as an important topic in the context of cellular organization. Within this context, there are multiple poorly understood features; for instance hints of critical behavior in the plasma membrane, and how homeostasis maintains phase separation. In this paper, using statistical mechanics, we show that finite size effects in multicomponent mixtures can induce the system to behave as-if it were near a critical point, which we term apparent transitions. The apparent transition temperature is naturally driven towards the ambient temperature of the system.</description>

      <title>Biologically relevant finite-size effects in a driven lattice gas with particle pausing and dynamical defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we present a comprehensive study of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with pausing particles (pTASEP), a model initially introduced to describe RNAP dynamics during transcription. We extend previous mean-field approaches and demonstrate that the pTASEP is equivalent to the exclusion process with dynamical defects (ddTASEP), thus broadening the scope of our investigation to a larger class of problems related to transcription and translation. We extend the mean-field theory to the open boundary case, revealing the system's phase diagram and critical values of entry and exit rates. However, we identify a significant discrepancy between theory and simulations in a region of the parameter space, indicating severe finite-size effects. To address this, we develop a single-cluster approximation that captures the relationship between current and lattice size, providing a more accurate representation of the system's dynamics. Finally, we extend our approach to open boundary conditions, demonstrating its applicability in different scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of considering finite-size effects, often overlooked in the literature, when modelling biological processes such as transcription and translation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamically consistent many-body Harada-Sasa relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of particles -- arising from the conservation of momentum in the fluid medium -- is examined in the context of the relationship between fluctuations, response functions, and the entropy production rate. The multiplicative nature of the hydrodynamic interactions is shown to introduce subtleties that preclude a straightforward extension of the Harada-Sasa relation. A generalization of the definitions involved in the framework is used to propose a new form of the relation applicable to systems with hydrodynamic interactions. The resulting framework will enable characterization of the non-equilibrium properties of living and active matter systems, which are predominantly in suspensions.</description>

      <title>Entropy as Noether charge for quasistatic gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy increase is fundamentally related to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. By adding the 'extra dimension' associated with thermodynamic forces, we extend that discrete symmetry to a continuous symmetry for the dynamical fluctuations around (nonlinear) gradient flow. The latter connects macroscopic equilibrium conditions upon introducing a quasistatic protocol of control parameters. The entropy state function becomes the Noether charge. As a result, and following ideas expressed by Shin-ichi Sasa and co-workers, the adiabatic invariance of the entropy, part of the Clausius heat theorem, gets connected with the Noether theorem.</description>

      <title>Rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterised by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In a well-mixed population, this exponential increase is controlled by the basic reproduction number R0 and the distribution of times between consecutive infection along an infection chain. However, real populations are characterised by a complex network of interactions, and are thus far from being well mixed. Here, we derive an expression for the rate of exponential spread of an epidemic on a complex network. We find that this rate is affected by the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. The theory presented in this paper bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex network, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Entropy and Free Energy of Solid Lithium using Covariance of Atomic Displacements Enabled by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational properties of solids are key to determining stability, response and functionality. However, they are challenging to computationally predict at Ab-Initio accuracy, even for elemental systems. Ab-Initio methods for modeling atomic interactions are limited in the system sizes and simulation times that can be achieved. Due to these limitations, Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are gaining popularity and success as a faster, more scalable approach for modeling atomic interactions, potentially at Ab-Initio accuracy. Even with faster potentials, methodologies for predicting entropy, free energy and vibrational properties vary in accuracy, cost and difficulty to implement. Using the Covariance of Atomic Displacements (CAD) to predict entropy, free energy and finite-temperature phonon dispersions is a promising approach but thorough benchmarking has been hampered by the cost of Ab-Initio methods for sampling. In this work, we use a MLIP and the CAD to characterize the convergence of the predicted properties and determine optimal sampling strategies. We focus on solid lithium at zero pressure, showing that the MLIP-CAD approach reproduces experimental entropy, phonon dispersions and the martensitic transition while also comparing to more established methods.</description>

      <title>Perturbative stability and error correction thresholds of quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically-ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general CSS codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the discretized imaginary time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the LDPC condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence to stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and time-like defects in the lattice gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of space-like defects corresponds to a successful "memory experiment" and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of time-like defects corresponds to a successful "stability experiment" and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven decision-making dynamics sheds light on the emergence of the "paradox of choice"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision making is the cognitive process of selecting a course of action among multiple alternatives. As the decision maker belongs to a complex microenvironment (which contains multiple decision makers), has to make a decision where multiple options are present which often leads to a phenomenon known as the "paradox of choices". The latter refers to the case where too many options can lead to negative outcomes, such as increased uncertainty, decision paralysis, and frustration. Here, we employ an entropy driven mechanism within a statistical physics framework to explain the premises of the paradox. In turn, we focus on the emergence of a collective "paradox of choice", in the case of interacting decision-making agents, quantified as the decision synchronization time. Our findings reveal a trade-off between synchronization time and the sensing radius, indicating the optimal conditions for information transfer among group members, which significantly depends the individual sensitivity parameters. Interestingly, when agents sense their microenvironment in a biased way or their decisions are influenced by their past choices, then the collective "paradox of choice" does not occur. In a nutshell, our theory offers a low-dimensional and unified statistical explanation of the "paradox of choice" at the individual and at the collective level.</description>

      <title>Heat conduction in low-dimensional electron gases without and with a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of heat conduction in two-dimensional (2D) electron gases without and with a magnetic field. We perform simulations with the Multi-Particle-Collision approach, suitably adapted to account for the Lorenz force acting on the particles. For zero magnetic field, we find that the heat conductivity $\kappa$ diverges with the system size $L$ following the logarithmic relation $\kappa\thicksim \ln L$ (as predicted for two-dimensional (2D) systems) for small $L$ values; however, in the thermodynamic limit the heat conductivity tends to follow the relation $\kappa\thicksim L^{1/3}$, as predicted for one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This suggests the presence of a dimensional-crossover effect in heat conduction in electronic systems that adhere to standard momentum conservation. Under the magnetic field, time-reversal symmetry is broken and the standard momentum conservation in the system is no longer satisfied but the \emph{pseudomomentum} of the system is still conserved. In contrast with the zero-field case, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations indicate a finite heat conductivity independent on the system size $L$ as $L$ increases. This indicates that pseudomomentum conservation can exhibit normal diffusive heat transport, which differs from the abnormal behavior observed in low-dimensional coupled charged harmonic oscillators with pseudomomentum conservation in a magnetic field. These findings support the validity of the hydrodynamic theory in electron gases and clarify that pseudomomentum conservation is not enough to ensure the anomalous behavior of heat conduction.</description>

      <title>Odd Dipole Screening in Radial Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of ``Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>

      <title>Identification and classification of clusters of dipolar colloids in an external field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloids can acquire a dipolar interaction in the presence of an external electric field. At high field strength, the particles form strings in the field direction. However at weaker field strength, competition with isotropic interactions is expected. One means to investigate this interplay between dipolar and isotropic interactions is to consider clusters of such particles. We have therefore identified, using the GMIN basinhopping tool, a rich library of lowest energy clusters of a dipolar colloidal system where the dipole orientation is fixed with respect to the z-axis, and the dipole strength is varied for m--membered clusters of 7 &lt;= m &lt;=13. In the regime where the isotropic and dipolar interactions are comparable, we find elongated polytetrahedral, octahedral and spiral clusters as well as a set of non--rigid clusters which emerge close to the transition to strings. We further implement a search algorithm which identifies these minimum energy clusters in bulk systems using the topological cluster classification [J. Chem. Phys. 139 234506 (2013)]. We demonstrate this methodology with computer simulations which shows instances of these clusters as a function of dipole strength.</description>

      <title>Learning in Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation, a Neural Mass Network Model, treats different subcortical regions of the brain as connected nodes, with connections representing various types of structural, functional, or effective neuronal connectivity between these regions. Each region comprises interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells, consistent with the standard Wilson-Cowan model. By incorporating stable attractors into such a metapopulation model's dynamics, we transform it into a learning algorithm capable of achieving high image and text classification accuracy. We test it on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, in combination with convolutional neural networks, on CIFAR-10 and TF-FLOWERS, and, in combination with a transformer architecture (BERT), on IMDB, always showing high classification accuracy. These numerical evaluations illustrate that minimal modifications to the Wilson-Cowan model for metapopulation can reveal unique and previously unobserved dynamics.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to overheat ice? The activated melting of TIP4P/Ice at solid-vapor coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A widely accepted phenomenological rule states that solids with free surfaces cannot be overheated. In this work we discuss this statement critically under the light of the statistical thermodynamics of interfacial roughening transitions. Our results show that the basal face of ice as described by the TIP4P/Ice model can remain mechanically stable for more than one hundred nanoseconds when overheated by 1~K, and for several hundreds of nanoseconds at smaller overheating despite the presence of a significant quasi-liquid layer at the surface. Such time scales, which are often of little experimental significance, can become a concern for the determination of melting points by computer simulations using the direct coexistence method. In the light of this observation, we reinterpret computer simulations of ice premelting and show that current results for the TIP4P/Ice model all imply a scenario of incomplete surface melting. Using a thermodynamic integration path, we reassess our own estimates for the Laplace pressure difference between water and vapor. These calculations are used to measure the disjoining pressure of premelting liquid films and allow us to confirm a minimum of the interfacial free energy at finite premelting thickness of about one nanometer.</description>

      <title>Coding schemes in neural networks learning classification tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks posses the crucial ability to generate meaningful representations of task-dependent features. Indeed, with appropriate scaling, supervised learning in neural networks can result in strong, task-dependent feature learning. However, the nature of the emergent representations, which we call the `coding scheme', is still unclear. To understand the emergent coding scheme, we investigate fully-connected, wide neural networks learning classification tasks using the Bayesian framework where learning shapes the posterior distribution of the network weights. Consistent with previous findings, our analysis of the feature learning regime (also known as `non-lazy', `rich', or `mean-field' regime) shows that the networks acquire strong, data-dependent features. Surprisingly, the nature of the internal representations depends crucially on the neuronal nonlinearity. In linear networks, an analog coding scheme of the task emerges. Despite the strong representations, the mean predictor is identical to the lazy case. In nonlinear networks, spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to either redundant or sparse coding schemes. Our findings highlight how network properties such as scaling of weights and neuronal nonlinearity can profoundly influence the emergent representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the preparation of a large quantum register of 5612 qubits, with the unprecedented high global fidelity of $F\simeq 0.9956$. This was achieved by applying an improved cooperative quantum information erasure (CQIE) protocol [Buffoni, L. and Campisi, M., Quantum 7, 961 (2023)] to a programmable network of superconducting qubits featuring a high connectivity. At variance with the standard method based on the individual reset of each qubit in parallel, here the quantum register is treated as a whole, thus avoiding the well-known orthogonality catastrophe wehereby even an extremely high individual reset fidelity $f$ results in vanishing global fidelities $F=f^N$ with growing number $N$ of qubits.</description>

      <title>How to compute efficiently the analytical solution to Heisenberg spin glass models on sparse random graphs and their de Almeida-Thouless line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Results regarding spin glass models are, to this day, mainly confined to models with Ising spins. Spin glass models with continuous spins exhibit interesting new physical behaviors related to the additional degrees of freedom, but have been primarily studied on fully connected topologies. Only recently some advancements have been made in the study of continuous models on sparse graphs. In this work we partially fill this void by introducing a method to solve numerically the Belief Propagation equations for systems of Heisenberg spins on sparse random graphs via a discretization of the sphere. We introduce techniques to study the finite-temperature, finite-connectivity case as well as novel algorithms to deal with the zero-temperature and large connectivity limits. As an application, we locate the de Almeida-Thouless line for this class of models and the critical field at zero temperature, showing the full consistency of the methods presented. Beyond the specific results reported for Heisenberg models, the approaches presented in this paper have a much broader scope of application and pave the way to the solution of strongly disordered models with continuous variables.</description>

Abstract: We study statistical properties of matrix elements of observables written in the energy eigenbasis and truncated to small microcanonical windows. We present numerical evidence indicating that for all few body operators in chaotic many-body systems, truncated below certain energy scale, collective statistical properties of matrix elements exhibit emergent unitary symmetry. Namely, we show that below certain scale the spectra of the truncated operators exhibit universal behavior, matching our analytic predictions, which are numerically testable for system sizes beyond exact diagonalization. We discuss operator and system-size dependence of the energy scale of emergent unitary symmetry and put our findings in context of previous works exploring emergence of random-matrix behavior at small energy scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a novel class of classical integrable many-body systems obtained by generalized $T\bar{T}$-deformations of free particles. Deformation terms are bilinears in densities and currents for the continuum of charges counting asymptotic particles of different momenta. In these models, which we dub ``semiclassical Bethe systems'' for their link with the dynamics of Bethe ansatz wave packets, many-body scattering processes are factorised, and two-body scattering shifts can be set to an almost arbitrary function of momenta. The dynamics is local but inherently different from that of known classical integrable systems. At short scales, the geometry of the deformation is dynamically resolved: either particles are slowed down (more space available), or accelerated via a novel classical particle-pair creation/annihilation process (less space available). The thermodynamics both at finite and infinite volumes is described by the equations of (or akin to) the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, and at large scales generalized hydrodynamics emerge.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the transport behavior of quantum many-body systems constitutes an important physical endeavor, both experimentally and theoretically. While a reliable classification into normal and anomalous dynamics is known to be notoriously difficult for a given microscopic model, even the seemingly simpler evaluation of transport coefficients in diffusive systems continues to be a hard task in practice. This fact has motivated the development and application of various sophisticated methods and is also the main issue of this paper. We particularly take a barely used strategy, which is based Lanczos coefficients, and demonstrate that this strategy allows for the accurate calculation of diffusion coefficients for different paradigmatic examples, including magnetization transport in nonintegrable spin-1/2 chains and ladders as well as energy transport in the mixed-field Ising model in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Entangled multiplets, asymmetry, and quantum Mpemba effect in dissipative systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the entanglement asymmetry emerged as an informative tool to understand dynamical symmetry restoration in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems after a quantum quench. For integrable systems the asymmetry can be understood in the space-time scaling limit via the quasiparticle picture, as it was pointed out in Ref. [1]. However, a quasiparticle picture for quantum quenches from generic initial states was still lacking. Here we conjecture a full-fledged quasiparticle picture for the charged moments of the reduced density matrix, which are the main ingredients to construct the asymmetry. Our formula works for quenches producing entangled multiplets of an arbitrary number of excitations. We benchmark our results in the $XX$ spin chain. First, by using an elementary approach based on the multidimensional stationary phase approximation we provide an $\textit{ab initio}$ rigorous derivation of the dynamics of the charged moments for the quench treated in [2]. Then, we show that the same results can be straightforwardly obtained within our quasiparticle picture. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain a general criterion ensuring a vanishing entanglement asymmetry at long times. Next, by using the Lindblad master equation, we study the effect of gain and loss dissipation on the entanglement asymmetry. Specifically, we investigate the fate of the so-called quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in the presence of dissipation. We show that dissipation can induce QME even if unitary dynamics does not show it, and we provide a quasiparticle-based interpretation of the condition for the QME.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An XXZ spin chain at zero magnetization is subject to spatially correlated baths acting as dissipation. We show that the low-energy excitations of this model are described by a dissipative sine-Gordon field theory, i.e. a sine-Gordon action with an additional long-range interaction emerging from dissipation. The field theory is then exactly mapped onto a generalized Coulomb gas which, in addition to the usual integer charges, displays half-integer charges that originate from the dissipative baths. These new charges come in pairs linked by a charge-independent logarithmic interaction. In the Coulomb gas picture, we identify a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like phase transition corresponding to the binding of charges and derive the associated perturbative renormalization group equations. For superohmic baths, the transition is due to the binding of the integer charges, while for subohmic baths, it is due to the binding of the half-integer charges, thereby signaling a dissipation-induced transition.</description>

Abstract: The Ablowitz-Ladik chain is an integrable discretized version of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We report on a novel underlying Hamiltonian particle system with properties similar to the ones known for the classical Toda chain and Calogero fluid with $1/\sinh^2$ pair interaction. Boundary conditions are imposed such that, both in the distant past and future, particles have a constant velocity. We establish the many-particle scattering for the Ablowitz-Ladik chain and obtain properties known for generic integrable many-body systems. For a specific choice of the chain, real initial data remain real in the course of time. Then, asymptotically, particles move in pairs with a velocity-dependent size and scattering shifts are governed by the fusion rule.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic analog of critical phenomena: an uncountably infinite number of universality classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical phenomena, in which various physical quantities exhibit power laws, have been widely observed in nature and played a central role in physics. They generated the concept of universality class, which origin is elucidated by the renormalization group (RG) theory and which has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, with this version remarkably revealing the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk. The entrained air eventually detaches from the disk with or without breakup involving change in topology. While the time development of the interface shape is self-similar with characteristic length scales exhibiting power laws as in the case of non-confined previous studies, we here found that the observed self-similar shape corresponds to a solution to the governing equations, which we show a stable fixed point of the RG flow by combining a RG analysis and the dynamical system description (DSD) developed for singular dynamics in applied mathematics. We thus demonstrate a striking analogy with critical phenomena, showing critical exponents that define a universality class depend on "continuous numbers" characterizing the confinement. This is in contrast with the conventional critical phenomena, in which a class is defined by "discrete numbers." Our results open a new avenue for our understanding of critical phenomena, RG, and DSD, which impacts on the study of singular dynamics widely observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum thermodynamics described as a system-bath model: The dimensionless minimum work principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a thermodynamic theory applicable to both classical and quantum systems. These systems are depicted as thermodynamic system-bath models capable of handling isothermal, isentropic, thermostatic, and entropic processes. Our approach is based on the use of a dimensionless thermodynamic potential expressed as a function of the intensive and extensive thermodynamic variables. Using the principles of dimensionless minimum work and dimensionless maximum entropy derived from quasi-static changes of external perturbations and temperature, we obtain the Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energy. These potentials can be interconverted through time-dependent Legendre transformations. Our results are verified numerically for an anharmonic Brownian system described in phase space using the low-temperature quantum Fokker-Planck equations in the quantum case and the Kramers equation in the classical case, both developed for the thermodynamic system-bath model. Thus, we clarify the conditions for thermodynamics to be valid even for small systems described by Hamiltonians and establish a basis for extending thermodynamics to non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity in the form of an exponent into the original theory of Haldane. The dependence of the statistical correlation on indistinguishability is highlighted. Using this modified theory, a quasi-classical derivation of intermediate statistics is shown where indistinguishability can be introduced into distinguishable systems in the form of a statistical correlation. The final result is equivalent to the classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES), which was derived earlier using a purely classical route. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.</description>

      <title>Universality in the 2d quasi-periodic Ising model and Harris-Luck irrelevance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01736v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that in the 2d Ising Model with a weak bidimensional quasi-periodic disorder in the interaction, the critical behavior is the same as in the non-disordered case, that is the critical exponents for the specific heat and energy-energy correlations are identical and no logarithmic corrections are present. The disorder produces a quasi-periodic modulation of the amplitude of the correlations and a renormalization of the velocities, that is the coefficients of the rescaling of positions, and of the critical temperature. The result establishes the validity of the prediction based on the Harris-Luck criterion and it provides the first rigorous proof of universality in the Ising model in presence of quasi-periodic disorder in both directions and for any angle. Small divisors are controlled assuming a Diophantine condition on the frequencies and convergence of the series is proved by Renormalization Group analysis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Work Reservoirs at the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17815v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When reformulated as a resource theory, thermodynamics can analyze system behaviors in the single-shot regime. In this, the work required to implement state transitions is bounded by {\alpha}-Renyi divergences and so differs in identifying efficient operations compared to stochastic thermodynamics. Thus, a detailed understanding of the difference between stochastic and resource-theoretic thermodynamics is needed. To this end, we explore reversibility in the single-shot regime, generalizing the two-level work reservoirs used there to multi-level work reservoirs. This achieves reversibility in any transition in the single-shot regime. Building on this, we systematically develop multi-level work reservoirs in the nondissipation regime with and without catalysts. The resource-theoretic results show that two-level work reservoirs undershoot Landauer's bound, misleadingly implying energy dissipation during computation. In contrast, we demonstrate that multilevel work reservoirs achieve Landauer's bound while producing arbitrarily low entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a computational strategy to quantify the temperature evolution of the timescales and lengthscales over which dynamic facilitation affects the relaxation dynamics of glass-forming liquids at low temperatures, that requires no assumption about the nature of the dynamics. In two glass models, we find that dynamic facilitation depends strongly on temperature, leading to a subdiffusive spreading of relaxation events which we characterize using a temperature-dependent dynamic exponent. We also establish that this temperature evolution represents a major contribution to the increase of the structural relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Multiple quantum Mpemba effect: exceptional points and oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of exceptional points and complex eigenvalues on the occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect. To this end, we study a two-level driven dissipative system subjected to an oscillatory electric field and dissipative coupling with the environment. We find that both exceptional points and complex eigenvalues can lead to $multiple$ quantum Mpemba effect. It occurs in an observable when time evolved copies corresponding to two different initial conditions, one initially having higher observable value compared to the other and both relaxing towards the same steady state, intersect each other more than once during their relaxation process. Each of the intersections denotes a quantum Mpemba effect and marks the reversal of identities between the two copies i.e. the copy with higher observable value before the intersection becomes the lower valued copy (and vice versa) after the intersection. Such multiple intersections originate from additional algebraic time dependence at the exceptional points and due to oscillatory relaxation in the case of complex eigenvalues. We provide analytical results for quantum Mpemba effect in the density matrix in presence of coherence. Depending on the control parameters (drive and dissipation), observables such as energy, von Neumann entropy, temperature etc. exhibit either single or multiple quantum Mpemba effect. However, the distance from steady state measured in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence shows only single quantum Mpemba effect although the corresponding speed gives rise to either single or multiple quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Weight fluctuations in (deep) linear neural networks and a derivation of the inverse-variance flatness relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stationary (late-time) training regime of single- and two-layer underparameterized linear neural networks within the continuum limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for synthetic Gaussian data. In the case of a single-layer network in the weakly underparameterized regime, the spectrum of the noise covariance matrix deviates notably from the Hessian, which can be attributed to the broken detailed balance of SGD dynamics. The weight fluctuations are in this case generally anisotropic, but effectively experience an isotropic loss. For an underparameterized two-layer network, we describe the stochastic dynamics of the weights in each layer and analyze the associated stationary covariances. We identify the inter-layer coupling as a distinct source of anisotropy for the weight fluctuations. In contrast to the single-layer case, the weight fluctuations are effectively subject to an anisotropic loss, the flatness of which is inversely related to the fluctuation variance. We thereby provide an analytical derivation of the recently observed inverse variance-flatness relation in a model of a deep linear neural network.</description>

      <title>Emergent Topology in Many-Body Dissipative Quantum Matter</title>

Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics of any multiplayer game on regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplayer games on graphs are at the heart of theoretical descriptions of key evolutionary processes that govern vital social and natural systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we solve this by drawing an analogy with the Balls-and-Boxes problem, based on which we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time. As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population. Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations, in two and three dimensions. Based on scaling analyses, we show that fluctuations of the jamming density in finite-sized systems have important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of the first-order transition with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems where sample-to-sample fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the nature and behavior of the jamming transition can be understood within the developed theoretical framework of the athermally driven random-field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. The method is readily extendable to systems in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

      <title>Computing macroscopic reaction rates in reaction-diffusion systems using Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction-diffusion models are employed to represent many complex physical, biological, societal, and ecological systems. The macroscopic reaction rates describing the large-scale kinetics in such systems are effective, scale-dependent parameters that need to be either measured experimentally or computed using a microscopic model. In a Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, microscopic probabilities for specific events to happen serve as the input control parameters. Finding the functional dependence of emergent macroscopic rates on the microscopic probabilities is a difficult problem, and there is no systematic analytical way to achieve this goal. Therefore, we introduce a straightforward numerical method of using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the macroscopic reaction rates by directly obtaining the count statistics of how many events occur per simulation time step. Our technique is first tested on well-understood fundamental examples, namely restricted birth processes, diffusion-limited two-particle coagulation, and two-species pair annihilation kinetics. Next we utilize the thus gained experience to investigate how the microscopic algorithmic probabilities become coarse-grained into effective macroscopic rates in more complex model systems such as the Lotka--Volterra model for predator-prey competition and coexistence, as well as the rock-paper-scissors or cyclic Lotka--Volterra model as well as its May--Leonard variant that capture population dynamics with cyclic dominance motifs. Thereby we achieve a deeper understanding of coarse-graining in spatially extended stochastic reaction systems and the nontrivial relationships between the associated microscopic and macroscopic model parameters. The proposed technique should generally provide a useful means to better fit Monte Carlo simulation results to experimental or observational data.</description>

      <title>Interacting quasiperiodic spin chains in the prethermal regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the study of many-body localization (MBL) in strongly disordered interacting spin chains has emphasized the importance of distinguishing finite time prethermal behavior from long time and large volume asymptotics. We re-examine a reported non-ergodic extended (NEE) regime in the interacting quasiperiodic Ganeshan-Pixley-Das Sarma model from this perspective, and propose that this regime is a prethermal feature. Indeed, we argue that the NEE regime may be identified through a change in the functional form of spin-spin autocorrelation functions, demonstrating that the NEE regime is distinguishable within intermediate-time dynamics. This is in contrast with existing conjectures relating the NEE regime to the presence of an asymptotic mobility edge in the single-particle spectrum. Thus, we propose a mechanism for the formation of an NEE regime which does not rely on asymptotic properties of the spin chain. Namely, we propose that the NEE regime emerges due to regularly spaced deep wells in the disorder potential. The highly detuned sites suppress spin transport across the system, effectively cutting the chain, and producing a separation of time scales between the spreading of different operators. To support this proposal, we show that the NEE phenomenology also occurs in random models with deep wells but with no mobility edges, and does not occur in quasiperiodic models with mobility edges but with no deep wells. Our results support the broad conclusion that there is not a sharp distinction between the dynamics of quasiperiodically and randomly disordered systems in the prethermal regime. More specifically, we find that generic interacting quasiperiodic models do not have stable intermediate dynamical phases arising from their single-particle mobility edges, and that NEE phenomenology in such models is transient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that driving optical phonons above a threshold fluence induces spatiotemporal orders, where material properties oscillate at an incommensurate wavevector $q_0$ in space and at half the drive frequency in time. The order is robust against temperature on timescales much larger than the lifetime of the excited modes and can be accompanied by a static $2q_0$ modulation. We make predictions for time-resolved diffraction and provide estimates for candidate materials. Our results show the possibility of using THz waves in solids to realize tunable incommensurate order on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Toward mean-field bound for critical temperature on Nishimori line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation establishes a lower bound of the true critical inverse temperature in a broad class of ferromagnetic spin models. This is referred to as the mean-field bound for the critical temperature. In this study, we explored the possibility of a corresponding mean-field bound for the critical temperature in Ising spin glass models with Gaussian randomness on the Nishimori line. On this line, the critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation is given by $\beta_{MF}^{NL}=\sqrt{1/z}$, where $z$ is the coordination number. Using the Griffiths inequalities on the Nishimori line, we proved that there is zero spontaneous magnetization in the high-temperature region $\beta &lt; \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. In other words, the true critical inverse temperature $\beta_c^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line is always bounded by $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in obtaining the corresponding mean-field bound $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line.</description>

      <title>Free energy equivalence between mean-field models and nonsparsely diluted mean-field models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. We prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models with different parameters in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results are a broad generalization of the results of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model) with different parameters.</description>
