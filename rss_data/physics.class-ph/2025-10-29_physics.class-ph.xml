      <title>Tracking the normal modes of an overpass highway bridge using Distributed Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) of ambient vibrations is a promising technique in the context of structural health monitoring of civil engineering structures. The methodology uses Rayleigh backscattered light from small deformations at different locations of the sensed fiber-optic cable, turning it into a large array of equally distributed strain sensors. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using DAS technology to record dynamic strain used for modal identification through the Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) of a strut-frame bridge overpassing the A8 highway in southeastern France. Modal identification using DAS data is successful despite its predominantly axial sensitivity (along fiber), though the help of three-component seismometers is useful for discriminating the main motion direction of each identified mode. The identification of 1 bridge's normal modes with unprecedented spatial resolution is obtained from the lowest (transverse and longitudinal) modes to high-order modes that present significant vertical motion. In addition, strong seasonal effects are observed in both the absolute frequency values and the modal shapes of the first transverse and longitudinal modes of the bridge, comparing ambient vibration testing and DAS surveys carried out in the summer and winter periods.</description>

      <title>Analytic Harmonic Tunable Closed Orbits of Trapped N-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of each particle in an N body system of identical masses interacting via an attractive or repulsive pairwise linear force law, the "Swarm," and with an external attractive or repulsive linear force law, the "Trap," is considered. In all Swarm and Trap combinations the motion of all N particles is completely separable and positions are found as a function of time in simple analytic form. in all attractive Traps the center of mass of the Swarm is bound to the center of the trap. For attractive or weakly repulsive Swarms in an attractive Trap the particles are bound to the center of mass of the Swarm and an infinite set of Swarm to Trap force constant ratios result in every particle executing a closed periodic orbit. Figures are provided of trajectories for various combinations of Swarm and Trap force constants. The derivations are suitable for the advanced undergraduate classroom.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Thermodynamic Limit of an Ideal Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a gas confined in a container, particle-wall interactions produce modifications to the partition function involving the average surface density of gas particles. While such correlations have a vanishing effect in the thermodynamic limit, examining them is beneficial for a sharper understanding of how the limit is attained. We contrast a classical and a quantum model of particle-wall correlations within the canonical ensemble.</description>

      <title>The stress-energy distributional multipole for both uncharged and charged dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the distributional uncharged and charged stress-energy tensors. These are integrals, along a worldline, of derivatives of the delta-function. These distributions are also multipoles and they are prescribed to any order. They represent an extended region of non-self-interacting uncharged or charged dust, shrunken to a single point in space. We show that the uncharged dust stress-energy multipole is divergence-free, while the divergence of the charged dust stress-energy multipole is given by the current and the external electromagnetic field. We show that they can be obtained by squeezing a regular dust stress-energy tensor onto the worldine. We discuss the aforementioned calculations in a coordinate-free manner.</description>
