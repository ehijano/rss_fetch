      <title>On qc compatibility of satellite copies of the Mandelbrot set: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mandelbrot set is a fractal which classifies the behaviour of complex quadratic polynomials. Although its remarkably simple definition: $\mathcal{M}:=\{c \in \mathbb{C}\,|\,Q_c(0)^n \nrightarrow \infty \mbox{ as } n\rightarrow \infty, \mbox{ where } Q_c(z)=z^2+c\}$, it is a central object in complex dynamics, and it has been charming and intriguing since it has first been defined and drawn. A fascinating fact is the presence of little copies of the Mandelbrot set in the Mandelbrot set itself (and in many other parameter planes). There exist two different kinds of little copies of the Mandelbrot set within the Mandelbrot set: the primitive copies, visually similar to the Mandelbrot set with a cusp at the root of the principal hyperbolic component, and satellite copies, whose principal hyperbolic component has no cusp, i.e. has smooth boundary across the root point. Lyubich proved that the primitive copies of $\mathcal{M}$ satisfy a stronger regularity condition: they are quasiconformally homeomorphic to $\mathcal{M}$. The satellite copies are homeomorphic to $\mathcal{M}$, but the homeomorphism is only quasiconformal outside neighbourhoods of the root. The question that remained open was: are the satellite copies mutually quasiconformally homeomorphic? In a previous work, we showed that, satellite copies with rotation numbers with different denominators are not quasiconformally homeomorphic. Here we complete the picture, by showing that for any $q$ the satellite copies $\mathcal{M}_{p/q}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{p'/q}$ of the Mandelbrot set $\mathcal{M}$ for rotation numbers with the same denominator $q$ are quasiconformal homeomorphic.</description>

      <title>Traveling wave solutions of the Burgers-Huxley equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the traveling wave solutions of the Burgers-Huxley equation from a geometric point of view via the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations. By using the Poincar\'e compactification we study the global phase portraits of a family of polynomial ordinary differential equations in the plane related to the Burgers-Huxley equation. We obtain the traveling wave solutions and their asymptotic behaviors from the orbits that connect equilibrium points taking into account the restrictions of the studied equation.</description>

      <title>A measure-theoretic expansion exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion exponent (or expansion constant) for maps was introduced by Schreiber in \cite{s}. In this paper, we introduce the analogous exponent for measures. We shall prove the following results: The expansion exponent of a measurable maps is equal to the minimum of the expansion exponent taken over the Borel probability measures. In particular, a map expands small distances (in the sense of Reddy \cite{r}) if and only if every Borel probability has positive expansion exponent. Any nonatomic invariant measure with positive expansion exponent is positively expansive in the sense of \cite{m}. For ergodic invariant measures, the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is bounded below by the product of the expansion exponent and the measure upper capacity. As a consequence, any ergodic invariant measure with both positive upper capacity and positive expansion exponent must have positive entropy.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of the bounded hyperbolic components of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local connectivity and Hausdorff dimension for the boundaries of the bounded hyperbolic components in the space $\mathcal P_d$ of polynomials of degree $d\geq 3$. It is shown that for any non disjoint-type bounded hyperbolic component $\mathcal H\subset \mathcal P_d$, the locally connected part of $\partial\mathcal H$, along each regular boundary strata, has full Hausdorff dimension $2d-2$.
  An essential innovation in our argument involves analyzing how the canonical parameterization of the hyperbolic component--realized via Blaschke products over a mapping scheme--extends to the boundary. This framework allows us to study three key aspects of $\partial \mathcal H$: the local connectivity structure, the perturbation behavior, and the local Hausdorff dimensions.</description>

      <title>Optimal linear response for Anosov diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that an Anosov diffeomorphism $T$ enjoys linear response of its SRB measure with respect to infinitesimal perturbations $T_2$. For a fixed observation function $c$, we develop a theory to optimise the response of the SRB-expectation of $c$. Our approach is based on the response of the transfer operator on the anisotropic Banach spaces of Gou\"ezel-Liverani. For any non-constant $c$ we prove that the optimising perturbation $T_2$ exists and is unique, and we provide explicit expressions for the Fourier coefficients of $T_2$. We develop an efficient Fourier-based numerical scheme to approximate the optimal vector field $T_2$, along with a proof of convergence. The utility of our approach is illustrated in two numerical examples, by localising SRB measures with small, optimally selected, perturbations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a finite number of orientation preserving $C^2$ interval diffeomorphisms and apply them randomly in such a way that the expected Lyapunov exponents at the boundary points are positive. We prove the exponential mixing, with respect to the unique stationary measure supported on the interior of the interval. The key step is to show the exponential synchronization in average.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics of planar discrete type-K competitive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a continuously differentiable Kolmogorov map defined from the nonnegative orthant to itself, a type-K competitive system is defined. Under the assumptions that the system is dissipative and the origin is a repeller, the global dynamics of such systems is investigated. A (weakly) type-K retrotone map is defined on a bounded set, which is backward monotone in some order. Under certain conditions, the dynamics of a type-K competitive system is the dynamics of a type-K retrotone map. Under these conditions, there exists a compact invariant set A that is the global attractor of the system on the nonnegative orthant exluding the origin. Some basic properties of A are established and remaining problems are listed for further investigation for general N-dimensional systems. These problems are completely solved for planar type-K competitive systems: every forward orbit is eventually monotone and converges to a fixed point; the global attractor A consists of two monotone curves each of which is a one-dimensional compact invariant manifold. A concrete example is provided to demonstrate the results for planar systems.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium Learning In Large Populations With First Order Payoff Modifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Nash equilibrium learning -- convergence of the population state to a suitably defined Nash equilibria set -- for a class of payoff dynamical mechanism with a first order modification. The first order payoff modification can model aspects of the agents' bounded rationality, anticipatory or averaging terms in the payoff mechanism, or first order Pad\'e approximations of delays. To obtain our main results, we apply a combination of two nonstandard system-theoretic passivity notions.</description>

      <title>Mean-field and fluctuations for hub dynamics in heterogeneous random networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a class of heterogeneous random networks, where each node dynamics is a random dynamical system, interacting with neighbor nodes via a random coupling function, we characterize the hub behavior as the mean-field, subject to statistically controlled fluctuations. In particular, we prove that the fluctuations are small over exponentially long time scales and obtain Berry-Esseen estimates for the fluctuation statistics at any fixed time. Our results provide a mathematical explanation for several numerical observations, including the scaling relation between system size and frequency of large fluctuations, as well as system size induced desynchronization. To our best knowledge, these are the first characterizations of mean-field fluctuations on networks with a degree distribution that follows a power-law, a common feature for many realistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal algorithm to derive a macroscopic dynamics from the microscopic dynamical system via the averaging process and symplecto-contact reduction was introduced by Jin-wook Lim and the second-named author in [LO23]. They apply the algorithm to derive non-equilibrium thermodynamics from the statistical mechanics utilizing the relative information entropy as a generating function of the associated thermodynamic equilibrium. In the present paper, we apply this algorithm to the contact Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We describe a procedure of obtaining a discrete set of dynamical invariants of the given contact Hamiltonian system, or more generally of a contact multi-Hamiltonian system in a canonical way by deriving a (finite-dimensional non-equilibrium) thermodynamic system. We call this reduction the thermodynamic reduction of contact dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of unlikely intersections for automorphisms of Markov surfaces of positive entropy. We show for certain parameters that two automorphisms with positive entropy share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they share a common iterate. Our proof uses arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties, the theory of laminar currents and quasi-Fuchsian representation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that two automorphisms of an affine surface with dynamical degree strictly larger than 1 share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they have the same periodic points. We construct canonical heights for these automorphisms and use arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties following the work of Yuan and Zhang. When the base field is not a number field or the function field of a curve we use the theory of Moriwaki heights to prove the result.</description>

      <title>Paracomposition Operators and Paradifferential Reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducibility methods, aiming to simplify systems by conjugating them to those with constant coefficients, are crucial for studying the existence of quasiperiodic solutions. In KAM theory for PDEs, these methods help address the invertibility of linearized operators that arise in a Nash-Moser/KAM type scheme. The goal of this paper is to prove paradifferential reducibility results, enabling the reduction of nonlinear equations themselves, rather than just their linearizations, to constant coefficient form, modulo smoothing terms. As an initial application, we demonstrate the existence of quasiperiodic solutions for certain hyperbolic systems. Despite the small denominator problem, our proof does not rely on traditional Nash-Moser/KAM-type schemes, but instead on the Banach fixed point theorem. To achieve this, we develop two key toolsets. The first focuses on the calculus of paracomposition operators introduced by Alinhac, interpreted as the flow map of a paraproduct vector field. We refine this approach to establish new estimates that precisely capture the dependence on the diffeomorphism in question. The second toolset addresses two classical reducibility problems, one for matrix differential operators and the other for nearly parallel vector fields on torus. We resolve these problems by paralinearizing the conjugacy equation and exploiting, at the paradifferential level, the specific algebraic structure of conjugacy problems, akin to Zehnder's approximate Nash-Moser approach.</description>

      <title>The geometry of totally geodesic subvarieties of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a semisimplicity result for the boundary, in the corresponding Deligne-Mumford compactification, of a totally geodesic subvariety of a moduli space of Riemann surfaces. At the level of Teichm\"uller space, this semisimplicity theorem gives that each component of the boundary is a product of simple factors, each of which behaves metrically like a diagonal embedding. Building on this result, we also show that the associated totally geodesic submanifolds of Teichm\"uller space and orbifold fundamental groups are hierarchically hyperbolic.
  The proof intertwines in a novel way results and perspectives originating in dynamics, algebraic geometry, geometric group theory, and both classical and modern Teichm\"uller theory. It establishes both new rigidity and new flexibility for totally geodesic submanifolds and their associated varieties and orbifold fundamental groups and provides a rich set of new tools for the study of these objects.</description>
