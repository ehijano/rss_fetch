      <title>Offloading Revenue Maximization in Multi-UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing for Video Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional video transmission systems assisted by multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are often limited by computing resources, making it challenging to meet the demands for efficient video processing. To solve this challenge, this paper presents a multi-UAV-assisted Device-to-Device (D2D) mobile edge computing system for the maximization of task offloading profits in video stream transmission. In particular, the system enables UAVs to collaborate with idle user devices to process video computing tasks by introducing D2D communications. To maximize the system efficiency, the paper jointly optimizes power allocation, video transcoding strategies, computing resource allocation, and UAV trajectory. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is formulated as a Markov decision process and solved relying on the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. Numerical results indicate that the proposed TD3 algorithm performs a significant advantage over other traditional algorithms in enhancing the overall system efficiency.</description>

      <title>How Good is ChatGPT in Giving Adaptive Guidance Using Knowledge Graphs in E-Learning Environments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-learning environments are increasingly harnessing large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for tailored educational support. This study introduces an approach that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with LLMs to offer nuanced student assistance. By evaluating past and ongoing student interactions, the system identifies and appends the most salient learning context to prompts directed at the LLM. Central to this method is the knowledge graph's role in assessing a student's comprehension of topic prerequisites. Depending on the categorized understanding (good, average, or poor), the LLM adjusts its guidance, offering advanced assistance, foundational reviews, or in-depth prerequisite explanations, respectively. Preliminary findings suggest students could benefit from this tiered support, achieving enhanced comprehension and improved task outcomes. However, several issues related to potential errors arising from LLMs were identified, which can potentially mislead students. This highlights the need for human intervention to mitigate these risks. This research aims to advance AI-driven personalized learning while acknowledging the limitations and potential pitfalls, thus guiding future research in technology and data-driven education.</description>

      <title>Self-contained relaxation-based dynamical Ising machines</title>

Abstract: Dynamical Ising machines are based on continuous dynamical systems evolving from a generic initial state to a state strongly related to the ground state of the classical Ising model on a graph. Reaching the ground state is equivalent to finding the maximum (weighted) cut of the graph, which presents the Ising machines as an alternative way to solving and investigating NP-complete problems. Among the dynamical models, relaxation-based models are distinguished by their relations with guarantees of performance achieved in time scaling polynomially with the problem size. However, the terminal states of such machines are essentially non-binary, necessitating special post-processing relying on disparate computing. We show that an Ising machine implementing a special continuous dynamical system (called the V${}_2$ model) solves the rounding problem dynamically. We prove that the V${}_2$ model, starting from an arbitrary non-binary state, terminates in a state that trivially rounds to a binary state with the cut at least as big as obtained by optimal rounding of the initial state. Besides showing that relaxation-based dynamical Ising machines can be made self-contained, this result presents a non-Boolean realization of solving a non-trivial information processing task on Ising machines. Moreover, we prove that if the initial state of the V${}_2$-machine is a random limited amplitude perturbation of a binary state, the machine progresses to a state with at least as high cut as that of the initial binary state. Since the probability of improving the cut is finite, this shows that the V${}_2$-machine with random agitations converges to a maximum cut state almost surely.</description>
