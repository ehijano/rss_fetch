      <title>Algebraic properties of tensor product of modules over a field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be commutative Noetherian algebras over an arbitrary field $\Bbbk$ such that $A \otimes_\Bbbk B$ is Noetherian. We consider ideals $I$ and $J$ of $A$ and $B$, respectively, as well as nonzero finitely generated modules $L$ and $N$ over $A$ and $B$, respectively. In this paper, we investigate certain algebraic properties of the $A \otimes_\Bbbk B$-module $L\otimes_{\Bbbk} N$, which are often inherited from the properties of the $A$-module $L$ and the $B$-module $N$. Specifically, we provide characterizations for the Cohen-Macaulayness, generalized Cohen-Macaulayness, and sequentially Cohen-Macaulayness of $L\otimes_{\Bbbk} N$ with respect to the ideal $I \otimes_\Bbbk B + A \otimes_\Bbbk J$, in terms of the corresponding properties for $L$ and $N$ with respect to $I$ and $J$, respectively.</description>

      <title>An Upper Bound on Generalized Cospectral Mates of Oriented Graphs Using Skew-Walk Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D$ be an oriented graph with skew adjacency matrix $S(D)$. Two oriented graphs $D$ and $C$ are said to share the same generalized skew spectrum if $S(D)$ and $S(C)$ have the same eigenvalues, and $J-S(D)$ and $J-S(C)$ also have the same eigenvalues, where $J$ is the all-ones matrix. Such graphs that are not isomorphic are generalized cospectral mates. We derive tight upper bounds on the number of non-isomorphic generalized cospectral mates an oriented graph can admit, based on arithmetic criteria involving the determinant of its skew-walk matrix. As a special case, we also provide a criterion for an oriented graph to be weakly determined by its generalized skew spectrum (WDGSS), that is, its only generalized cospectral mate is its transpose. These criteria relate directly to the controllability of graphs, a fundamental concept in the control of networked systems, thereby connecting spectral characterization of graphs to graph controllability.</description>

      <title>A mixed characteristic analogue of the perfection of rings and its almost Cohen-Macaulay property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over a complete Noetherian local domain of mixed characteristic with perfect residue field, we construct a perfectoid ring which is similar to an explicit representation of a perfect closure in positive characteristic. Then we demonstrate that this perfectoid ring is almost Cohen-Macaulay in the sense of almost ring theory. The proof of this result uses Andr\'e's flatness lemma along with Riemann's extension theorem. We stress that the idea partially originates from the "perfectoidization" in the theory of prismatic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Tensor products of $d$-fold matrix factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a pair of elements $f$ and $g$ in a commutative ring $Q$. Given a matrix factorization of $f$ and another of $g$, the tensor product of matrix factorizations, which was first introduced by Kn\"orrer and later generalized by Yoshino, produces a matrix factorization of the sum $f+g$. We will study the tensor product of $d$-fold matrix factorizations, with a particular emphasis on understanding when the construction has a non-trivial direct sum decomposition. As an application of our results, we construct indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay and Ulrich modules over hypersurface domains of a certain form.</description>

      <title>$F$-pure threshold for the symmetric determinantal ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09978v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a value for the $F$-pure threshold at the maximal homogeneous ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of the symmetric determinantal ring over a field of prime characteristic. The answer is characteristic independent, so we immediately get the log canonical threshold in characteristic zero as well.</description>

      <title>Monomial ideals whose all matching powers are Cohen-Macaulay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we aim to classify monomial ideals whose all matching powers are Cohen-Macaulay. We especially focus our attention on edge ideals. The Cohen-Macaulayness of the last matching power of an edge ideal is characterized, providing an algebraic analogue of the famous Tutte theorem regarding graphs having a perfect matching. For chordal graphs, very well-covered graphs and Cameron-Walker graphs, we completely solve our problem.</description>

      <title>The $F$-pure threshold of a Schubert cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $F$-pure threshold is the characteristic $p$ counter part of the log canonical threshold in characteristic zero. It is a numerical invariant associated to the singularities of a variety, hence computing its value is important. We give a closed formula for the $F$-pure threshold of the irrelevant maximal ideal of Schubert cycles, which are the homogeneous coordinate rings of Schubert subvarieties of a Grassmannian. The main point of the computation is to give an explicit formula for the $a$-invariant of a Schubert cycle. The derivation of both formulas is made possible through the combinatorics of the underlying poset of these rings.</description>

      <title>Computing the $F$-pure Threshold of Flag Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the $F$-pure threshold of the natural cone over flag varieties in characteristic $p&gt;0$. Our calculations are mainly focused on flag varieties that are arithmetically Gorenstein, but we offer some results in the non-Gorenstein case. Our goal is to determine the $a$-invariant of the cone. As a result, the $F$-pure thresholds we find are independent of the characteristic $p$, hence one immediately gets the value of the log canonical threshold of flags in characteristic 0 as well.</description>
