      <title>The First RELHIC? Cloud-9 is a Starless Gas Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FAST observations have recently identified a compact HI cloud (hereafter Cloud-9) in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M94. This identification has been confirmed independently by VLA and GBT observations. Cloud-9 has the same recession velocity as M94, and is therefore at a similar distance ($\sim$4.4 Mpc). It is compact ($\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold ($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\sim 10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$. Here we present deep HST/ACS imaging designed to search for a luminous stellar counterpart. We visually rule out the presence of any dwarf galaxy with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{3.5}$$M_{\odot}$. A more robust color-magnitude diagram-based analysis rules out a 10$^{4}$$M_{\odot}$ stellar counterpart with 99.5$\%$ confidence. The non-detection of a luminous component reinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI Cloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make Cloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud. This provides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model, namely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on sub-galactic mass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>The first detection of cosmic-ray excited H$_2$ in interstellar space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars and planets form within cold, dark molecular clouds. In these dense regions, where starlight cannot penetrate, cosmic rays (CRs) are the dominant source of ionization -- driving interstellar chemistry(Dalgarno (2006, PNAS, 103, 12269)), setting the gas temperature(Goldsmith et al. (1969, ApJ, 158, 173)), and enabling coupling to magnetic fields(McKee &amp; Ostriker (2007, ARA&amp;A, 45, 565; arXiv:0707.3514)). Together, these effects regulate the collapse of clouds and the onset of star formation. Despite this importance, the cosmic-ray ionization rate, $\zeta$, has never been measured directly. Instead, this fundamental parameter has been loosely inferred from indirect chemical tracers and uncertain assumptions, leading to published values that span nearly two orders of magnitude and limiting our understanding of star formation physics. Here, we report the first direct detection of CR-excited vibrational H$_2$ emission, using \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations of the starless core Barnard 68 (B68). The observed emission pattern matches theoretical predictions for CR excitation precisely, confirming a decades-old theoretical proposal long considered observationally inaccessible. This result enables direct measurement of $\zeta$, effectively turning molecular clouds into natural, light-year-sized, cosmic-ray detectors. It opens a transformative observational window into the origin, propagation, and role of cosmic rays in star formation and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Tails: Star Formation and Stripping in Jellyfish Galaxies in the Strong Lensing Cluster MACS J0138.0-2155</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of ram-pressure stripping on four galaxies within the massive, strong-lensing cluster MACS-J0138.0-2155 ($z=0.336$). Of these, three are classified as jellyfish galaxies, with significant elongated tails. Two of these jellyfish galaxies, J1 and J2, are in a late-stage of stripping and show post-starburst features within their disk regions with star formation only in the tails. Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopic data, we spatially resolve the stellar and gas kinematics to examine extraplanar gas associated with ram-pressure stripping. We complement this analysis with optical and near-infrared imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to visualize the galactic structure of each member. The jellyfish galaxies are all blue-shifted with respect to the cluster and show velocity gradients of a few hundred $\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ across their tails. From the resolved gas kinematics, we derive H$\alpha$-based star formation rates; these are generally low reaching a maximum of approximately 0.49 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}kpc^{-2}}$ in galaxy J3. We also report the kinematics for galaxy J4, which lies in the foreground of the cluster but close in projection to one of the lensed arcs.</description>

      <title>MEGA: Spectrophotometric SED Fitting of Little Red Dots Detected in JWST MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze eight spectroscopically confirmed Little Red Dots (LRDs) at redshifts z = 5.1-8.7 with JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI data. The LRDs have red NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W &gt; 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, -0.5 &lt; F444W - F770W &lt; 0.5, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The LRDs have -1.0 &lt; F1000W - F1500W &lt; 1.1, suggestive of non-uniform rest near-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to assess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases of: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic nuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs favor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model can fully reproduce all of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and broad H$_\alpha$ have SEDs that can be reproduced with hot, dense-gas (log T/K=5-5.7, log n/cm$^{-3}$ = 9-11) models with low dust attenuation (A(V)~ 0.5mag). However, these models require an additional thermal component (800-1400K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to reproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission from the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent with literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require log L$_{bol}$/L$_\odot$ &lt;12. These results suggest that our LRDs cannot be modeled entirely with standard templates, but instead require a novel treatment of gas conditions, AGN and star-formation.</description>

      <title>Low-ionization structures in planetary nebulae -- IV. The molecular hydrogen counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Low-ionization structures (LISs), found in all morphological types of planetary nebulae (PNe), are small-scale features prominent in emission from low-ionization species such as [N ii], [S ii], [O ii] and [O i]. Observational and theoretical efforts have aimed to better understand their origin and nature. Recently, the detection of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) emission associated with LISs in a few PNe has added a new piece to the puzzle of understanding these nebular structures. Aims. Although observational studies indicate that LISs are characterized by lower electron densities than their host PNe, model predictions suggest higher total densities in these structures. The detection of H$_2$ emission from LISs in more PNe could help reconcile the observations with model predictions. Methods. Observations of five PNe with already known LISs were conducted using the Near InfraRed Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) mounted on the 8 m Gemini North telescope. A narrow band filter, centered on H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\mu}$m emission line, was used along with a continuum filter, to ensure continuum subtraction. Results. We present a deep, high-angular resolution near-IR narrowband H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) imaging survey of five Galactic PNe with LISs. We nearly double the sample of LISs detected in the H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\mu}$m emission line as well as the number of host PNe. These findings allows us to prove that the systematically lower electron density in LISs --relative to the rims and shells of their host nebulae-- is linked to the presence of H2 molecular gas. Additionally, we provide the first estimation of the excited H$_2$ molecular mass in LISs, which is found between 200 and 5000 times lower than the corresponding ionized gas mass.</description>

      <title>HI gas in the rejuvenated radio galaxy PKS 2014-55</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new high-spectral-resolution MeerKAT observations of $\mathrm{HI}$ absorption against the central region of the restarted, giant, X-shaped radio galaxy PKS2014-55, which exhibits morphological evidence of three distinct cycles of activity. We report a wide component $(\mathrm{FWHM}=38 \pm 7~\mathrm{kms^{-1}})$ redshifted to $96 \pm 50~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, a deep narrow detection $(\mathrm{FWHM}=19 \pm 6~\mathrm{kms^{-1}})$ redshifted to $160 \pm 40~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, and a shallow component $(\mathrm{FWHM}=22 \pm 6~\mathrm{kms^{-1}})$ redshifted to $240 \pm 40~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$. One of the three components exceeds the typical rotational velocity of $100~\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$, suggesting complex kinematics of the inflowing gas. These $\mathrm{HI}$ observations support the correlation between the occurrence of $\mathrm{HI}$ absorption and the rejuvenation of radio activity via possible galaxy-galaxy interactions.</description>

      <title>Ionized Gas Outflows and Shock-Heated Emission in the Highly Inclined Active Galaxy CGCG 012-070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) exhibit excess mid-infrared H$_2$ emission compared to star-forming galaxies, likely driven by outflows and shocks inferred from integrated spectra. We present optical IFU observations of the central 2\,kpc of the AGN host CGCG 012-070, selected for its pronounced H$_2$ emission excess, to map stellar and gas kinematics. The stellar velocity field is well described by a rotating disc with a line of nodes at $103^\circ \pm 4^\circ$, with the northwest side approaching and the southeast side receding. Gas kinematics, traced by strong emission lines, show two components: a narrow one ($\sigma \lesssim 200\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) in the disc plane following stellar motions, and a broad ($\sigma \gtrsim 300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) associated with outflows within the inner $\sim$1\,kpc. Disc gas emission is mainly driven by AGN photoionization, while the outflow also includes shock-heated gas, as indicated by flux ratio diagnostics. The outflows are radiatively driven, with a mass-outflow rate of $(0.067 \pm 0.026)\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and a kinetic coupling efficiency of 0.07%, potentially redistributing gas and contributing to maintenance-mode feedback in CGCG 012-070. Our results provide further evidence that the warm H$_2$ emission excess in nearby AGN is associated with shocks produced by outflows. Observations of other gas phases, such as cold molecular gas, are necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the outflows on the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>High sensitivity molecular line observations towards the L1544 pre-stellar core challenge current models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased sensitivity and spectral resolution of observed spectra towards the pre-stellar core L1544 are challenging the current physical and chemical models. With the aim of further constraining the structure of L1544 as well as assessing the completeness of chemical networks, we turn to radiative transfer modelling of observed molecular lines towards this source. We obtained high-sensitivity and high-spectral resolution observations of HCO+ (J = 1 - 0), CS (J = 2 - 1), C34S (J = 2 - 1), H2CO (J ,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,1,1), c-C3H2 (J,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,0,1), SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) and 34SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) with the IRAM 30m telescope towards the dust peak of L1544. A non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium radiative transfer code is coupled to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to model the observations. We find that with just one transition for each isotope, the modelling cannot find a global minimum that fits the observations. The derived fractional abundance profiles are compared to those computed with chemical models. The observed transitions trace gas components with distinct dynamics at different distances along the radius of the core. Moreover, the results evidence a poor reproduction of sulphur chemistry by chemical modelling and stresses the need to include a more consistent S-depletion process to accurately reproduce the S-chemistry towards dense cores.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Radial Metallicity Gradient-Age Relation in the Milky Way's Thin and Thick Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic disks typically exhibit a negative radial metallicity gradient, indicating faster enrichment in the inner regions. Recent studies report that this gradient becomes flatter with increasing stellar age in the Milky Way's (MW) thin disk, while the thick disk exhibits a mildly positive gradient across all ages. In this work, we revisit the metallicity gradient-age relation (MGAR) in both the thin and thick disks of the MW. We use spectroscopic data from LAMOST DR8 and stellar ages calibrated with asteroseismology. Our results show a steadily flattening MGAR in the thin disk and confirm a positive gradient $\sim0.013\,\mathrm{dex\,kpc^{-1}}$ in the thick disk. The flattening in the thin disk may be caused by large-scale radial migration induced by transient spiral arms, or by a time-dependent steepening of the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient as suggested by recent FIRE2 simulations. The positive gradient in the thick disk may reflect early enrichment of the outer regions by strong feedback or starburst-driven outflows in a turbulent, gas-rich proto-disk. These findings suggest distinct chemodynamical evolution paths for the MW's thin and thick disks and provide valuable constraints for future models of Galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>An isolated early-type dwarf galaxy that ran away from the group environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the quenching mechanisms in dwarf galaxies is crucial for constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this vein, isolated dwarf galaxies offer valuable insight by helping disentangle the relative roles of internal and environmental processes in shutting down star formation. Here we report the discovery of a quiescent early-type dwarf galaxy (dE), SDSS J011754.86+095819.0 (hereafter dE01+09), located in a nearly isolated environment at a projected distance of approximately one megaparsec from its most likely host group, the NGC 524 group. dE01+09 has M_r = -15.72 and g-r = 0.67 mag and its light profile is well described by a S\'ersic function with an index n = 1.1, consistent with typical dEs. Using optical spectroscopy from the DESI survey, we derive its simple stellar population properties, finding an intermediate luminosity-weighted age of 8.3$\pm$1.4 Gyr and a subsolar metallicity of -1.19$\pm$0.21 dex -- characteristics comparable to those of classical quiescent dEs. We propose that NGC 524 may represent an extreme example of group dynamics, in which a member galaxy, dE01+09, is ejected from its host group and subsequently evolves as an isolated system in the field.</description>

      <title>HSTPROMO Internal Proper Motion Kinematics of Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies: II. Velocity Anisotropy and Dark Matter Cusp Slope of Sculptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze three epochs of HST imaging over 20 years for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, measuring precise proper motions for 119 stars and combining them with 1760 existing line-of-sight velocities. This catalog yields the first radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild oblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching $\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in this series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy due to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical symmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of dark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain the inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity moments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree models from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on) configurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons ($i = 57.1$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark matter density slope of $\Gamma_{\rm dark} = 0.29^{+0.31}_{-0.41}$ within the radial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with $\Gamma_{\rm dark} \leq -1$ at 99.8% confidence. This confidence increases for lower inclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations. The results qualitatively agree with $\Lambda$CDM, SIDM, and Fuzzy DM scenarios that predict core formation, while our specific measurements provide quantitative constraints on the prescriptions of feedback, cross sections, or particle masses required by these models, respectively.</description>

      <title>Improved photometric redshift estimations through self-organising map-based data augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for the enhanced estimation of photometric redshifts using Self-Organising Maps (SOMs). Our method projects galaxy Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) onto a two-dimensional map, identifying regions that are sparsely sampled by existing spectroscopic observations. These under-sampled areas are then augmented with simulated galaxies, yielding a more representative spectroscopic training dataset. To assess the efficacy of this SOM-based data augmentation in the context of the forthcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we employ mock galaxy catalogues from the OpenUniverse2024 project and generate synthetic datasets that mimic the expected photometric selections of LSST after one (Y1) and ten (Y10) years of observation. We construct 501 degraded realisations by sampling galaxy colours, magnitudes, redshifts and spectroscopic success rates, in order to emulate the compilation of a wide array of realistic spectroscopic surveys. Augmenting the degraded mock datasets with simulated galaxies from the independent CosmoDC2 catalogues has markedly improved the performance of our photometric redshift estimates compared to models lacking this augmentation, particularly for high-redshift galaxies ($z_\mathrm{true} \gtrsim 1.5$). This improvement is manifested in notably reduced systematic biases and a decrease in catastrophic failures by up to approximately a factor of 2, along with a reduction in information loss in the conditional density estimations. These results underscore the effectiveness of SOM-based augmentation in refining photometric redshift estimation, thereby enabling more robust analyses in cosmology and astrophysics for the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>GW emission and relativistic dynamical friction in intermediate mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of preliminary simulations of intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) inside dark matter (DM) spikes accounting for post-Newtonian corrections the interaction between the two black holes up to the order 2.5 in $c^2$, as well as relativistic corrections to the dynamical friction (DF) force exerted by the DM distribution. We find that, incorporating relativity reduces of a factor $1/2$ the inspiral time, for equivalent initial orbital parameters, with respect to the purely classical estimates. Vice versa, neglecting the DF of the spike systematically yields longer inspiral times.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Relationship Between Swift Short Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows and their Host Galaxy Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive compilation of short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows in the X-ray, optical, and radio bands, comprising 150 events discovered primarily by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory over 2005-2023. We pair these observations with uniformly modeled host galaxies to understand how broadband afterglow luminosities are influenced by their environmental properties. We compare the X-ray and optical afterglow luminosities at 3 hr with projected physical and host-normalized galactocentric offsets, host stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, and stellar population age. In the radio band, we explore how these environmental properties may influence afterglow detectability. We find statistical support that X-ray afterglows are brighter in galaxies with younger ages, lower masses, and higher active star formation - trends that also scale with ISM density. While we also visualize these differences for optical afterglows, the only statistically significant trend is that they are brighter in hosts with higher SFR. We further find that X-ray (radio) afterglows are more luminous (more likely to be detected) at low projected offsets. Overall, this indicates that X-ray afterglow luminosity is the most predictable indicator of host environment among the three bands. We find the afterglow luminosities of three possible merger-driven long GRBs to be unremarkable compared to the traditional short GRB population, strengthening the case that these events arise from mergers. Finally we find that the estimated on-axis afterglow luminosity of GW170817 is in the faintest ~30%, aligning with its quiescent, old and massive host environment.</description>

      <title>Chaos and Carter: Extreme-mass-ratio systems of relativistic rotating black holes in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, where a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole, are prime sources of millihertz gravitational waves for upcoming space-based detectors. While most studies assume idealized vacuum backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in astrophysical environments, such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark matter spikes, disks and halos, that can significantly alter the orbital dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time, and map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of chaos. This manifests through resonant island and chaotic layer formations around transient orbital resonances in phase space; features that are otherwise completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit points. Non-integrability ensures that the periodicity of the central resonant point is shared throughout the island's geodesics, thus effectively enhancing the lifespan of resonances, beyond Kerr-based predictions. Therefore, they can subject distinct imprint on gravitational-wave signals, with significant consequences for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Using Symbolic Regression to Emulate the Radial Fourier Transform of the S\'ersic profile for Fast, Accurate and Differentiable Galaxy Profile Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy profile fitting is a ubiquitous technique that provides the backbone for photometric and morphological measurements in modern extragalactic surveys. A recent innovation in profile fitting algorithms is to render, or create, the model profile in Fourier space, which aims to provide faster and more accurate results. However, the most common parameterization, the S\'ersic profile, has no closed form Fourier transform, requiring the use of computationally expensive approximations. In this paper our goal is to develop an emulator to mimic the radial Fourier transform of the S\'ersic profile, for use in profile fitting. We first numerically compute the radial Fourier transform and demonstrate that it varies smoothly as a function of the S\'ersic index and $k$, the spatial frequency coordinate. Using this set of numerically calculated transforms as a training set, we use symbolic regression to discover an equation which approximates its behavior. This ensures the emulator will be based on computationally efficient and differentiable building blocks. We implement this novel rendering method in the pysersic profile fitter, and ensure it is accurate by conducting both injection-recovery tests using model galaxy profiles and applying multiple rendering methods to a real sample of galaxies in HSC-SSP imaging. Crucially, the Fourier emulator rendering technique enables measurements of morphological parameters of galaxies 2.5 times faster than standard methods with minimal loss in accuracy. This increased performance while maintaining accuracy is a step that ensures these tools can continue to scale with the ever-increasing flow of incoming data.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of young stars with APOGEE. I. Orion star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances in young G-, K-, and M-type stars (temperatures between 6500 and 3100 K) using infrared APOGEE-2 spectra. Atmospheric parameters were determined for 548 young stars in the Orion complex (Orion A, B, OB1, and $\lambda$ Ori) using the TONALLI code. For 340 slow rotators v sini $\leq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), we derived C, Mg, Si, K, Ti, and Fe abundances using 19 atomic lines, MARCS model atmospheres, and BACCHUS. To mitigate the impact of circumstellar material, we excluded stars with infrared excess identified via 2MASS and WISE photometry. We find sub-solar [X/H] abundance ratios, consistent across elements and among all four groups, suggesting a chemically homogeneous Orion complex. We computed [$\alpha$/Fe] from [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], obtaining a median of $-0.14 \pm 0.04$, about 0.10 dex lower than the value for nearby main-sequence stars ($-0.04 \pm 0.04$) at similar [Fe/H]. This result aligns with predictions from Galactic chemical evolution models. Furthermore, the median [C/H] abundance we derived for Orion agrees with previous estimations based on the analysis of the ionized gas of the Orion nebula. This work sets the stage for extending the analysis to stars with circumstellar material and higher rotational velocities, which will not only improve our understanding of Orion, but also provide critical insight into the formation and evolution of young stars, as well as the chemical evolution of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The Close Binary Properties of Massive Stars across Different Environments within the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze 4,859 O-stars in the OGLE-III photometric survey of the LMC, including 415 eclipsing binaries (EBs). After accounting for the geometrical probability of eclipses, the period distribution of O-type binaries across $P$ = 2.5-200 days follows a power-law $f_{\rm logP}$ $\propto$ (logP)$^{\Pi}$ with $\Pi$ = $-$0.34$\pm$0.06, which is skewed toward shorter periods compared to Opik's law ($\Pi$ = 0). We divide our O-stars into seven environments based on their clustering with B-stars and other O-stars. The EB fraction of O-stars in young clusters is 10.2%$\pm$0.6%, which matches the 10.8%$\pm$2.1% for O-stars in young Milky Way clusters. O-stars in old clusters exhibit a lower EB fraction of 5.5%$\pm$0.9% due to the effects of binary evolution. O-stars in young dense clusters, young sparse associations, and even low-mass clusters that formed in situ in the field have similar EB fractions. This uniformity suggests that the formation of close massive binaries depends on small-scale gas physics, e.g., fragmentation and migration within protostellar disks, whereas N-body interactions that scale with cluster density do not affect the close binary properties of massive stars that remain in clusters. Conversely, ejected O-stars in the field exhibit a lower close binary fraction. The EB fractions of field walkaways (projected velocities $v_{\rm proj}$ $&lt;$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) and field runaways ($v_{\rm proj}$ $&gt;$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) are 7.3%$\pm$1.0% and 4.7%$\pm$1.0%, respectively. These values suggest that most field O-stars were dynamically ejected via N-body interactions from their birth clusters, whereas field O-stars that formed in situ or were kicked from supernova explosions in binaries contribute 17% and $&lt;$28%, respectively, to the field population.</description>

      <title>Optimized Observation Sequencing in Low-Earth Orbit with the SPHEREx Survey Planning Software</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SPHEREx is a NASA infrared astronomy mission that launched on March 12th, 2025 and is operating successfully in low-Earth orbit (LEO). The mission is currently observing the entire sky in 102 spectral channels in four independent all-sky surveys and also achieves enhanced coverage in two deep fields. This data will resolve key science questions about the early universe, galaxy formation, and the origin of water and biogenic molecules. In this paper, we describe the survey planning software (SPS) that enables SPHEREx to observe efficiently while mitigating a range of operational challenges in LEO. Our optimal target selection algorithm achieves the required high coverage in both the All-Sky and Deep Surveys. The algorithm plans observations to stay within our time-varying allowable pointing zone, interleaves required data downlink passes, and mitigates outages due to the South Atlantic Anomaly and other events. As demonstrated by the sky coverage achieved in the first SPHEREx public data release, our approach is performing well in flight. The SPHEREx SPS is a key new capability that enables the mission to deliver groundbreaking science from LEO.</description>

      <title>Potassium abundances in extremely metal poor stars: Implications for nucleosynthesis in the final stages of massive star evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a potassium (K) abundance analysis in extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars based on high-resolution ($R\sim 60000$) spectra obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope, covering the K I resonance lines at 766 and 769 nm. One-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundances of K and other elements, including Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni, were derived using spectral synthesis. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections were applied to the K abundances by interpolating a precomputed grid of corrections based on stellar parameters and the LTE K abundance. We detected K I lines in seven stars with [Fe/H]$&lt; -3.0$ and derived upper limits for other stars in the same metallicity regime, making this sample well-suited for investigating the nucleosynthesis origins of K in the early universe. We found that the [K/Fe] and [K/Ca] ratios of the seven stars are enhanced relative to the solar value, with a scatter of approximately 0.1 dex, as small as the typical measurement uncertainty. Under the assumption that each star formed from gas purely enriched by a single or a few massive stars' supernovae, the small scatter in [K/Fe] and [K/Ca], contrasted with the $\sim$0.7 dex scatter in [Na/Mg] ratios (after NLTE correction), suggests that the production of K in massive stars or their supernovae is independent of the processes that drive Na/Mg variation. These findings demonstrate that K abundances in EMP stars, and their correlations with other elemental abundances, can serve as sensitive tracers of the physical mechanisms governing the final evolutionary stages of massive stars and their supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Group Spin Alignment with Cosmic Filament in the TNG Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the alignment between the spin vectors of galaxy groups and the axes of their nearest cosmic filaments using the TNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. By systematically analyzing a large sample of groups, we find a robust perpendicular alignment between group spin and filament orientation. Among all examined properties, only group mass and the distance to the nearest filament significantly affect the strength of this alignment: more massive groups and those closer to filaments exhibit a stronger perpendicular signal. In contrast, the alignment is largely insensitive to group richness, the stellar mass threshold used to select member galaxies, and redshift. We further quantify the bias introduced by using member galaxies as tracers of group spin, finding a typical misalignment angle of $\sim38^\circ$ between the spin measured from all dark matter particles and that inferred from member galaxies, independent of group richness or stellar mass cut. Our results provide a clear theoretical benchmark for interpreting observational measurements of spin-filament alignment and highlight the importance of considering group mass and environment. These findings help clarify the main factors influencing spin-filament alignment and provide useful context for future observational and theoretical studies of angular momentum in the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>Forecasting 21-cm power spectrum sensitivity to dark Matter-baryon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of upcoming 21-cm interferometric observations to probe interacting dark matter (IDM). We focus on scenarios where the dark matter-baryon scattering cross-section scales as $\sigma(v) =\sigma_{0} v^n$, with $\sigma_{0}$ being the normalization constant, $v$ the relative velocity between dark matter and baryons, and $n$ characterizing the velocity dependence. Specifically, we emphasize two cases: Coulomb-like interaction ($n = -4$) and velocity-independent interaction ($n = 0$). Using detailed simulations of the 21-cm power spectrum and the Fisher matrix formalism, we forecast the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which targets the frequency range 50-225 MHz, to both IDM and astrophysical parameters. We marginalize over key astrophysical uncertainties, including star formation efficiency, ionizing photon escape fraction, and X-ray luminosity. Our results demonstrate that 21-cm power spectrum measurements can significantly improve sensitivity to IDM cross-section, with at least a factor of five improvement over global signal forecasts for the $n=0$ case, and more than an order of magnitude enhancement for the $n=-4$ scenario. These forecasts also significantly improve upon the existing bounds from cosmic microwave background and Milky Way satellite abundance observations. Our analysis also shows that the IDM cross-section exhibits no correlation with the parameters associated with star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction of Population-II stars. However, we find that the Coulomb-like cross-section is positively correlated with X-ray luminosity. Our results highlight the critical role of accounting for astrophysical uncertainties in obtaining robust inferences of dark matter-baryon interactions from future 21-cm power spectrum observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an attempt to derive the binarity rate of samples of 166 A-, F-, G-, and K-type stars from LAMOST DR5 and 1000 randomly selected presumably single stars from Gaia DR3 catalogs. To this end, we compared continua of the observed spectra with the continua of synthetic spectra in the 3700 to 9097 Angstrom range. The latter spectra were reduced to the LAMOST set of wavelengths, while the former ones were smoothed. Next, we searched for every observed star the nearest synthetic spectrum using a four-parameter representation - effective temperature, gravity, [Fe/H], and a range of interstellar absorption values. However, rms deviations of observed spectra from synthetic ones appeared to be not sufficient to claim that any of the stars is a binary. We conclude that comparison of the intensity of pairs of spectral lines remains the best way to detect binarity.</description>

Abstract: We present the first characterization of the Gunn-Peterson trough in high-redshift galaxies using public JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy. This enables us to derive the first galaxy-based IGM opacity measurements at the end of reionisation. Using galaxy spectra has several advantages over quasar spectra: it enables measurements of the IGM opacity in any extragalactic field over a continuous redshift range $4\lesssim z\lesssim 7$, as well as measurements of the intrinsic Lyman-$\beta$ opacity. Our novel constraints are in good agreement with state-of-the-art ground-based quasar Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations, and will become competitive as the number of JWST $z&gt;5$ galaxy spectra rapidly increases. We also provide the first constraints on the uncontaminated Lyman-$\beta$ opacity at $5&lt;z&lt;6$. Finally, we demonstrate the power of JWST to connect the ionisation state of the IGM to the sources of reionisation in a single extragalactic field. We show that a previously reported galaxy overdensity and an excess of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters detected with JWST in GOODS-South at $z=5.8-5.9$ coincides with an anomalously low IGM opacity to Lyman-$\alpha$ at this redshift. The local photo-ionisation rate excess can be fully accounted for by the cumulative ionising output of $M_{\rm{UV}}\lesssim -10$ galaxies in the overdensity, provided they have $\log_{10}\langle \xi_{\rm{ion}} f_{\rm{esc}} / \ [\rm{erg}^{-1}\rm{Hz}]\rangle \simeq 25$ (e.g. $\log_{10}\xi_{\rm{ion}} / \ [\rm{erg}^{-1}\rm{Hz}]=25.4$ and $f_{\rm{esc}}=40\%$). Overall, this breakthrough offers a new way to connect the galaxy large-scale structure to the state of the IGM, potentially enabling us to precisely identify the sources of reionisation.</description>

      <title>The DECam MAGIC Survey: A Wide-field Photometric Metallicity Study of the Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</title>

Abstract: The metallicity distribution function and internal chemical variations of a galaxy are fundamental to understand its formation and assembly history. In this work, we analyze photometric metallicities for 3883 stars over seven half-light radii ($\rm r_h$) in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (Scl dSph) galaxy, using new narrow-band imaging data from the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey conducted with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the 4-m Blanco Telescope. This work demonstrates the scientific potential of MAGIC using the Scl dSph galaxy, one of the most well-studied satellites of the Milky Way. Our sample ranges from $\rm [Fe/H] \approx - 4.0$ to $\rm [Fe/H] \approx - 0.6$, includes six new extremely metal-poor candidates ($\rm [Fe/H] \leq -3.0$), and is almost three times larger than the largest spectroscopic metallicity dataset in the Scl dSph. Our spatially unbiased sample of metallicities provides a more accurate representation of the metallicity distribution function, revealing a more metal-rich peak than observed in the most recent spectroscopic sample. It also reveals a break in the metallicity gradient, with a strong change in the slope: from $-3.26 \pm 0.18 \rm \ dex/deg$ for stars inside $\sim 1\ \rm r_h$ to $-0.55 \pm 0.26 \rm \ dex/deg$ for the outer part of the Scl dSph. Our study demonstrates that combining photometric metallicity analysis with the wide field of view of DECam offers an efficient and unbiased approach for studying the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-AGN scaling relations over 13 billion years in SHARK v2.0 (I): SMBH masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of strong correlations between super-massive black hole (SMBH) masses and galaxy properties like stellar mass have been well-established in the local Universe, but how these scaling relations evolve with cosmic time is yet to be settled in both observations and theoretical models. Recent works have also highlighted the role of galaxy morphology on the scatter of the SMBH-galaxy mass scaling relations, while the impact of other galaxy properties remains poorly studied, like the role of galaxy environment. We use the state-of-the-art SHARK v2.0 semi-analytic model to explore the evolution of these galaxy-SMBH scaling relations to expand the available predictions from theoretical models to contrast with existing and upcoming observations. We find the relations between SMBH masses and both total and bulge stellar mass predicted by SHARK v2.0 to be in good overall agreement with observational measurements across a wide range of redshift and stellar masses. These scaling relations show a significant evolution as a function of cosmic time in SHARK v2.0, with SMBH masses $\sim1$ dex lower at $z=0$ compared to $z=9$ at fixed stellar mass and the scatter increasing by a factor of $\sim2-5$ towards low redshift. Both relations show a strong dependence with galaxy morphology and the main source for SMBH growth (gas accretion or mergers), with weaker trends with star formation rate, galaxy sizes, and environment. We find that galaxy morphology alone explains most of the scatter around both scaling relations, with other galaxy properties tying to the SMBH scaling relations through their correlations with morphology.</description>

      <title>Hiding behind a curtain of dust: Gas and dust properties of an ultra-luminous strongly-lensed z = 3.75 galaxy behind the Milky Way disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of J154506, a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy behind the Lupus-I molecular cloud, and characterisation of its physical properties using a combination of new and archival data, including VLT/MUSE and FORS2 optical data. We identify two high-significance (SNR&gt;5) emission lines at 97.0 and 145.5 GHz, corresponding to CO(4-3) and CO(6-5), respectively in the spectral scans from the Atacama Compact Array and the Large Millimeter Telescope and the [CII] 158~$\mu$m fine-structure line at 400~GHz using the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment. These detections yield a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm{spec}}=3.7515\pm0.0005$. We also report the detection of [CI], HCN(4-3), and two H$_2\rm{O}^+$ transitions, further confirming the redshift and providing insights into J154506's physical properties. By modeling sub-arcsecond resolution (0.75) ALMA Band 6 and 7 continuum data in the uv-plane, we derive an average magnification factor of $6.0\pm0.4$ and our analysis reveals a relatively cold dust (37K) in a starburst ($\sim900~\rm{M}_{\odot}yr^{-1}$) galaxy with a high intrinsic dust mass ($\sim2.5\times10^{9}~\rm{M}_{\odot}$) and infrared (IR) luminosity ($\sim6\times10^{12}~\rm{L}_{\odot}$). The non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer modeling of the joint dust SED and CO line excitation suggests the dust continuum emission is primarily associated with relatively diffuse regions with molecular gas densities of $10^2-10^4\rm{cm}^{-3}$, rather than compact, high-pressure environments typical of extreme starbursts or AGNs. This is supported by the close-to-unity ratio between the dust and gas kinetic temperatures, which argues against highly energetic heating mechanisms. The CO excitation ladder peaks close to CO(5-4) and is dominated by slightly denser molecular gas.</description>

      <title>Blowing Star Formation Away in AGN Hosts (BAH) - IV. Serendipitous discovery of a $z\sim2.9$ star-forming galaxy lensed by the galactic bulge of CGCG 012-070 using JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of a gravitationally lensed galaxy by the nearby spiral galaxy CGCG 012-070 ($z = 0.048$) using Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The lensed galaxy is identified through the flux distributions of emission lines in the rest-frame optical, consistent with a source located at a redshift of $z\sim2.89$. The system is detected in [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$ emission lines, exhibiting line ratios typical of a star-forming galaxy. The emission-line flux distributions reveal three distinct components, which are modeled using an elliptical power-law (EPL) mass profile for the lens galaxy. This model provides a good characterization of the source and reveals a disturbed star-forming morphology consistent with those of galaxies at cosmic noon. This serendipitous discovery of a rare low-redshift strong lens highlights the critical role of IFU observations in expanding the lens census and advancing our understanding of galaxy mass profiles and evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) can form a stable equilibrium configuration, the so-called FDM soliton. In principle, given the FDM particle mass, the profile of the FDM soliton is fixed. In practice, however, there is a great diversity of structures in the Universe. Possible causes of such diversity can lie in such sources as the gravitoelectric field due to a central supermassive black hole, the gravitomagnetic field due to the system angular momentum, an extra denser and compact FDM soliton and an ellipsoidal baryon background. We find that the effects of the gravitomagnetic field due to the soliton's self-angular momentum are very weak while those of the other sources are considerable.</description>

      <title>TiDES: The 4MOST Time Domain Extragalactic Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Time Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES) conducted on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) will perform spectroscopic follow-up of extragalactic transients discovered in the era of the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. TiDES will conduct a 5-year survey, covering ${&gt;}14\,000\,\mathrm{square\, degrees}$, and use around 250 000 fibre hours to address three main science goals: (i) spectroscopic observations of ${&gt;}$30 000 live transients, (ii) comprehensive follow-up of ${&gt;}$200 000 host galaxies to obtain redshift measurements, and (iii) repeat spectroscopic observations of Active Galactic Nuclei to enable reverberation mapping studies. The live spectra from TiDES will be used to reveal the diversity and astrophysics of both normal and exotic supernovae across the luminosity-timescale plane. The extensive host-galaxy redshift campaign will allow exploitation of the larger sample of supernovae and improve photometric classification, providing the largest-ever sample of type Ia supernovae, capable of a sub-2 per cent measurement of the equation-of-state of dark energy. Finally, the TiDES reverberation mapping experiment of 700-1,000 AGN will complement the SN Ia sample and extend the Hubble diagram to $z\sim2.5$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological feedback from a halo assembly perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of feedback from galaxy formation on cosmological probes is typically quantified in terms of the suppression of the matter power spectrum in hydrodynamical compared to gravity-only simulations. In this paper, we instead study how baryonic feedback impacts halo assembly histories and thereby imprints on cosmological observables. We investigate the sensitivity of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ) power spectrum, X-ray number counts, weak lensing and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) stacked profiles to halo populations as a function of mass and redshift. We then study the imprint of different feedback implementations in the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological simulations on the assembly histories of these halo populations, as a function of radial scale. We find that kSZ profiles target lower-mass halos ($M_{200\mathrm{m}}\sim 10^{13.1}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) compared to all other probes considered ($M_{200\mathrm{m}}\sim 10^{15}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$). Feedback is inefficient in high-mass clusters with $\sim 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$, but was more efficient at earlier times in the same population, with a $\sim 5$-$10\%$ effect on mass at $2&lt;z&lt;4$ (depending on radial scale). Conversely, for lower-mass halos with $\sim10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$, feedback exhibits a $\sim5$-$20\%$ effect on mass at $z=0$ but had little impact at earlier times ($z&gt;2$). These findings are tied together by noting that, regardless of redshift, feedback most efficiently redistributes baryons when halos reach a mass of $M_{\rm 200m} \simeq {10^{12.8}}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and ceases to have any significant effect by the time $M_{\rm 200m} \simeq {10^{15}}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We put forward strategies for minimizing sensitivity of lensing analyses to baryonic feedback, and for exploring baryonic resolutions to the unexpectedly low tSZ power in cosmic microwave background observations.</description>

      <title>The physical properties of candidate neutrino-emitter blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The processes governing the production of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos are still debated, and the sources originating them remain an open question. Among the putative emitters, active galactic nuclei have gained increasing attention. Blazars, in particular, stand out due to their ability to accelerate particles in environments with external radiation fields. Recent observations suggest they may contribute to the neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We study the physical properties of a subsample of 52 blazars proposed as candidate neutrino emitters, based on a positional cross-correlation analysis between IceCube hotspots and the 5BZCat catalog. We aim to provide a first characterization of their central engines and physical nature, to explore the potential link with neutrino production. We analyze the optical spectroscopic properties of the 52 candidate neutrino-emitter blazars to infer their accretion regime. The study is complemented by radio and $\gamma$-ray data, which trace the intrinsic jet power. We compare the sample to other blazar populations in the literature, perform statistical tests, and explore, through simulations, the applicability of methods that include censored data. Overall, the target sample shows properties compatible with the reference samples. We observe a mild tendency to prefer objects with intense radiation fields, typical of radiatively efficient accretors, and high radio power. Among them, 24 are detected by Fermi-LAT, spanning various $\gamma$-ray luminosities. We also show that statistical tests commonly used in the literature need to be handled with caution, as they are sensitive to the number of censored data and the sample size.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Intrinsic Galaxy Alignments in Ellipticity Autocorrelations out to $100 h^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}$ from SDSS Galaxies with DESI Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring the autocorrelation of galaxy shapes, known as the intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation, is important for both cosmology and understanding the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. However, such measurements are significantly more challenging than those of the cross-correlation with galaxy density (GI correlation) due to the much lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this Letter, we report the first observational evidence for large-scale intrinsic alignments measured from the ellipticity autocorrelations, extending out to $100\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. From the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, we analyze, over the redshift range $0.16\leq z\leq 0.70$, luminous red galaxy, LOWZ, and CMASS galaxy samples, the latter two of which are crossmatched with high-quality Dark Energy Spectrograph Instrument imaging data. By expanding one of the two II correlation functions, II($-$), in terms of the associated Legendre polynomials, we effectively isolate the line-of-sight projection effects and enhance the signal. The resulting correlation for all three samples exhibits a clear power-law form. We also show that jointly analyzing the two II correlations, II($+$) and II($-$), increases the detection significance by $\sim 10\%$, even though both are derived from the same $E$-mode power spectrum. Importantly, this measurement opens a new observational window for probing signals uniquely encoded in shape autocorrelations, such as tensor perturbations from the gravitational waves. Our analysis establishes a practical framework for extracting such effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dSphs around the Milky Way are commonly considered as systems that are supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravitation. They have been long accounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the GeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or background emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO for the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an original selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we calculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete available samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars, adopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In this way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for general indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out of a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets - DraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII in the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either cored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for other DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO will provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the best targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the still imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint dSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized on a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of targets.</description>
