      <title>MKS 390 Micro-Ion Gauge Performance After Exposure to High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In certain applications, pressure transducers may be exposed to high pressures either deliberately or accidentally, raising concerns about their functionality afterwards. We compared the performance of two MKS Granville-Phillips 390 Micro-Ion Gauges against each other, one that had been exposed to 10,000 Torr and the other had never been exposed to pressures above 1000 Torr. Our results show that the differences in the readings between the gauges were within the range of uncertainty specified by the manufacturer indicating negligible impact due to the exposure to high pressure. Additionally, the high pressure exposure did not compromise the leak integrity of the gauge.</description>

      <title>The IDEA detector concept for FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron-positron stage of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) provides exciting opportunities that are enabled by next generation particle physics detectors. This contribution presents IDEA, a detector concept optimised for FCC-ee and composed of a vertex detector based on MAPS, a very light drift chamber, a silicon wrapper, a high resolution dual-readout crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, an HTS based superconducting solenoid, a dual-readout fibre calorimeter, and three layers of muon chambers embedded in the magnet flux return yoke. In particular, the physics requirements and the technical solutions chosen in the various sub-systems to address them are discussed. This is followed by a description of the detector R&amp;D currently in progress, test-beam results, and the expected performance on some key physics benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the H2M Monolithic CMOS Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The H2M (Hybrid-to-Monolithic) is a monolithic pixel sensor manufactured in a modified \SI{65}{\nano\meter}~CMOS imaging process with a small collection electrode. Its design addresses the challenges of porting an existing hybrid pixel detector architecture into a monolithic chip, using a digital-on-top design methodology, and developing a compact digital cell library. Each square pixel integrates an analog front-end and digital pulse processing with an 8-bit counter within a \SI{35}{\micro\meter}~pitch.
  This contribution presents the performance of H2M based on laboratory and test beam measurements, including a comparison with analog front-end simulations in terms of gain and noise. A particular emphasis is placed on backside thinning in order to reduce material budget, down to a total chip thickness of \SI{21}{\micro\meter} for which no degradation in MIP detection performance is observed. For all investigated samples, a MIP detection efficiency above \SI{99}{\%} is achieved below a threshold of approximately 205 electrons. At this threshold, the fake-hit rate corresponds to a matrix occupancy of fewer than one pixel per the \SI{500}{\nano\second}~frame.
  Measurements reveal a non-uniform in-pixel response, attributed to the formation of local potential wells in regions with low electric field. A simulation flow combining technology computer-aided design, Monte Carlo, and circuit simulations is used to investigate and describe this behavior, and is applied to develop mitigation strategies for future chip submissions with similar features.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Resolution in Pink Beam Dark Field X-ray Microscopy: Experiments and Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pink-beam Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy (pDFXM) is a powerful emerging technique for time-resolved studies of microstructure and strain evolution in bulk crystalline materials. In this work, we systematically assess the performance of pDFXM relative to monochromatic DFXM when using a compound refractive lens (CRL) as the objective. Analytical expressions for the spatial and angular resolution are derived and compared with numerical simulations based on geometrical optics and experimental data. The pink-beam configuration provides an increased diffraction intensity depending on the deformation state of the sample, accompanied by a general tenfold degradation in angular resolution along the rocking and longitudinal directions. This trade-off is disadvantageous for axial strain mapping, but can be advantageous in cases where integrated intensities are needed. For a perfect crystal under parallel illumination with a pink beam, our results show that chromatic aberration is absent, whereas under condensed illumination it becomes significant. The aberration is shown to depend strongly on the local distortion of the crystal. Weak-beam imaging conditions, such as those required for resolving dislocations, are shown to remain feasible under pink-beam operation and may even provide an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The higher incident flux, enhanced by nearly two orders of magnitude, is quantified in terms of beam heating effects, and implications for optimized scanning protocols are discussed.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale optimal control for Einstein Telescope active seismic isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale optimal control framework for active seismic isolation in the Einstein Telescope, a third-generation gravitational-wave observatory. Our approach jointly optimizes feedback and blending filters in a cross-coupled opto-mechanical system using a unified cost function based on the "acausal optimum," which quantifies sensor signal-to-noise ratios across frequencies. This method enables efficient re-optimization under varying sensor configurations and environmental conditions. We apply the framework to two candidate sensing systems using their modeled sensitivity: OmniSens-a six-degree-of-freedom inertial isolation system-and BRS-T360, which combines Beam Rotation Sensor (BRS) as an inertial tilt sensor with T360 as a horizontal seismometer. We demonstrate superior low-frequency isolation with OmniSens, reducing platform motion by up to two orders of magnitude near the microseism. The framework allows for ready optimization and projection of sensor noise to metrics relevant to the performance of the instrument, aiding the design of the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Particle Identification in Helium-Based Drift Chambers Using Cluster Counting Insights from Beam Test Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle identification in gaseous detectors traditionally relies on energy loss measurements (dE/dx); however, uncertainties in total energy deposition limit its resolution. The cluster counting technique (dN/dx) offers an alternative approach by exploiting the Poisson-distributed nature of primary ionization, providing a statistically robust method for mass determination. Simulation studies with Garfield++ and Geant4 indicate that dN/dx can achieve twice the resolution of dE/dx in helium-based drift chambers. However, experimental implementation is challenging due to signal overlap in the time domain, complicating the identification of electron peaks and ionization clusters. This paper presents novel algorithms and modern computational techniques to address these challenges, facilitating accurate cluster recognition in experimental data. The effectiveness of these algorithms is validated through four beam tests conducted at CERN, utilizing various helium gas mixtures, gas gains, and wire orientations relative to ionizing tracks. The experiments employ a muon beam (1 GeV/c to 180 GeV/c) with drift tubes of different sizes and sense wire diameters. The analysis explores the Poisson nature of cluster formation, evaluates the performance of different clustering algorithms, and examines the dependence of counting efficiency on the beam particle impact parameter. Furthermore, a comparative study of the resolution achieved using dN/dx and dE/dx is presented.</description>

      <title>Doping of a Borexino-like Liquid Scintillator with Tellurium-Diols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most promising approaches for future neutrinoless double beta decay searches is to incorporate a candidate isotope into the liquid scintillator of a next-generation neutrino detector. In this study, a sample of the high-performance 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene-based liquid scintillator from the Borexino detector was loaded with different concentrations of Te-diols. Therefore,a novel and completely water-free synthesis in a non-acidic organic environment at room temperature was used. Key parameters of the loaded samples were analyzed and compared with those of the pure Borexino liquid. Both the emission spectrum and transmission remained nearly unchanged,even at high doping levels. The reduction in light yield was moderate, with approximately 8,400 photons emitted for a 1 MeV energy deposition by an electron at 1$\%$ tellurium loading. The time profile of the light emission induced by alpha particles was also investigated, revealing that the scintillation response becomes significantly faster with increasing tellurium concentration.</description>

      <title>Developing a Cost-Effective Spectrometer: A Practical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06703v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper demonstrates the design and execution of a low-cost optical spectrometer that employs a webcam, diffraction grating &amp; Python (a free, open-source programming language). The device's design prioritized economy and usability, with a black box casing to reduce stray light and increase measurement accuracy. A diffraction grating made from a DVD was used to split light into its constituent wavelengths, which were then collected by the camera. The calibration procedure used a RED TIDE USB650 Fiber Optic Spectrometer to set calibration values for various wavelength ranges, which ensured that the spectrometer's results closely matched those derived from the former, a high-cost industry-standard model. Spectrums of several light sources, such as red, green, blue, yellow, white, magenta, orange, and UV LEDs, as well as a green laser, were studied and compared. The results showed a high level of precision, with minimal divergence from industry-standard spectrometer measurements. This comparison was carried out utilizing Origin software, which allowed for extensive analysis and display of the spectrum data. In addition, the spectrometer captured data in real time, allowing users to watch live spectrum changes and ensure instant accessibility of results. Despite its simplicity and low cost, the spectrometer provides significant value for instructional and practical applications, making it a valuable tool in cost-constrained situations.</description>
