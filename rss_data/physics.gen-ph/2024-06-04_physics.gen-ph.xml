      <title>Group-theoretical classification of orientable objects and particle phenomenology</title>

Abstract: In our previous works, we have proposed a quantum description of relativistic orientable objects by a scalar field on the Poincar\'{e} group. This description is, in a sense, a generalization of ideas used by Wigner, Casimir and Eckart back in the 1930's in constructing a non-relativistic theory of a rigid rotator. The present work is a continuation and development of the above mentioned our works. The position of the relativistic orientable object in Minkowski space is completely determined by the position of a body-fixed reference frame with respect to the space-fixed reference frame, and can be specified by elements $q$ of the motion group of the Minkowski space - the Poincar\'e group $M(3,1)$. Quantum states of relativistic orientable objects are described by scalar wave functions $f(q)$ where the arguments $q=(x,z)$ consist of Minkowski space-time points $x$, and of orientation variables $z$ given by elements of the matrix $Z\in SL(2,C)$. Technically, we introduce and study the so-called double-sided representation $\boldsymbol{T}(\boldsymbol{g})f(q)=f(g_l^{-1}qg_r)$, $\boldsymbol{g}=(g_l,g_r)\in \boldsymbol{M}$, of the group $\boldsymbol{M}$, in the space of the scalar functions $f(q)$. Here the left multiplication by $g_l^{-1}$ corresponds to a change of space-fixed reference frame, whereas the right multiplication by $g_r$ corresponds to a change of body-fixed reference frame. On this basis, we develop a classification of the orientable objects and draw the attention to a possibility of connecting these results with the particle phenomenology. In particular, we demonstrate how one may identify fields described by linear and quadratic functions of $z$ with known elementary particles of spins $0$,$\frac{1}{2}$, and $1$. The developed classification does not contradict the phenomenology of elementary particles and, moreover, in some cases give its group-theoretic explanation.</description>

      <title>Synchronizing Rhythms of Logic</title>

Abstract: Although quantum states nicely express interference effects, outcomes of experimental trials show no states directly; they indicate properties of probability distributions for outcomes. Twenty years ago we proved categorically that probability distributions leave open a choice of quantum states and operators and particles, resolvable only by a move beyond logic, which, inspired or not, can be characterized as a guess. Guesses link the inner lives of investigators to their explanations that objectively accord with measured data. Recognizing the inescapability of guesswork in physics leads to avenues of investigation, an example of which is this paper.
  We display a physical foundation of logic and calculation, representing this foundation mathematically, so as to show the shaping and re-shaping of calculation by guesswork. We draw on the interplay between guessing and computation as it works in digital contexts that include living organisms. Digital computation and communication depend on a type of synchronization that coordinates transitions among physically distinct conditions that express "digits." This logical synchronization, known to engineers but neglected in physics, requires guesswork for its maintenance. By abstracting digital hardware, we model the structure of human thinking as logically synchronized computation, punctuated by guesses.
  We adapt marked graphs to mathematically represent computation, and we represent guesses by unpredictable changes in the marked graphs. The marked graphs reveal a logical structure of spatial and temporal navigation, with implications across physics and its applications to biology. By limiting our model to the logical aspect of communications and computations, we display structure in relation to guesswork, applicable not just in electronics but also to the functioning of living organisms.</description>
