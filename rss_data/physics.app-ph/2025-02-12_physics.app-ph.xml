      <title>A physical model approach to order lot sizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing need for companies to reduce costs and maximize profits has led to an increased focus on logistics activities. Among these, inventory management plays a crucial role in minimizing organizational expenses by optimizing the storage and transportation of materials. In this context, this study introduces an optimization model for the lot-sizing problem based on a physical system approach. By establishing that the material supply problem is isomorphic to a one-dimensional mechanical system of point particles connected by elastic elements, we leverage this analogy to derive cost optimization conditions naturally and obtain an exact solution. This approach determines lot sizes that minimize the combined ordering and inventory holding costs in a significantly shorter time, eliminating the need for heuristic methods. The optimal lot sizes are defined in terms of the parameter $ \gamma = 2C_O / C_H $, which represents the relationship between the ordering cost per order ($ C_O $) and the holding cost per period for the material required in one period ($ C_H $). This parameter fully dictates the system's behavior: when $ \gamma \leq 1 $, the optimal strategy is to place one order per period, whereas for $ \gamma &gt; 1 $, the number of orders $ N $ is reduced relative to the planning horizon $ M $, meaning $ N &lt; M $. By formulating the total cost function in terms of the intensive variable $ N/M $, we consolidate the entire optimization problem into a single function of $ \gamma $. This eliminates the need for complex algorithms, enabling faster and more precise purchasing decisions. The proposed model was validated through a real-world case study and benchmarked against classical algorithms, demonstrating superior cost optimization and reduced execution time. These findings underscore the potential of this approach for improving material lot-sizing strategies.</description>

      <title>Fingerprint Matrix Concept for Detecting, Localizing and Characterizing Targets in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As waves propagate through a complex medium, they undergo multiple scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to imaging, as it causes a full blurring of the image beyond a transport mean free path. Here, we show how to detect, localize, and characterize any scattering target through the reflection matrix of the complex medium in which this target is embedded and thus hidden from direct view. More precisely, we introduce a fingerprint operator that contains the specific signature of the target with respect to its environment. Applied to the recorded reflection matrix, this operator provides a likelihood index of the target in any given state, despite the scattering fog induced by the surrounding environment. This state can be the target position for localization purposes, its shape for characterization, or any other parameter that influences the target response. Our concept is versatile and broadly applicable to different type of waves for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured. We demonstrate this here explicitly by performing different proof-of-concept experiments with ultrasound on targets buried inside a strongly scattering granular suspension, on lesion markers for clinical applications, and on the architecture of muscle tissue.</description>

      <title>Total acoustic transmission between fluids using a solid material with emphasis on the air-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total acoustic transmission between water and air is modeled using a purely solid interface comprising two elastic plates separated by periodically spaced ribs. The frequency of full transmission depends only on, and is inversely proportional to, the areal density of the plate facing the air. Total transmission also requires a specific dependence of the rib spacing on the bending stiffness of the two plates. These relations are the result of an explicit analytical solution for the transmitted and reflected acoustic waves combined with asymptotic approximations based on the small parameter defined by the air-to-water impedance ratio. Surprisingly, the total transmission effect is almost independent of the angle of incidence, even though the transmission conditions are predicated on normal incidence. Parametric studies are performed to examine the effect on the frequency bandwidth and Q-factor of the acoustic transmissivity. A lower bound for the Q-factor of $30.6$ is simply related to the water-air impedance ratio.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Shear Horizontal Acoustic and Plasma Waves in Hexagonal Piezoelectric Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study coupled acoustic and plasma waves in piezoelectric semiconductor crystals of hexagonal symmetry. We focus on the so called shear-horizontal or antiplane motions with one mechanical displacement. A set of two dimensional equations is reduced from the three-dimensional equations. Since the material is effectively isotropic in the two dimensional plane under consideration, the equations are relatively simple. Dispersion curves of coupled elastic and acoustic waves are obtained analytically and examined numerically along with the effects of some parameters.</description>

      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in coherently strained AlN/GaN/AlN quantum wells on bulk AlN substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in coherently strained, low-dislocation AlN/GaN/AlN quantum wells (QWs), including both undoped and $\delta$-doped structures. SdH measurements reveal a single subband occupation in the undoped GaN QW and two subband occupation in the $\delta$-doped GaN QW. More importantly, SdH oscillations enable direct measurement of critical two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) parameters at the Fermi level: carrier density and ground state energy level, electron effective mass ($m^* \approx 0.289\,m_{\rm e}$ for undoped GaN QW and $m^* \approx 0.298\,m_{\rm e}$ for $\delta$-doped GaN QW), and quantum scattering time ($\tau_{\rm q} \approx 83.4 \, \text{fs}$ for undoped GaN QW and $\tau_{\rm q} \approx 130.6 \, \text{fs}$ for $\delta$-doped GaN QW). These findings provide important insights into the fundamental properties of 2DEGs that are strongly quantum confined in the thin GaN QWs, essential for designing nitride heterostructures for high-performance electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Virtual Critical Coupling in High-Power Resonant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciting high-power resonators pose challenges such as managing power reflections, which can cause energy losses and damage system components. This is crucial for applications like Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) systems in tokamaks, where plasma stability and confinement depend on efficient energy transfer. In this work, we introduce the Virtual Critical Coupling mechanism to address reflection-related challenges in S-band resonators. We theoretically designed a complex frequency excitation signal tailored to the resonator's characteristics, facilitating efficient energy storage and minimizing reflections without mechanical modifications. Using a custom low-level RF system, we conducted experiments at 32 mW and 600 kW with a 5 MW S-band klystron, demonstrating a ninefold reduction in reflection coefficients compared to traditional monochromatic excitation in high-power tests. This approach enhances the efficiency and stability of high-power resonant systems, potentially advancing nuclear fusion energy production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A robust and efficient model for investigating the ultrafast dynamics of magnetic materials excited by laser pulses has been created, integrating dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equations with a quantum thermostat and a two-temperature model. The model has been successfully applied to three archetypal materials in the literature: nickel, cobalt, and iron. Additionally, analysis of the ultrafast dynamic susceptibility tensor indicates that off-diagonal components display specific features depending on whether a continuous external magnetic field is present.</description>

      <title>Broadband light extraction from near-surface NV centers using crystalline-silicon antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~17 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~9 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>Integrated electronic controller for dynamic self-configuration of photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) can implement arbitrary operations and signal processing functionalities directly in the optical domain. Run-time configuration of these circuits requires an electronic control layer to adjust the working point of their building elements and make them compensate for thermal drifts or degradations of the input signal. As the advancement of photonic foundries enables the fabrication of chips of increasing complexity, developing scalable electronic controllers becomes crucial for the operation of complex PICs. In this paper, we present an electronic application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for reconfiguration of PICs featuring numerous tuneable elements. Each channel of the ASIC controller independently addresses one optical component of the PIC, as multiple parallel local feedback loops are operated to achieve full control. The proposed design is validated through real-time reconfiguration of a 16-channel silicon photonics adaptive beam coupler. Results demonstrate automatic coupling of an arbitrary input beam to a single-mode waveguide, dynamic compensation of beam wavefront distortions and successful transmission of a 50 Gbit/s signal through an optical free-space link. The low power consumption and compactness of the electronic chip provide a scalable paradigm that can be seamlessly extended to larger photonic architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision sensors are of fundamental importance in modern society and technology.Although numerous sensors have been developed, obtaining sensors with higher levels of sensitivity and stronger robustness has always been expected. Here, we propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a novel class of sensors with superior performances based on exotic properties of highorder non-Hermitian topological physics. The frequency shift induced by perturbations for these sensors can show an exponential growth with respect to the size of the device, which can well beyond the limitations of conventional sensors. The fully integrated circuit chips have been designed and fabricated in a standard 65nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology. The sensitivity of systems not only less than 0.001fF has been experimentally verified, they are also robust against disorders.Our proposed ultra-sensitive integrated circuit sensors can possess a wide range of applications in various fields and show an exciting prospect for next-generation sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>On Measures in Ion Trap Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate quantum information measures in ion traps by utilizing the harmonic oscillator model to characterize trapped potentials and ion dynamics. Our findings confirm that, in the steady-state case, mutual information and synchronization measures exhibit similar behaviors. Additionally, we explore how these measures change in the quench model and how they are influenced by coupling and external noise, such as an external magnetic field. Moreover, for a proposed target ground state, we determine the circuit depth and analyze the effects of the external magnetic field and coupling constant, highlighting their dynamic evolution over time. We also discuss the coherent state of a single ion in a trap, noting an inverse relationship between complexity and fidelity-where increased fidelity corresponds to decreased system complexity, indicating a more ordered state with improved control and optimization. However, at higher system frequencies, complexity increases due to intricate interactions and rapid state changes, necessitating advanced control mechanisms.</description>
