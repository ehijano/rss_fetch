      <title>Minimal Product Set in Non-Abelian Metacyclic Groups of Even Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ and positive integers $r$ and $s$, a problem of interest in algebra is determining the minimum cardinality of the product set $AB$, where $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $G$ such that $|A|=r$ and $|B|=s$. This problem has been solved for the class of abelian groups; however, it remains open for finite non-abelian groups. In this paper, we prove that the result obtained for abelian groups can be extended to the class of metacyclic groups $K_{m,n}=\left\langle a,b \ : \ a^m=1,b^{2n}=a^g,bab^{-1}=a^{-1}\right\rangle$. Consequently, we provide a new proof of the result for the dihedral group $D_n$ and dicylic group $Q_{4n}$.</description>

      <title>The maximal rank of a string group generated by involutions for alternating groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A string group generated by involutions, or SGGI, is a pair $\Gamma=(G, S)$, where $G$ is a group and $S=\{\rho_0,\ldots, \rho_{r-1}\}$ is an ordered set of involutions generating $G$ and satisfying the commuting property: $$\forall i,j\in\{0,\ldots, r-1\}, \;|i-j|\ne 1\Rightarrow (\rho_i\rho_j)^2=1.$$ When $S$ is an independent set, the rank of $\Gamma$ is the cardinality of $S$.
  We determine an upper bound for the rank of an SGGI over the alternating group of degree $n$. Our bound is tight when $n\equiv 0,1,4\pmod 5$.</description>

      <title>Beyond graph products and cactus groups: quandle products of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and initiate the study of quandle products of groups, a family of groups that includes graph products of groups, cactus groups, wreath products, and the recently introduced trickle groups. Our approach is geometric: we show that quandle products admit quasi-median Cayley graphs; and, then, we exploit this geometry to deduce various valuable information about quandle products.</description>

      <title>Solvable, nilpotent and supernilpotent semigroups with completely simple ideal and monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around 1980 commutator theory was generalized from groups to arbitrary algebras using the socalled term condition commutator. The semigroups that are abelian with respect to this commutator were classified by Warne (1994). We study what solvability, nilpotence, and supernilpotence in the sense of commutator theory mean for semigroups and how these notions relate to classical concepts in semigroup theory. We show that a semigroup with a completely simple ideal is solvable (left nilpotent or right nilpotent or supernilpotent) in the sense of commutator theory iff it is a nilpotent extension in the classical sense of semigroup theory of a completely simple semigroup with solvable (nilpotent) subgroups. These characterizations hold in particular for finite semigroups and for eventually regular semigroups, i.e., semigroups in which every element has some regular power.
  We also show that a monoid is (left and right) nilpotent in the sense of commutator theory iff it embeds into a nilpotent group.</description>

      <title>Proper actions on finite products of proper Gromov-hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ is said to have property (PPH) if there exist finitely many proper Gromov-hyperbolic spaces $X_1,\ldots, X_l$ on which $G$ acts cocompactly such that the diagonal action $G\curvearrowright \prod_{i=1}^lX_i$ with $\ell^1$-metric is proper. Such groups include hyperbolic groups, Coxeter groups, solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups, BMW groups and their finite direct products. In the first part of this paper, we show that the class of finitely generated subgroups in groups having property (PPH) satisfies the weak Tits Alternative and a large subclass satisfies both the strong Tits Alternative and the Girth Alternative. Furthermore, we show that the dimension of the second bounded cohomology of a non-amenable group as a finitely generated subgroup of groups having property (PPH) is infinite.
  In the second part of this paper, we show that the set of simultaneously contracting elements in a group acting on finitely many metric spaces with contracting property contains an infinite independent subset. Furthermore, we show that the set of simultaneously hyperbolic elements in a group acting non-elliptically and non-horocyclically on finitely many proper Gromov-hyperbolic spaces has positive density with respect to any proper word metric.</description>

      <title>The modular automorphisms of quotient modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the modular automorphism group of any quotient modular curve of level $N$, with $4,9\nmid N$. In particular, we obtain some non-expected automorphisms of order 3 that appear for the quotient modular curves when the Atkin-Lehner involution $w_{25}$ belongs to the quotient modular group, such automorphisms are not necessarily defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. As a consequence of the results, we obtain the full automorphism group of the quotient modular curve $X_0^*(N^2)$, for sufficiently large $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every ordered partial action of an inverse semigroupoid on a partially ordered set admits a globalization. This result is used to establish a connection between ordered partial actions of groupoids and a multi-object analogue of McAlister triples. As a consequence, we obtain a multi-object version of the P-theorem: every E-unitary inverse semigroupoid is isomorphic to a semidirect product arising from an ordered partial action of a groupoid on a multi-object version of a semilattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on the study of cut groups, i.e., the groups which have only trivial central units in their integral group ring. We provide state of art for cut groups. The results are compiled in a systematic manner and have also been analogously studied for some generalised classes, such as quadratic rational groups and semi-rational groups etc. For these bigger classes, some results have been extended, while others have been posed as questions. The progress and the problems signify the development and the potential that holds in the topic of cut groups and its generalisations.</description>

      <title>Regular 3-polytopes of type $\{n,n\}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each integer \( n \geq 3 \), we construct a self-dual regular 3-polytope \( \mathcal{P} \) of type \( \{n, n\} \) with \( 2^n n \) flags, resolving two foundamental open questions on the existence of regular polytopes with certain Schl\"afli types. The automorphism group \( \operatorname{Aut}(\mathcal{P}) \) is explicitly realized as the semidirect product \( \mathbb{F}_2^{n-1} \rtimes D_{2n} \), where \( D_{2n} \) is the dihedral group of order \( 2n \), with a complete presentation for \( \operatorname{Aut}(\mathcal{P}) \) is provided. This advances the systematic construction of regular polytopes with prescribed symmetries.</description>

      <title>Finite $p$-groups of class $2$ as central extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.10970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite $p$-groups of nilpotency class 2 are treated from the perspective of central extension.
  Given finite abelian groups $G,A$, we derive an explicit formula for cocycles representing elements of $H^2(G,A)$, compute $H^2(G,A)$, and describe the actions of ${\rm End}(G)$ and ${\rm End}(A)$ on $H^2(G,A)$. These are used to provide an efficient criterion for lifting endomorphisms of $G$ to homomorphisms between two central extensions. Subsequently, we present two applications to illustrate the usefulness, in the case $p&gt;2$.
  First, we recover the classification of two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$ up to isomorphism, and compute the order of the automorphism group for each isomorphism class. Second, we construct a family of non-abelian $p$-groups of order $p^7$ whose automorphism groups are abelian.</description>

      <title>Root graded groups of type $ H_3 $ and $ H_4 $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the well-known realisation of the root system $ H_4 $ as a folding of $ E_8 $, one can construct examples of $ H_4 $-graded groups from Chevalley groups of type $ E_8 $. Such Chevalley groups are defined over a commutative ring $ R $, and the root groups of the resulting $ H_4 $-grading are coordinatised by $ R \times R $. We show that every $ H_4 $-graded group arises as the folding of an $ E_8 $-graded group, or in other words, that it is coordinatised by $ R \times R $ for some commutative ring $ R $. We also prove similar assertions for $ (D_6, H_3) $ in place of $ (E_8, H_4) $.</description>

      <title>Limit Profiles for Reversible Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.13437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Teyssier [Tey20] introduced a new method for approximating the distance from equilibrium of a random walk on a group. He used it to study the limit profile for the random transpositions card shuffle. His techniques were restricted to conjugacy-invariant random walks on groups; we derive similar approximation lemmas for random walks on homogeneous spaces and for general reversible Markov chains. We illustrate applications of these lemmas to some famous problems: the $k$-cycle shuffle, improving results of Hough [Hou16] and Berestycki, Schramm and Zeitouni [BSZ11]; the Ehrenfest urn diffusion with many urns, improving results of Ceccherini-Silberstein, Scarabotti and Tolli [CST07]; a Gibbs sampler, which is a fundamental tool in statistical physics, with Binomial prior and hypergeometric posterior, improving results of Diaconis, Khare and Saloff-Coste [DKS08].</description>

      <title>Equivalences of racks, Legendrian racks, and symmetric racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Racks and Legendrian racks are nonassociative algebraic structures based on the framed and Legendrian Reidemeister moves, respectively. Motivated by the classification problem for Legendrian knots, we construct an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks (and, hence, GL-quandles). We deduce equivalences between kink-involutory racks and Legendrian quandles, involutory racks and Legendrian kei, and the respective pairs of full subcategories whose objects are medial.
  As applications, we classify objects in these categories up to order 8 and classify several families of symmetric racks; these results are likely to be of independent interest. In particular, the categories of kei with good involutions, Legendrian kei, and involutory racks are all equivalent.</description>
