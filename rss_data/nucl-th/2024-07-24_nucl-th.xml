      <title>Bulk Viscosity in Dense Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, I describe bulk viscosity as a general concept, and then focus on bulk viscosity in the dense matter present in compact objects. While this review is focused on bulk viscosity in the conditions present in neutron star mergers, I present a history of bulk viscosity research in dense matter, from its role in damping radial oscillations in neutron stars through its current applications in neutron star mergers. The majority of the chapter consists of calculations of the bulk viscosity from Urca processes in generic neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter, and then in dense matter containing muons ($npe\mu$ matter) as well. I make several approximations in these calculations to keep the focus on the concepts. More precise calculations exist in the literature, to which I refer the reader. One concept I attempt to elucidate is the thermodynamic behavior of a fluid element throughout an oscillation and how that leads to bulk-viscous dissipation. I conclude with a discussion of the recent research into the role of weak interactions and bulk viscosity in neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Equation of state of nuclear matter from collective flows and stopping in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state of nuclear matter, momentum dependence of the effective interaction and in-medium modification of elastic nucleon-nucleon cross-sections are studied by comparing theoretical predictions for stopping, directed and elliptic flows of protons and light clusters in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions of beam energy between 150 and 800 MeV/nucleon to experimental data gathered by the FOPI Collaboration. A multivariate analysis that takes into account systematic uncertainties induced on model predictions by the coalescence afterburner leads to the following constraint for the equation of state at 68 percent confidence level: compressibility modulus of isospin symmetric matter $K_0=230^{+9}_{-11}$ MeV and slope of the symmetry energy $L=63^{+10}_{-13}$ MeV. The momentum dependence of the isoscalar potential is found to be similar to that of the empirical optical potential, with an effective isoscalar mass $m^*=0.695^{+0.014}_{-0.018}$. The isovector potential displays a momentum dependence corresponding to a positive neutron-proton effective mass difference $\Delta m^*_{np}=(0.17^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\delta$, close to the world average for this quantity. A suppression of elastic nucleon-nucleon cross-sections in symmetric nuclear matter at saturation by about 60$\%$ relative to vacuum values is deduced, in qualitative agreement with microscopical results. A strong dependence of the suppression factor on isospin asymmetry is evidenced, experimental data for isospin symmetric systems proving crucial for this last conclusion.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in N = 40, 60 and 90 nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on three mass regions where first-order phase transitions occur, namely for $N=40$, 60 and 90. We investigate four isotopic chains (Se, Zr, Mo and Nd) in the framework of microscopic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock + Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer calculations for 15 different parametrizations. The microscopic calculations show the typical behavior expected for first-order phase transitions. To find the best candidate for the critical point phase transition we propose new microscopic position and occupation indices calculated for positive-parity and negative-parity proton and neutron single-quasiparticle states around the Fermi level. The microscopic calculations are completed by macroscopic calculations within the Algebraic Collective Model (ACM), and compared to the experimental data for $^{74}$Se, $^{102}$Mo and $^{150}$Nd, considered to be the best candidates for the critical point nuclei.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Variables: Harnessing Half-Shell Potentials for Enhanced Precision in Nuclear Reaction Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of half-shell components on nuclear reaction calculations, focusing on nonelastic breakup cross sections within the Ichimura-Austern-Vincent (IAV) model. By advocating for the use of a consistent Single Folding Model (SFM) for all optical potentials in IAV calculations, we aim to reduce the uncertainties associated with half-shell components and enhance agreement with experimental data. We present results from deuteron-induced reactions on $^{60}$Ni and $^{208}$Pb, which serve as surrogate targets for neutron-induced reactions on short-lived nuclei. The application of consistent optical potentials derived from the SFM shows improved alignment with experimental data compared to traditional global phenomenological potentials. Furthermore, we investigate the $^{59}$Co($^6$Li,$\alpha X$) reaction, which reveals that the half-shell $T$-matrix plays a pivotal role in accurately modeling nuclear reactions. Our findings suggest that a unified approach to optical potentials, accounting for half-shell effects, is critical for a precise understanding of complex nuclear reactions. This work highlights the significance of the internal dynamics of the wave function, particularly in lighter targets, and underscores the importance of the half-shell $T$-matrix as a previously underappreciated variable in reaction calculations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Intensity Interferometry in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important tool in studying the sub-femtoscale spacetime structure of matter in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) intensity interferometry of identical particles in the final state of such collisions. We show here that a variant of an entanglement enabled intensity interferometry ($E^2 I^2$) proposed by Cotler and Wilczek provides a powerful alternative to HBT interferometry in extracting fundamental nonperturbative features of QCD at high energies. In particular, we show that the spatial distributions of color singlet (pomeron) configurations in nuclei can be obtained from exclusive resonant decays of $\rho$-mesons into $\pi^\pm$-pairs in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions (UPCs) at RHIC and the LHC. The $E^2 I^2$ framework developed here is quite general. It can be employed to extract information on the spin structure of pomeron couplings as well as enhance the discovery potential for rare odderon configurations from exclusive vector meson decays into few-particle final states both in UPCs and at the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>The CSS Hamiltonian: high energy evolution of rapidity dependent observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider evolution of observables which depend on a small but fixed value of longitudinal momentum fraction $x$, to high rapidity, such that $\eta&gt;\ln 1/x$. We show that this evolution is not given by the JIMWLK (or BK) equation. We derive the evolution Hamiltonian - $H_{CSS-JIMWLK}$ which generates this evolution in the cases of dilute and dense projectile wave function. The two limits yield identical results for $H_{CSS-JIMWLK}$. We show that the resulting evolution for the gluon TMD is identical to the (double logarithmic) perturbative Collins-Soper-Sterman evolution equation in the longitudinal resolution parameter at a fixed and very large transverse resolution.</description>

      <title>COLOSS: Complex-scaled Optical and couLOmb Scattering Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce COLOSS, a program designed to address the scattering problem using a bound-state technique known as complex scaling. In this method, the oscillatory boundary conditions of the wave function are transformed into exponentially decaying ones, accommodating the long-range Coulomb interaction. The program implements the Woods-Saxon form of a realistic optical potential, with all potential parameters included in a well-designed input format for ease of use. This design offers users straightforward access to compute \(S\)-matrices and cross-sections of the scattering process. We provide thorough discussions on the precision of Lagrange functions and their benefits in evaluating matrix elements. Additionally, COLOSS incorporates two distinct rotation methods, making it adaptable to potentials without analytical expressions. Comparative results demonstrate that COLOSS achieves high accuracy when compared with the direct integration method, Numerov, underscoring its utility and effectiveness in scattering calculations.</description>

      <title>The $\omega$-meson from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many excited states in the hadron spectrum have large branching ratios to the three-hadron final states. Understanding such particles from first principles QCD requires input from lattice QCD with one-, two-, and three-meson interpolators as well as a reliable three-body formalism relating finite-volume spectra at unphysical pion masses to the scattering amplitudes at the physical point. In this work, we provide the first-ever calculation of the resonance parameters of the $\omega$-meson from lattice QCD to the physical point, including an update of the formalism through matching to effective field theories. The main result of this pioneering study, the pole position of the $\omega$-meson at $\sqrt{s_\omega}= (778.0(11.2)-i\,3.0(5) )\,\mathrm{MeV}$, agrees reasonably well with experiment providing a pathway to study heavier three-hadron resonances. In addition we provide an estimate of the $\omega-\rho$ mass difference as $29(15)\,\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Joint Inference of Population, Cosmology, and Neutron Star Equation of State from Gravitational Waves of Dark Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) are expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) emissions, which help to identify the host galaxy. Since GW events directly measure their luminosity distances, joint GW-EM observations from BNSs help to study cosmology, particularly the Hubble constant, unaffected by cosmic distance ladder systematics. However, detecting EM counterparts from BNS mergers is not always possible. Additionally, the tidal deformations of BNS components offer insights into the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS). In such cases, the tidal parameters of NSs, combined with the knowledge of the NS EoS, can break the degeneracy between mass parameters and redshift, allowing for the inference of the Hubble constant. Several efforts have aimed to infer the Hubble constant using the tidal parameters of BNSs, without EM counterparts, termed dark BNSs. Moreover, some studies have focused on the joint estimation of population and NS EoS for unbiased NS EoS estimation. However, none of the works consistently combined the uncertainties of population, cosmology, and NS EoS within a Bayesian framework. In this study, we propose a novel Bayesian analysis to jointly constrain the NS EoS, population, and cosmological parameters using a population of dark BNSs detected through GW observations. This method can well constrain the Hubble constant with as few as $5$ BNS observations using current-generation detectors. This level of precision is unattainable without incorporating the NS EoS, especially when observing BNS mergers without EM counterpart information.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of the dense matter equation of state built upon extended Skyrme interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-relativistic model of nuclear matter with Brussels extended Skyrme interactions is employed in order to build, within a Bayesian approach, models for the dense matter equation of state (EOS). In addition to a minimal set of constraints on nuclear empirical parameters; the density behavior of the energy per particle in pure neutron matter (PNM); a lower limit on the maximum neutron star (NS) mass, we require that the Fermi velocity of neutrons ($v_{\mathrm{F;\,n}}$) in PNM and symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) with densities up to $0.8~\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ (arbitrary) does not exceed the speed of light. The latter condition is imposed in order to cure a deficiency present in many Skyrme interactions [Duan and Urban, Phys. Rev. C 108, 025813 (2023)]. We illustrate the importance of this constraint for the posterior distributions. Some of our models are subjected to constraints on the density dependence of neutron (nucleon) Landau effective mass in PNM (SNM), too. The impact of various sets of constraints on the behaviors of nuclear matter and NSs is discussed in detail. Systematic comparison with results previously obtained by employing Skyrme interactions is done for posteriors of both nuclear matter (NM) and NS parameters. Special attention is given to the model and constraints dependence of correlations among various quantities.</description>

Abstract: The production of light nuclei and hyper-nuclei in heavy-ion collisions, particularly at high baryon density, is crucial for understanding the dynamical evolution of the collision system and exploring the internal state of nuclear matter of compacted stellar object. Despite being a topic of ongoing debate, an improved theoretical understanding is necessary. In this work, production of light nuclei ($d$, $t$, $^{3}$He, $^{4}$He) and hyper-nuclei ($^{3}_{\Lambda}$H, $^{4}_{\Lambda}$H) was investigated using the JAM microscopic transport model combined with an afterburner coalescence process at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} =$ 3 GeV Au+Au collisions. The formation of a specific nucleus during the coalescence process is determined by its Wigner function. The comparison of the calculations for $\mathrm{p_T}$ spectra, average $\mathrm{p_T}$, and rapidity distributions to the measurements from the STAR experiment was performed. We investigated the dynamic information carried by light nuclei and determined the averaged spatial distance $\langle \Delta R \rangle$ and momentum difference $\langle \Delta P \rangle$ of constituent nucleons ($\Lambda$) for each nucleus species.</description>

      <title>Modelling stochastic fluctuations in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the information current, we develop a Lorentz-covariant framework for modeling equilibrium fluctuations in relativistic kinetic theory in the grand-canonical ensemble. The resulting stochastic theory is proven to be causal and covariantly stable, and its predictions do not depend on the choice of spacetime foliation used to define the grand-canonical probabilities. As expected, in a box containing $N{&gt;}5$ particles, Boltzmann's molecular chaos postulate is broken with (almost exact) probability $N^{-1/2}$, leading to a breakdown of the Boltzmann equation in small systems. We also verify that, in ultrarelativistic gases, transient hydrodynamics already accounts for at least 80% of the equilibrium fluctuations of the stress-energy tensor at a given time. Finally, we compute the correlators at non-equal times for two selected collision kernels: That of a chemically active diluted solution, and that of ultrarelativistic scalar particles self-interacting via a quartic potential. For the former, we compute the density-density correlators analytically in real space, and dehydrodynamization of the stochastic theory is proven to occur whenever the mean free path diverges at high energy.</description>

      <title>Examination of the evidence for a proton halo in $^{22}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More and more halo nuclei or candidates have been identified or suggested in experiments in recent years. It was declared that the halo structure of $^{22}$Al is revealed by the large isospin asymmetry in $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O mirror Gamow-Teller transitions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 192503 (2020)]. We highlight that a significant mirror asymmetry already exists between wave functions of the likely unbound nucleus $^{22}$Si and the doubly-magic nucleus $^{22}$O, which largely explains the observed asymmetry in the transitions. Furthermore, these transitions involve only the $1^+$ excited states of the daughter nuclei $^{22}$Al and $^{22}$F. The $1^+$ state of $^{22}$Al cannot be considered a halo state due to its proton-unbound nature. An analysis of the spin-parity suggests that a weakly bound $2s_{1/2}$ valence proton in the ground state of $^{22}$Al is improbable. To investigate the shell structure for the ground state of $^{22}$Al, we employ the state-of-the-art deformed and triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theories in continuum. We find that a small $s$-wave component of $5\%$ appears for the weakly bound valence proton in $^{22}$Al only when triaxial deformation is considered. While the examination of densities and rms radii indicates that this small $s$-wave component is insufficient to form a discernible proton halo in $^{22}$Al, slightly larger $2s_{1/2}$ occupations have been reported in other recent theoretical results. The question of how many low-$\ell$ components are sufficient to form a proton halo in the presence of the Coulomb barrier remains open. Thus, future measurements of reaction or interaction cross sections and momentum distributions of breakup fragments are highly desirable to verify whether $^{22}$Al is a halo nucleus.</description>

      <title>Reduction for one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in the relativistic quantum field theories at finite temperature and/or finite density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.11314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{conventional} Passarino-Veltman reduction is a systematic procedure based on the Lorentz covariance, which can efficiently reduce the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in the relativistic quantum field theories (QFTs) at zero temperature and zero density. However, the Lorentz covariance is explicitly broken when either of the temperature and density is finite, due to a rest reference frame of the many-body system in which the temperature and density are measured, rendering the \emph{conventional} Passarino-Veltman reduction not applicable anymore to reduce the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals therein. In this paper, we report a \emph{generalized} Passarino-Veltman reduction which can efficiently simplify the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in the relativistic QFTs at finite temperature and/or finite density. The \emph{generalized} Passarino-Veltman reduction can analyze the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in a wide range of physical systems described by the relativistic QFTs at finite temperature and/or finite density, such as quark-gluon plasma in nuclear physics.</description>

Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence, or holography, has provided numerous important insights into the behavior of strongly-coupled many-body systems. Crucially, it has provided a testing ground for the construction of new effective field theories, especially those in the low frequency, long wavelength limit known as hydrodynamics. We review the study of strongly-coupled rotating fluids using holography, and we examine the hydrodynamics emerging from the study of rotating Myers-Perry black holes. We discuss three regimes in which holographic rotating fluids display either (1) hydrodynamic behavior of a boosted fluid, (2) hydrodynamic behavior distinct from a boosted fluid, or (3) no obvious hydrodynamic behavior. We describe techniques to obtain hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic modes, and we compute the radius of convergence for the hydrodynamic regimes. The limitations of hydrodynamics under rotation are discussed alongside our findings.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum at Small $x$ Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18404</link>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of the small Bjorken-$x$ asymptotics of the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) distributions in the proton utilizing the revised small-$x$ helicity evolution derived recently. We relate the quark and gluon OAM distributions at small $x$ to the polarized dipole amplitudes and their (first) impact-parameter moments. To obtain the OAM distributions, we derive novel small-$x$ evolution equations for the impact-parameter moments of the polarized dipole amplitudes in the double-logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant). We solve these evolution equations numerically and extract the leading large-$N_c$, small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark and gluon OAM distributions, which we determine to be
  \begin{align}
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x, Q^2) \sim L_{G}(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma(x, Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^{3.66 \, \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}}, \notag
  \end{align} in agreement with the existing results in the literature within the precision of our numerical evaluation. (Here $N_c$ is the number of quark colors.) We also investigate the ratios of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to their helicity distribution counterparts in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for compact stars with exotic degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of the highly dense matter inside the supernova remnant compact star is not constrained by terrestrial experiments and hence modeled phenomenologically to accommodate the astrophysical observations from compact stars. The observable properties of the compact stars are highly sensitive to the microscopic model of highly dense matter. However, some universal relations exist between some macroscopic properties of compact stars independent of the matter model. We study the universal relation including the stars containing exotic degrees of freedom such as heavier strange and non-strange baryons, strange quark matter in normal and superconducting phases, etc. We examine the universal relations for quantities moment of inertia - tidal love number - quadrupole moment. We also study the correlation of non-radial f-mode and p-mode frequencies with stellar properties. We find the f-mode frequency observes the universal relation with dimensionless tidal deformability but the p-mode frequency does not show a good correlation with stellar properties. The p-mode frequency is sensitive to the composition of the matter. We find that universal relation is also applicable for stars with exotic matter in the core of the star with several models of exotic matter.</description>

      <title>A Collinear Perspective on the Regge Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high energy (Regge) limit provides a playground for understanding all loop structures of scattering amplitudes, and plays an important role in the description of many phenomenologically relevant cross-sections. While well understood in the planar limit, the structure of non-planar corrections introduces many fascinating complexities, for which a general organizing principle is still lacking. We study the structure of multi-reggeon exchanges in the context of the effective field theory for forward scattering, and derive their factorization into collinear operators (impact factors) and soft operators. We derive the structure of the renormalization group consistency equations in the effective theory, showing how the anomalous dimensions of the soft operators are related to those of the collinear operators, allowing us to derive renormalization group equations in the Regge limit purely from a collinear perspective. The rigidity of the consistency equations provides considerable insight into the all orders organization of Regge amplitudes in the effective theory, as well as its relation to other approaches. Along the way we derive a number of technical results that improve the understanding of the effective theory. We illustrate this collinear perspective by re-deriving all the standard BFKL equations for two-Glauber exchange from purely collinear calculations, and we show that this perspective provides a number of conceptual and computational advantages as compared to the standard view from soft or Glauber physics. We anticipate that this formulation in terms of collinear operators will enable a better understanding of the relation between BFKL and DGLAP in gauge theories, and facilitate the analysis of renormalization group evolution equations describing Reggeization beyond next-to-leading order.</description>
