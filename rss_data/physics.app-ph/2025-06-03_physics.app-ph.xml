      <title>Luminescence thermometry based on time gates: highly sensitive approach for real time sensing and imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undoubtedly, one of the most significant advantages of luminescence thermometry is its ability to be used not only for spot temperature measurements but also for imaging temperature changes. Among the commonly proposed approaches, luminescence thermometry based on luminescence kinetics holds particular promise. However, most thermometric studies rely on the analysis of luminescence decay profiles, a method that significantly hinders, if not entirely precludes, real-time thermal imaging. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on the luminescence intensity ratio integrated over two temporal gates. Tests conducted on two representative phosphors, Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+, demonstrate that the proposed method not only enables thermal imaging but also achieves substantially higher relative sensitivity, reaching SR=17.1 % K-1 for Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and SR=9.4 % K-1 for Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+, compared to the conventional lifetime-based approach (SR=4.2 % K-1 for Ba2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+ and SR=1.2 % K-1 for Ca2LaNbO6:1%Mn4+). Furthermore, careful selection of gate lengths allows optimization of the thermometric performance of the proposed luminescent thermometers. This approach enables expansion of the thermal operating range at the cost of relative sensitivity, providing versatility to adapt the thermometer for specific applications.</description>

      <title>NELM: Modern Open-Source Software for Multipurpose Impedance Spectra Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has become an advanced experimental technique with a wide range of applications: from simple passive circuits diagnostics to semiconductor high-end device development and breakthrough technologies in bio-sensing. Although hardware for EIS today is well developed, the EIS analysis software is mainly custom, old fashioned, i.e. it is limited by features, does not utilize the progress in the modern computer science and hardware, and is usually implemented in close-source code or written on outdated programming languages, which causes slow progress in field of the EIS and complicates researchers attempts of development in EIS autonomous devices, such as implants. In this article, we introduce a free and open-sourced MatLab/GNU Octave package for EIS analysis called NELM, which provides powerful equipment tools for matching experimental impedance data with theoretical equivalent circuits. Our software has an user friendly interface and supports different formats of input data, fitting programs, and impedance models. In addition, we have developed NELM with implementation of the latest progress in computation science such as symbolic calculations, parallel computing, and artificial intelligence. The abilities of NELM were validated by its applications in the different fields of science, such as semiconductor studies, bioimpedance and electrochemestry, which demonstrated high-efficiency of the proposed software package and showed that it is a promising tool for solving actual problems in electronic industry, biosensorics, and healthcare technologies.</description>

      <title>Heliostat Optical Error Inspection with Polarimetric Imaging Drone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) field, optical errors have significant impacts on the collection efficiency of heliostats. Fast, cost-effective, labor-efficient, and non-intrusive autonomous field inspection remains a challenge. Approaches using imaging drone, i.e., Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system integrated with high resolution visible imaging sensors, have been developed to address these challenges; however, these approaches are often limited by insufficient imaging contrast. Here we report a polarimetry-based method with a polarization imaging system integrated on UAV to enhance imaging contrast for in-situ detection of heliostat mirrors without interrupting field operation. We developed an optical model for skylight polarization pattern to simulate the polarization images of heliostat mirrors and obtained optimized waypoints for polarimetric imaging drone flight path to capture images with enhanced contrast. The polarimetric imaging-based method improved the success rate of edge detections in scenarios which were challenging for mirror edge detection with conventional imaging sensors. We have performed field tests to achieve significantly enhanced heliostat edge detection success rate and investigate the feasibility of integrating polarimetric imaging method with existing imaging-based heliostat inspection methods, i.e., Polarimetric Imaging Heliostat Inspection Method (PIHIM). Our preliminary field test results suggest that the PIHIM hold the promise to enable sufficient imaging contrast for real-time autonomous imaging and detection of heliostat field, thus suitable for non-interruptive fast CSP field inspection during its operation.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical modeling of receive transfer function and thermal noise of integrated photonic ultrasound transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound transducers (UTs) are extensively used in several applications across a multitude of disciplines. A new type of UTs namely integrated photonic ultrasound transducers (IPUTs) possess superior performance due to the presence of optical interrogation systems, avoiding electric crosstalk and thermal electronic noise of the sensor. However, a major component of the IPUT's noise floor is its thermal acoustic noise. Several studies have been proposed to characterize IPUTs' behavior; nevertheless, these are either incomplete (model only the thermal noise) or targeted to characterize specific responses such as static behavior, in which the modeled receive transfer function (RTF) is about two orders lower than the experiments. In this study, we develop semi-analytical models based on time-domain finite element analysis and analytical expressions to characterize the RTF and thermal noise-induced noise equivalent pressure of IPUTs. We validate the models by comparing them with the literature, where we obtain a close match between them.</description>

      <title>EMetaNode: Electromechanical Metamaterial Node for Broadband Vibration Attenuation and Self-powered Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in mechanical metamaterials and piezoelectric energy harvesting provide exciting opportunities to guide and convert the mechanical energy in electromechanical systems for autonomous sensing and vibration control. However, practical realizations remain rare due to the lack of advanced modeling methods and interdisciplinary barriers. By integrating mechanical metamaterials with power electronics-based interface circuits, this paper makes a breakthrough with an electromechanical friction-induced metamaterial node, which realizes self-powered sensing and broadband vibration attenuation in the same time. A reduced-order modeling-based numerical harmonic balance method has been established for general nonlinear metamaterials with local nonlinearities, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. The electromechanical friction induced by synchronized switching interface circuits has been revealed for the first time, leading to energy harvesting abilities and the broader nonlinear bandgap and higher harmonics induced vibration attenuation. Experimentally, an electromechanical metamaterial node is realized for self-powered sensing of temperature and acceleration data, highlighting its potential for structural health monitoring and Internet of Things applications. This study provides a practical path to digitalizing structures and systems for autonomous sensing and vibration control by combining advanced interface circuits with mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Inverse design for robust inference in integrated computational spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For computational spectrometers, we propose an inverse-design approach in which the scattering media are topology-optimized to achieve better performance in inference, without the need of a training set of spectra and a distribution of detector noise. Our approach also allows the selection of the inference algorithm to be decoupled from that of the scatterer. For smooth spectra, we additionally devise a regularized reconstruction algorithm based on Chebyshev interpolation, which yields higher accuracy compared with conventional methods in which the spectra are sampled at equally spaced frequencies/wavelengths with equal weights. Our approaches are numerically demonstrated via inverse design of integrated computational spectrometers and reconstruction of example spectra. The inverse-designed spectrometers exhibit significantly better performance in the presence of noise than their counterparts with random scatterers.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-Q Torsional Nanomechanics through Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently it was discovered that torsion modes of strained nanoribbons exhibit dissipation dilution, giving a route to enhanced torque sensing and quantum optomechanics experiments. As with all strained nanomechanical resonators, an important limitation is bending loss due to mode curvature at the clamps. Here we use Bayesian optimization to design nanoribbons with optimal dissipation dilution of the fundamental torsion mode. Applied to centimeter-scale Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbons, we realize $Q$ factors exceeding 100 million and $Q$-frequency products exceeding $10^{13}$ Hz at room temperature. The thermal torque sensitivity of the reported devices is at the level of $10^{-20}\;\text{N}\,\text{m}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and the zero point angular displacement spectral density is at the level of $10^{-10}\;\text{rad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$; they are moreover simple to fabricate, have high thermal conductivity, and can be heavily mass-loaded without diminishing their $Q$, making them attractive for diverse fundamental and applied weak force sensing tasks.</description>

      <title>On the fracture mechanics validity of small scale tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in conducting small-scale tests to gain additional insight into the fracture behaviour of components across a wide range of materials. For example, micro-scale mechanical tests inside of a microscope (\emph{in situ}) enable direct, high-resolution observation of the interplay between crack growth and microstructural phenomena (e.g., dislocation behaviour or the fracture resistance of a particular interface), and sub-size samples are increasingly used when only a limited amount of material is available. However, to obtain quantitative insight and extract relevant fracture parameters, the sample must be sufficiently large for a $J$- (HRR) or a $K$-field to exist. We conduct numerical and semi-analytical studies to map the conditions (sample geometry, material) that result in a valid, quantitative fracture experiment. Specifically, for a wide range of material properties, crack lengths and sample dimensions, we establish the maximum value of the $J$-integral where an HRR field ceases to exist (i.e., the maximum $J$ value at which fracture must occur for the test to be valid, $J_\mathrm{max}$). Maps are generated to establish the maximum valid $J$ value ($J_\mathrm{max}$) as a function of yield strength, strain hardening and minimum sample size. These maps are then used to discuss the existing experimental literature and provide guidance on how to conduct quantitative experiments. Finally, our study is particularised to the analysis of metals that have been embrittled due to hydrogen exposure. The response of relevant materials under hydrogen-containing environments are superimposed on the aforementioned maps, determining the conditions that will enable quantitative insight.</description>

      <title>Random Hyperbolic Graphs with Arbitrary Mesoscale Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks exhibit universal structural properties such as sparsity, small-worldness, heterogeneous degree distributions, high clustering, and community structures. Geometric network models, particularly Random Hyperbolic Graphs (RHGs), effectively capture many of these features by embedding nodes in a latent similarity space. However, networks are often characterized by specific connectivity patterns between groups of nodes -- i.e. communities -- that are not geometric, in the sense that the dissimilarity between groups do not obey the triangle inequality. Structuring connections only based on the interplay of similarity and popularity thus poses fundamental limitations on the mesoscale structure of the networks that RHGs can generate. To address this limitation, we introduce the Random Hyperbolic Block Model (RHBM), which extends RHGs by incorporating block structures within a maximum-entropy framework. We demonstrate the advantages of the RHBM through synthetic network analyses, highlighting its ability to preserve community structures where purely geometric models fail. Our findings emphasize the importance of latent geometry in network modeling while addressing its limitations in controlling mesoscale mixing patterns.</description>

      <title>Chaotic magnetization dynamics in magnetic Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a magnetic analogy of the Duffing oscillator--magnetic Duffing oscillator--which is characterized by a double-well magnetic potential of a ferromagnet with a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Based on the linear stability analysis of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the magnetic anisotropy field creates an anharmonicity on the magnetic potential, generating homoclinic orbits in the phase space. By evaluating the Lyapunov exponent, we demonstrate that the magnetic Duffing oscillator exhibits chaotic behaviors in the presence of periodically oscillating external forces: Oersted field and spin-orbit torque by considering the ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayer. We also show that the external magnetic field can be adjusted to generate or modify homoclinic orbits, thereby controlling the parameter range of the oscillating external forces that induce chaos. This work deepens our understanding of chaotic magnetization dynamics by bridging the fields of nonlinear dynamics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>A mesoscale phase-field model of intergranular liquid lithium corrosion of ferritic/martensitic steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A phase-field model is developed to simulate intergranular corrosion of ferritic/martensitic steels exposed to liquid lithium. The chromium concentration of the material is used to track the mass transport within the metal and liquid (corrosive) phase. The framework naturally captures intergranular corrosion by enhancing the diffusion of chromium along grain boundaries relative to the grain bulk with no special treatment for the corrosion front evolution. The formulation applies to arbitrary 2D and 3D polycrystalline geometries. The framework reproduces experimental measurements of weight loss and corrosion depth for a 9 wt\% Cr ferritic/martensitic steel exposed to static lithium at 600 $^\circ$C. A sensitivity analysis, varying near-surface grain density, grain size, and chromium depletion thickness, highlights the microstructural influence in the corrosion process. Moreover, the significance of saturation is considered and evaluated. Simulation results show that near-surface grain density is a deciding factor, whereas grain size dictates the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion.</description>

      <title>Exploring metrics for analyzing dynamic behavior in MPI programs via a coupled-oscillator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel, lightweight, and physically inspired approach to modeling the dynamics of parallel distributed-memory programs. Inspired by the Kuramoto model, we represent MPI processes as coupled oscillators with topology-aware interactions, custom coupling potentials, and stochastic noise. The resulting system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations opens a path to modeling key performance phenomena of parallel programs, including synchronization, delay propagation and decay, bottlenecks, and self-desynchronization.
  This paper introduces interaction potentials to describe memory- and compute-bound workloads and employs multiple quantitative metrics -- such as an order parameter, synchronization entropy, phase gradients, and phase differences -- to evaluate phase coherence and disruption. We also investigate the role of local noise and show that moderate noise can accelerate resynchronization in scalable applications. Our simulations align qualitatively with MPI trace data, showing the potential of physics-informed abstractions to predict performance patterns, which offers a new perspective for performance modeling and software-hardware co-design in parallel computing.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence-Based Gas Sensing with MoS2 Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties of anisotropic materials. Here we derive closed-form expressions for the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of uniaxial and biaxial spheres and ellipsoids. We show that such particles exhibit novel radiation patterns and axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting and eigenvalue degeneracy. Finally, we analytically predict the Q-factors of the resonance peaks. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers and apply to other fields of physics.</description>

      <title>A Polarimetry-based Field-deployable Non-interruptive Mirror Soiling Detection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The soiling level of heliostat mirrors in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) fields is one of the key factors that significantly influences optical efficiency. State-of-the-art methods of monitoring heliostats soiling levels still face various challenges, including slow speed, labor-intensive operations, resolution and accuracy constraints or interruptions to solar field operations. We present a rapid, cost-effective, and non-intrusive method for mirror soiling detection based on polarimetric imaging, referred to as Polarimetric Imaging-based Mirror Soiling (PIMS). The compact PIMS device is designed for integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling rapid, large-area assessments of heliostat mirrors for efficient soiling detection. Our method utilizes the correlation between the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and surface soiling level based on Mie scattering theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Field deployment of the PIMS method requires minimal device installation, and its UAV-based operation allows for soiling detection without interrupting plant activities. The PIMS method holds the potential for mirror soiling detection across various concentrated solar power (CSP) plants and can be further adapted for other types of solar fields, such as parabolic trough systems.</description>

      <title>Electron Fourier ptychography for phase reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase reconstruction is important in transmission electron microscopy for structural studies. We describe electron Fourier ptychography and its application to phase reconstruction of both radiation-resistant and beam-sensitive materials. We demonstrate that the phase of the exit wave can be reconstructed to high resolution using a modified iterative phase retrieval algorithm using data collected in an alternative optical geometry. This method achieves a spatial resolution of 0.63 nm at a fluence of $4.5 \times 10^2 \, e^-/\text{nm}^2$, as validated on Cry11Aa protein crystals under cryogenic conditions. Notably, this method requires no additional hardware modifications, is straightforward to implement, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing data collection software, providing a broadly accessible alternative approach to structural studies.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic in-memory computing using magnetic topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have been proven effective for essential quantum computation tasks such as quantum error correction and quantum control. Efficient hardware implementation of these algorithms at cryogenic temperatures is essential. Here, we utilize magnetic topological insulators as memristors (termed magnetic topological memristors) and introduce a cryogenic in-memory computing scheme based on the coexistence of the chiral edge state and the topological surface state. The memristive switching and reading of the giant anomalous Hall effect exhibit high energy efficiency, high stability, and low stochasticity. We achieve high accuracy in a proof-of-concept classification task using four magnetic topological memristors. Furthermore, our algorithm-level and circuit-level simulations of large-scale neural networks demonstrate software-level accuracy and lower energy consumption for image recognition and quantum state preparation compared with existing magnetic memristor and CMOS technologies. Our results not only showcase a new application of chiral edge states but also may inspire further topological quantum physics-based novel computing schemes.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Azimuthal Trapping of Dissipative Kerr Multi-Solitons for Relative Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal cavity solitons, or dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in integrated microresonators, are essential for deployable metrology technologies. Such applications favor the lowest noise state, typically the single-DKS state where one soliton is in the resonator. Other multi-DKS states can also be reached, offering better conversion efficiency and thermal stability, potentially simplifying DKS-based technologies. Yet they exhibit more noise due to relative soliton jitter, and are usually not compatible with targeted applications. We demonstrate that Kerr-induced synchronization, an all-optical trapping technique, can azimuthally pin the multi-DKS state to a common reference field. This method ensures repetition rate noise independent of the number of solitons, making a multi-DKS state indistinguishable from a single-DKS state in that regard, akin to trapped-soliton molecule behavior. Supported by theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration in an integrated microresonator, this approach provides metrological capacity regardless of the number of cavity solitons, benefiting numerous DKS-based metrology applications.</description>
