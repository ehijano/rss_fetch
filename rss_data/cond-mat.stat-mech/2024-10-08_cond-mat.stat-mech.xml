      <title>Hydrodynamic equations and near critical large deviations of active lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a path integral approach, we derive and study the hydrodynamic equations and large deviation functions for three active lattice gases. After a review of the path integral for master equations, we first look at a one dimensional model of motility induced phase separation (MIPS), re-deriving the large deviation function that was previously found through a mapping to the ABC model. After extracting the deterministic hydrodynamic equations from the large deviation function, we analyse them perturbatively near the MIPS critical point using a weakly non-linear analysis. Doing this we show that they reduce to equilibrium Model B very close to criticality, with non-equilibrium, or Active Model B+ terms emerging as we leave the critical region. The same type of weakly non-linear analysis is then applied to the full large deviation function, and we show that the near critical stationary probability distribution is given by the exponential of a $\phi^4$ free energy, as expected in ordinary equilibrium phase separation. Similar calculations are then done for the two other lattice gases, one of flocking, and another MIPS model, and in both cases we find analogous results.</description>

      <title>System Symmetry and the Classification of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator Dynamics in Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry of chaotic systems plays a pivotal role in determining the universality class of spectral statistics and dynamical behaviors, which can be described within the framework of random matrix theory. Understanding the influence of system symmetry on these behaviors is crucial for characterizing universal properties in quantum chaotic systems. In this work, we explore the universality of out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) dynamics in quantum chaotic systems, focusing on the kicked rotor and the kicked Harper model. By modulating the periodically kicked potential, we control system symmetry to examine its impact on OTOC dynamics and level spacing distributions. Our results show that ensemble-averaged OTOC dynamics exhibit distinct universal behaviors depending on system symmetry, enabling classification through random matrix theory. These distinctions become evident after the localization time in localized regimes and emerge at specific time scales corresponding to the translational period of the Floquet operator in momentum space under quantum resonance conditions. Our findings provide a rigorous understanding of the relationship between symmetry and quantum chaotic dynamics, contributing to a deeper comprehension of universal behaviors in these systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient sampling using Macrocanonical Monte Carlo and density of states mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Monte Carlo sampling for lattice models, the complexity of the energy landscape often leads to Markov chains being trapped in local optima, thereby increasing the correlation between samples and reducing sampling efficiency. This study proposes a Monte Carlo algorithm that effectively addresses the irregularities of the energy landscape through the introduction of the estimated density of states. This algorithm enhances the accuracy in the study of phase transitions and is not model-specific. Although our algorithm is primarily demonstrated on the two-dimensional square lattice model, the method is also applicable to a broader range of lattice and higher-dimensional models. Furthermore, the study develops a method for estimating the density of states of large systems based on that of smaller systems, enabling high-precision density of states estimation within specific energy intervals in large systems without sampling. For regions of lower precision, a re-weighting strategy is employed to adjust the density of states to enhance the precision further. This algorithm is not only significant within the field of lattice model sampling but may also inspire applications of the Monte Carlo method in other domains.</description>

      <title>Distance Form Factor of a Homogeneous Poisson Point Process and a Coulomb Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a distance form factor (DFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the DFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the DFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The DFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the DFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The DFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process.</description>

      <title>Localization transitions in quadratic systems without quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitions from delocalized to localized eigenstates have been extensively studied in both quadratic and interacting models. The delocalized regime typically exhibits diffusion and quantum chaos, and its properties comply with the random matrix theory (RMT) predictions. However, it is also known that in certain quadratic models, the delocalization in position space is not accompanied by the single-particle quantum chaos. Here, we study the one-dimensional Anderson and Wannier-Stark models that exhibit eigenstate transitions from localization in quasimomentum space (supporting ballistic transport) to localization in position space (with no transport) in a nonstandard thermodynamic limit, which assumes rescaling the model parameters with the system size. We show that the transition point may exhibit an unconventional character of Janus type, i.e., some measures hint at the RMT-like universality emerging at the transition point, while others depart from it. For example, the eigenstate entanglement entropies may exhibit, depending on the bipartition, a volume-law behavior that either approaches the value of Haar-random Gaussian states, or converges to a lower, non-universal value. Our results hint at rich diversity of volume-law eigenstate entanglement entropies in quadratic systems that are not maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Level-Set Percolation on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solution of the problem of level-set percolation for multivariate Gaussians defined in terms of weighted graph Laplacians on complex networks. It is achieved using a cavity or message passing approach, which allows one to obtain the essential ingredient required for the solution, viz. a self-consistent determination of locally varying percolation probabilities. The cavity solution can be evaluated both for single large instances of locally tree-like graphs, and in the thermodynamic limit of random graphs of finite mean degree in the configuration model class. The critical level $h_c$ of the percolation transition is obtained through the condition that the largest eigenvalue of a weighted version $B$ of a non-backtracking matrix satisfies $\lambda_{\rm max}(B)|_{h_c} =1$. We present level-dependent distributions of local percolation probabilities for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks and and for networks with degree distributions described by power laws. We find that there is a strong correlation between marginal single-node variances of a massless multivariate Gaussian and local percolation probabilities at a given level $h$, which is nearly perfect at negative values $h$, but weakens as $h\nearrow 0$ for the system with power law degree distribution, and generally also for negative values of $h$, if the multivariate Gaussian acquires a non-zero mass. The theoretical analysis simplifies in the case of random regular graphs with uniform edge-weights of the weighted graph Laplacian of the system and uniform mass parameter of the Gaussian field. An asymptotic analysis reveals that for edge-weights $K=K(c)\equiv 1$ the critical percolation threshold $h_c$ decreases to 0, as the degree $c$ of the random regular graph diverges. For $K=K(c)=1/c$, on the other hand, the critical percolation threshold $h_c$ is shown to diverge as $c\to\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many times a diffusing molecule can permeate across a membrane or be adsorbed on a substrate? We employ the encounter-based approach to find the statistics of adsorption or permeation events for molecular diffusion in a general confining medium. Various features of these statistics are illustrated for two practically relevant cases of a flat boundary and a spherical confinement. Some applications of these fundamental results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent conductivity of nanometric semiconductor thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanomenters thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.</description>

      <title>Stochastic cloaking: concealing a region from diffusive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel class of cloaking in which a region of space is concealed from an ensemble of diffusing particles whose individual trajectories are governed by a stochastic (Langevin) equation. In particular, we simulate how different interpretations of the Langevin equation affect the cloaking performance of an annular single-layer invisibility cloak of smoothly varying diffusivity in two dimensions. Near-perfect cloaking is achieved under the Ito convention, indicated by the cloak preventing particles from accessing an inner core while simultaneously preserving the particle density outside the cloak relative to simulations involving no protected region (and no cloak). Even better cloaking performance can be achieved by regularising the singular behaviour of the cloak -- which we demonstrate through two different approaches. These results establish the foundations of ``stochastic cloaking'', which we believe to be a significant milestone following that of optical and thermal cloaking.</description>

      <title>Long-range angular correlations of particle displacements at a plastic-to-elastic transition in jammed amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how a flow turns into an amorphous solid is a fundamental challenge in statistical physics, during which no apparent structural ordering appears. In the athermal limit, the two states are connected by a well-defined jamming transition, near which the solid is marginally stable. A recent mechanical response screening theory proposes an additional transition above jamming, called a plastic-to-elastic transition here, separating anomalous and quasi-elastic mechanical behavior. Through numerical inflation simulations in two dimensions, we show that the onsets of long-range radial and angular correlations of particle displacements decouple, occurring respectively at the jamming and plastic-to-elastic transitions. The latter is characterized by a power-law diverging correlation angle and a power-law spectrum of the displacements along a circle. This work establishes two-step transitions on the mechanical properties during ``decompression melting'' of an athermal over-jammed amorphous solid, reminiscent of the two-step structural melting of a crystal in two dimensions. In contradistinction with the latter, the plastic-to-elastic transition exists also in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Truncated Gaussian basis approach for simulating many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Truncated Gaussian Basis Approach (TGBA) for simulating the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. The approach constructs an effective Hamiltonian within a reduced subspace, spanned by fermionic Gaussian states, and diagonalizes it to obtain approximate eigenstates and eigenenergies. Symmetries can be exploited to perform parallel computation, enabling to simulate systems with much larger sizes. As an example, we compute the dynamic structure factor and study quench dynamics in a non-integrable quantum Ising chain, known as ``$E_8$ magnet''. The mass ratios calculated through the dynamic structure factor show excellent agreement with Zamolodchikov's analytical predictions. For quench dynamics we observe that time-evolving wave functions in the truncated subspace facilitates the simulation of long-time dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to model the generic stochastic nonlinear dynamics of a quantum state in Hilbert space. Our approach features an underlying linearity in the dynamical equations, ensuring the applicability of techniques used for solving linear systems. Additionally, it offers the advantage of easily incorporating statistical symmetry, a generalization of explicit symmetry to stochastic processes. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to describe real-time dynamics, starting from an initial symmetry-preserving state and evolving into a randomly distributed, symmetry-breaking final state. Our model serves as a quantum framework for the transition process, from disordered states to ordered ones, where symmetry is spontaneously broken.</description>

Abstract: We describe a symplectic approach to thermodynamics in which thermodynamic transformations are described by Hamiltonian dynamics on thermodynamic spaces. By identifying the spaces of equilibrium states with Lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold, we construct a Hamiltonian description of thermodynamic processes where the space of equilibrium states of a system in a certain ensemble is the level set on which the Hamiltonian takes a constant value. In particular, we work out two explicit examples involving the ideal gas. Finally, we describe a Hamiltonian approach towards constructing maps between related thermodynamic systems, e.g., the ideal (non-interacting) gas and interacting gases.</description>

Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved operator for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved operators corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic `in' and `out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOC have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Conversion from Classical to Quantum Randomness via Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here we propose a modified scheme, in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Modular Spread Complexity for Non-Hermitian Density Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we generalize the concept of modular spread complexity to the cases where the reduced density matrix is non-Hermitian. This notion of complexity and associated Lanczos coefficients contain richer information than the pseudo-entropy, which turns out to be one of the first Lanczos coefficients. We also define the quantity pseudo-capacity which generalizes capacity of entanglement, and corresponds to the early modular-time measure of pseudo-modular complexity. We describe how pseudo-modular complexity can be calculated using a slightly modified bi-Lanczos algorithm. Alternatively, the (complex) Lanczos coefficients can also be obtained from the analytic expression of the pseudo-R\'enyi entropy, which can then be used to calculate the pseudo-modular spread complexity. We show some analytical calculations for 2-level systems and 4-qubit models and then do numerical investigations on the quantum phase transition of transverse field Ising model, from the (pseudo) modular spread complexity perspective. As the final example, we consider the $3d$ Chern-Simon gauge theory with Wilson loops to understand the role of topology on modular complexity. The concept of pseudo-modular complexity introduced here can be a useful tool for understanding phases and phase transitions in quantum many body systems, quantum field theories and holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06390v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-range order in two dimensions where an order parameter is advected by laminar flows such as rotational, shear, and elongational flows. Under these flows, we analyze an ordered state of the $O(N)$ scalar model in the large-$N$ limit. We show that the stability of the ordered state depends on the flow pattern; shear and elongational flows stabilize the long-range order but rotational flow does not. We discuss the physical mechanism underlying our results by connecting static correlations of fluctuations and their dynamics based on the interaction representation used in quantum mechanics. We find that advective transport induces superdiffusion under shear and elongational flows, thereby stabilizing the long-range order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a cycling three-state Potts model is studied on a square lattice using Monte Carlo simulations and continuum theory. This model is relevant to chemical reactions on a catalytic surface and to molecular transport across a membrane. Several characteristic modes are formed depending on the flipping energies between successive states and the contact energies between neighboring sites. Under cyclic symmetry conditions, cycling homogeneous phases and spiral waves form at low and high flipping energies, respectively. In the intermediate flipping energy regime, these two modes coexist temporally in small systems and/or at low contact energies. Under asymmetric conditions, we observed small biphasic domains exhibiting amoeba-like locomotion and temporal coexistence of spiral waves and a dominant non-cyclic one-state phase. An increase in the flipping energy between two successive states, say state 0 and state 1, while keeping the other flipping energies constant, induces the formation of the third phase (state 2), owing to the suppression of the nucleation of state 0 domains. Under asymmetric conditions regarding the contact energies, two different modes can appear depending on the initial state, due to a hysteresis phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory and the Inverse Scattering Method to determine the full long-time statistics of the energy density $u(x,t)$ averaged over a given spatial interval, $$U =\frac{1}{2L}\int_{-L}^{L}dx\, u(x,t),$$ in a freely expanding Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) lattice gas on the line, following the release at $t=0$ of a finite amount of energy at the origin. In particular, we show that, as time $t$ goes to infinity at fixed $L$, the large deviation function of $U$ approaches a universal, $L$-independent form when expressed in terms of the energy content of the interval $|x|&lt;L$. A key part of the solution is the determination of the most likely configuration of the energy density at time $t$, conditional on $U$.</description>

      <title>Condensates in aggregation processes with input: A new power law and intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-mass condensates, which coexist with a power-law-decaying distribution in the one-dimensional Takayasu model of mass aggregation with input, were recently found in numerical simulations. Here we establish the occurrence of condensates by analyzing exact recursions for finite systems, and further show that they have a strong effect on the properties of the system. In the steady state of a large but finite system, there is a single condensate, whose random movement through the system leads to a reorganization of the mass profile on a macroscopic scale. A scaling analysis of the mean mass and standard deviation at different distances from the condensate leads to the surprising conclusion that the mass distribution on a macroscopic number of sites around the condensate follows a power-law decay with an exponent 5/3, while further-away sites show the customary Takayasu exponent 4/3, with a crossover in between. Finally, the exit of condensates from a system with open boundaries has a strong effect on the temporal fluctuations of the total mass in the steady state. Their departure is followed by a build-up of mass and subsequent departures, leading to strong intermittency, established through a divergence of the flatness as the scaled time approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Emergent family of Tsallis entropies from the $q$-deformed combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the derivation of a formula for the $q$-generalised multinomial coefficient rooted in the $q$-deformed algebra, a foundational framework in the study of nonextensive statistics. Previous approximate expressions in the literature diverge as $q$ approaches 2 (or 0, depending on convention). In contrast, our derived formula provides an exact, smooth function for all real values of $q$, expressed as an infinite series expansion involving Tsallis entropies with sequential entropic indices, coupled with Bernoulli numbers. This formulation is achieved through the analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function, stemming from the $q$-deformed factorials. Our formula thus offers a distinctive characterisation of Tsallis entropy within the $q$-deformed combinatorics. Throughout this exploration, we also highlight a symmetry within the $q$-deformed theory that links different values of the entropic parameter. Furthermore, we discuss extending our results to encompass more general, affinity-sensitive cases, building on the previously established framework of affinity-based extended entropy.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical equations of motion for multiple baths (HEOM-MB) and their application to Carnot cycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a computer code for the thermodynamic hierarchical equations of motion derived from a spin subsystem coupled to multiple Drude baths at different temperatures, which are connected to or disconnected from the subsystem as a function of time. The code can simulate the reduced dynamics of the subsystem under isothermal, isentropic, thermostatic, and entropic conditions. The extensive and intensive thermodynamic variables are calculated as physical observables, and Gibbs and Helmholtz energies are evaluated as intensive and extensive work. The energy contribution of the system--bath interaction is evaluated separately from the subsystem using the hierarchical elements of the HEOM. The accuracy of the calculated results for the equilibrium distribution and the two-body correlation functions are assessed by contrasting the results with those obtained from the time-convolution-less Redfield equation. It is shown that the Lindblad master equation is inappropriate for thermodynamic description of a spin--boson system. Non-Markovian effects in thermostatic processes are investigated by sequentially turning on and off the baths at different temperatures with different switching times and system--bath coupling. In addition, the Carnot cycle is simulated under quasi-static conditions. To analyze the work done for the subsystem in the cycle, thermodynamic work diagrams are plotted as functions of intensive and extensive variables. The C++ source codes are provided as supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the critical behavior of classical frustrated systems using the nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) equation. Our study is performed within the local potential approximation of this equation to which is added the flow of the field renormalization. Our flow equations are functional to avoid possible artifacts coming from the field expansion of the fixed point potential which consists in keeping only a limited number of coupling constants. We explain in detail our numerical implementation, its advantages and the difficulties encountered in the vicinity of $d=2$. For $N$-component spins, the function $N_c(d)$ separating the regions of first and second order transitions in the $(d,N)$ plane is computed for $d$ between 4 and 2.3. Our results confirm what was previously found with cruder approximations of the NPRG equation and contradict both the fixed dimension perturbative approach and some of the results obtained within the conformal bootstrap approach.</description>

      <title>$1/f$ noise in semiconductors arising from the heterogeneous detrapping process of individual charge carriers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07009v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of $1/f$ noise in semiconductors based on the drift of individual charge carriers and their interaction with the trapping centers. We assume that the trapping centers are homogeneously distributed in the material. The trapping centers are assumed to be heterogeneous and have unique detrapping rates. We show that uniform detrapping rate distribution emerges as a natural consequence of the vacant trap depths following the Boltzmann distribution, and the detrapping process obeying Arrhenius law. When these laws apply, and if the trapping rate is low in comparison to the maximum detrapping rate, $1/f$ noise in the form of Hooge's relation is recovered. Hooge's parameter, $\alpha_{H}$, is shown to be a ratio between the characteristic trapping rate and the maximum detrapping rate. The proposed model implies that $1/f$ noise arises from the temporal charge carrier number fluctuations, not from the spatial mobility fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of quenched disorder, the interplay between local magnetic-moment formation and Anderson localization for electrons at a zero-temperature, metal-insulator transition (MIT) remains a long unresolved problem. Here, we study the emergence of these phenomena in a power-law random banded matrix model of spin-1/2 fermions with repulsive Hubbard interactions. Focusing on the regime of weak interactions, we perform both analytical field theory and numerical self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations. We show that interference-mediated effects strongly enhance the density of states and magnetic fluctuations upon approaching the MIT from the metallic side. These are consistent with results due to Finkel'stein obtained four decades ago. Our numerics further show that local moments nucleate from typical states as we cross the MIT, with a density that grows continuously into the insulating phase. We identify spin-glass order in the insulator by computing the overlap distribution between converged Hartree-Fock mean-field moment profiles. Our results indicate that itinerant interference effects can morph smoothly into moment formation and magnetic frustration within a single model, revealing a common origin for these disparate phenomena.</description>

      <title>Queues with service resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Service time fluctuations heavily affect the performance of queueing systems, causing long waiting times and backlogs. Recently, it was shown that when service times are solely determined by the server, service resetting can mitigate the deleterious effects of service time fluctuations and drastically improve queue performance (Bonomo et al.,2022). Yet, in many queueing systems, service times have two independent sources: the intrinsic server slowdown ($S$) and the jobs' inherent size ($X$). In these, so-called $S\&amp;X$ queues (Gardner et al., 2017), service resetting results in a newly drawn server slowdown while the inherent job size remains unchanged. Remarkably, resetting can be useful even then. To show this, we develop a comprehensive theory of $S\&amp;X$ queues with service resetting. We consider cases where the total service time is either a product or a sum of the service slowdown and the jobs' inherent size. For both cases, we derive expressions for the total service time distribution and its mean under a generic service resetting policy. Two prevalent resetting policies are discussed in more detail. We first analyze the constant-rate (Poissonian) resetting policy and derive explicit conditions under which resetting reduces the mean service time and improves queue performance. Next, we consider the sharp (deterministic) resetting policy. While results hold regardless of the arrival process, we dedicate special attention to the $S\&amp;X$-M/G/1 queue with service resetting, and obtain the distribution of the number of jobs in the system and their sojourn time. Our analysis highlights situations where service resetting can be used as an effective tool to improve the performance of $S\&amp;X$ queueing systems. Several examples are given to illustrate our analytical results, which are corroborated using numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of quantum neural networks is a fundamental task in quantum information science with wide impact in physics, chemistry and machine learning. In this work, we show that the late-time training dynamics of quantum neural networks with a quadratic loss function can be described by the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, which lead to a transcritical bifurcation transition in the dynamics. When the targeted value of loss function crosses the minimum achievable value from above to below, the dynamics evolve from a frozen-kernel dynamics to a frozen-error dynamics, showing a duality between the quantum neural tangent kernel and the total error. In both regions, the convergence towards the fixed point is exponential, while at the critical point becomes polynomial. We provide a non-perturbative analytical theory to explain the transition via a restricted Haar ensemble at late time, when the output state approaches the steady state. Via mapping the Hessian to an effective Hamiltonian, we also identify a linearly vanishing gap at the transition point. Compared with the linear loss function, we show that a quadratic loss function within the frozen-error dynamics enables a speedup in the training convergence. The theory findings are verified experimentally on IBM quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We make lattice generalization of two well-known zero-dimensional models of quantum spin glass, Sachdev-Ye (SY) and spherical quantum $p$-spin glass model, to one dimension for studying crossovers in non-local scrambling dynamics due to glass transition, complex dynamics, and quantum and thermal fluctuations in paramagnetic (PM) and spin glass (SG) phases. In the SY chain of quantum dots, each described by infinite-range random Heisenberg model of $N$ spin-$S$ $SU(M)$ spins, we obtain the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and butterfly velocity $v_B$ as a function of temperature $T$ and the quantum parameter $S$ across the PM-SG phase boundary using a bosonic spinon representation in the large $N,M$ limit. In particular, we extract asymptotic $T$ and $S$ dependence, e.g., power laws, for $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ in different regions deep inside the phases and near the replica symmetry breaking SG transition. We find the chaos to be non-maximal almost over the entire phase diagram. Very similar results for chaos indicators are found for the $p$-spin glass chain as a function of temperature and a suitable quantum parameter $\Gamma$, with some important qualitative differences. In particular, $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ exhibit a maximum, coinciding with onset of complex glassy relaxation, above the glass transition as a function of $T$ and $\Gamma$ in the PM phase of the $p$-spin glass model. In contrast, the maximum is only observed as a function of $S$, but not with temperature, in the PM phase of SY model. The maximum originates from enhanced chaos due to maximal complexity in the glassy landscape. Thus, the results in the SY model indicate very different evolution of glassy complexity with quantum and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Topological effect on the Anderson transition in chiral symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of an emergent quasi-localized phase in chiral symmetry classes, where wave function along a spatial direction with weak topology is delocalized but exponentially localized along the other directions. The Anderson transition in 2D chiral symmetry classes is induced by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs of a U(1) phase degree of freedom, while the weak topology endows the pair with the Berry phase. We argue that the Berry phase induces spatial polarizations of the pairs along the topological direction through the quantum interference effect, and the proliferation of the polarized vortex pairs results in the quasi-localized phase.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1)-symmetric circuits for certain weak symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Gibbs-preserving operations requiring infinite amount of quantum coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gibbs-preserving operations have been studied as one of the standard free processes in quantum thermodynamics. Although they admit a simple mathematical structure, their operational significance has been unclear due to the potential hidden cost to implement them using an operatioanlly motivated class of operations, such as thermal operations. Here, we show that this hidden cost can be infinite -- we present a family of Gibbs-preserving operations that cannot be implemented by thermal operations aided by any finite amount of quantum coherence. Our result implies that there are uncountably many Gibbs-preserving operations that require unbounded thermodynamic resources to implement, raising a question about employing Gibbs-preserving operations as available thermodynamics processes. This finding is a consequence of the general lower bounds we provide for the coherence cost of approximately implementing a certain class of Gibbs-preserving operations with a desired accuracy. We find that our lower bound is almost tight, identifying a quantity -- related to the energy change caused by the channel to implement -- as a fundamental quantifier characterizing the coherence cost for the approximate implementation of Gibbs-preserving operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Activity-induced phase transition and coarsening dynamics in dry apolar active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Lebwohl-Lasher interaction for reciprocal local alignment, we present a comprehensive phase diagram for a dry, apolar, active nematic system using its stochastic \new{off-lattice} dynamics. \new{The nematic-isotropic transition in this system is first-order and occurs alongside a fluctuation-dominated phase separation.} Our phase diagram identifies three distinct regions based on activity and orientational noise relative to alignment strength: a homogeneous isotropic phase, a nematic phase with giant density fluctuations, and a coexistence region. Using mean-field analysis and hydrodynamic theory, we demonstrate that reciprocal interactions lead to a density fluctuation-induced first-order transition and derive a phase boundary consistent with numerical results. Quenching from the isotropic to nematic phase reveals coarsening dynamics where nematic ordering precedes particle clustering. Both the nematic and density fields exhibit similar scaling behaviors, exhibiting dynamic exponents $z_S \approx 2.5$ and $z_\rho \approx 2.34$, consistently falling within the range of 2 and 3.</description>

      <title>Integrability of open boundary driven quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary. We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for 1-matrix quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of Krylov complexity, a measure of operator growth, within the framework of 1-matrix quantum mechanics (1-MQM). Krylov complexity quantifies how an operator evolves over time by expanding it in a series of nested commutators with the Hamiltonian. We analyze the Lanczos coefficients derived from the correlation function, revealing their linear growth even in this integrable system. This growth suggests a link to chaotic behavior, typically unexpected in integrable systems. Our findings in both ground and thermal states of 1-MQM provide new insights into the nature of complexity in quantum mechanical models and lay the groundwork for further studies in more complex holographic theories.</description>
