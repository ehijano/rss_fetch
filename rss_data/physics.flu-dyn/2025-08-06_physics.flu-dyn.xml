      <title>Numerical investigation of engine position effects on contrail formation and evolution in the near-field of a realistic aircraft configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the impact of engine position on contrail formation and near-field evolution in a realistic three-dimensional aircraft configuration. Detailed numerical simulations are conducted using a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach coupled with mesh adaptation techniques. A Eulerian microphysical model is used to characterize contrail ice crystal properties and their evolution under varying dilution conditions. The setup is based on a Boeing 777-like geometry, including fuselage, wings, engines, and tailplane. Two microphysical activation scenarios are considered: one incorporating adsorption-based ice nucleation and the other assuming fully activated soot particles. The latter for two soot number emission indices. The dilution process and wake structure exhibit a strong dependence on engine placement, which significantly influences plume saturation. In highly diluted configurations, enhanced early-stage mixing reduces plume temperature and increases relative humidity, favoring the growth of larger ice crystals. Depending on the soot number concentration, vapor depletion effects may outweigh dilution-driven changes in water vapor availability. In adsorption-limited activation scenarios, increased dilution reduces the concentration of sulfur species, leading to a lower activation fraction and the formation of smaller ice crystals. Additionally, across the scenarios, the modified jet-vortex interaction alters particle distribution and their access to water vapor, further shaping their growth. These effects ultimately impact the contrail's optical properties, particularly its optical thickness.</description>

      <title>Power loss mechanisms and optimal induction factors for realistic large wind farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power loss mechanisms in large wind farms are complex due to the multiscale nature of wind farm aerodynamics. Recent studies based on the two-scale momentum theory have brought new insights into this field; however, most of them have been limited to idealised wind farm scenarios. To better understand the power performance of real wind farms, in this study we extend the framework of the two-scale momentum theory to non-ideal turbine design and layout scenarios, and then introduce simple analytical sub-models to account for the associated power losses. These extensions provide a holistic view of how the turbine design, layout, operating conditions and atmospheric conditions collectively determine the amounts of different types of power losses in real wind farms, including the losses due to turbine-wake interference (i.e. `internal' power loss) and farm-atmosphere interaction (i.e. `external' power loss). We also present a simple iterative method for calculating the optimal farm induction factor that maximises the overall farm power for a given set of conditions, including the atmospheric boundary layer height. Analogously to the blade-element momentum theory playing a key role in wind turbine design optimisation, the present theory is expected to play a key role in wind farm design optimisation.</description>

      <title>Water Entry Dynamics of Superhydrophobic and Lubricant-Impregnated Surfaces: A Theoretical and Experimental Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this current work, a comprehensive investigation into the impact dynamics of superhydrophobic and lubricant-impregnated aluminium sphere balls on liquid surfaces were carried out. The study delves into the hydrodynamic lubrication behavior and the resulting phenomena during impact. The Worthington jet and cavity associated give more insight into fundamental forces. The experimental analysis and theoretical modeling suggest potential applications in various fields such as fluid dynamics, tribology, and materials science. The stability investigation on an aluminum-textured sphere ball is carried out, and the evaluation of jet height and pinch-off phenomena is analyzed in detail. The experiment on entrapped air on a superhydrophobic surface and the oil inside the LIS for greater height was performed. The experimental setup involved a carefully designed apparatus for impact analysis by utilizing high-speed imaging techniques. Parameters such as impact velocity, Weber number, and sphere diameter were systematically varied to understand their influence on the observed dynamics. The lubricant viscosity is chosen such that it is comparable to water viscosity. Furthermore, the study on Lubricant Impregnated Surfaces (LIS) assessed frictional losses, i.e., drag reduction, compared to control and textured surfaces. In conclusion, the valuable insights into the impact dynamics advance our understanding of hydrodynamic lubrication and its applications. The findings presented here underscore the importance of further research in optimizing surface properties, selecting suitable lubricants, and exploring broader applications in the fields of fluid dynamics, surface engineering, and mechanical engineering.</description>

      <title>CFD simulation of a Rushton turbine stirred-tank using open-source software with critical evaluation of MRF-based rotation modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical evaluation of the impact of the Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) technique on steady RANS simulations of a Rushton turbine stirred-tanks is presented. The analysis, based on the open source software OpenFOAM, is focused on the choice of the diameter and thickness of the MRF region and on their effect on the predicted velocity field and mixing times in the tank. Five diameters of the MRF region are compared for the same operating conditions of the turbine, showing limited differences in velocity profiles, which are found in general good agreement with available experimental data. Significant differences are nonetheless found in the predicted levels of turbulence intensity within the tank, with a considerable amount of artificially generated turbulence at the boundary of the MRF region for the largest diameters. The impact of the different predictions of the turbulent field on the modeling of the mixing process in the tank is evaluated by simulating the release of a passive scalar, using the frozen-flow field hypothesis. The results show changes in mixing times up to a factor of three when comparing MRF regions of different size. Thus, the present investigation highlights the importance of assessing the effect of the MRF zone size on numerical results as a standard practice in RANS based simulations of stirred-tanks.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal wall pressure forecast of a rectangular cylinder with physics-aware DeepUFNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance, where the parameter $\beta$ varies with the development of the training epoch. Wind tunnel testing is performed to collect wall pressures of a two-dimensional rectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 at an angle of attack of zero using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found to forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy. The comparison between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in statistical information, temporal pressure variation, power spectrum density, spatial distribution, and spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found that embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient $\beta$ in the DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting spatiotemporal wall pressure information, in particular, in forecasting high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability</description>

      <title>Mean velocity profile in stably stratified channel turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) is a cornerstone of atmospheric science for describing turbulence in stable boundary layers. Extending MOST to stably stratified turbulent channel flows, however, is non-trivial due to confinement by solid walls and the much smaller turbulent length scales involved. In this study, we investigate the applicability of MOST in closed channels and identify where and to what extent the theory remains valid. A key finding is that the ratio of the half-channel height to the Obukhov length serves as a governing parameter for identifying distinct flow regions and determining the scaling of the mean velocity within them. Hence, we propose a closure relation to estimate this ratio directly from the governing input parameters: friction Reynolds and friction Richardson numbers ($Re_{\tau}$ and $Ri_{\tau}$). The framework is tested against a series of direct numerical simulations (DNS) across a range of $Re_{\tau}$ and $Ri_{\tau}$. The reconstructed velocity profiles enable accurate prediction of the skin friction coefficient crucial for quantifying pressure losses in stratified flows in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>The coherent structures of EVP Fluid Flow Past a Circular Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of elasticity and plasticity on two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds number $Re = 100$. Ten direct numerical simulations were performed using the Saramito-Herschel-Bulkley model to represent viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids. The flow evolves from a periodic von K\'arm\'an vortex street to chaotic-like regimes. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) are applied to extract dominant flow structures and their temporal dynamics. For viscoelastic fluids, increasing the Weissenberg number $Wi$ elongates the recirculation bubble and shifts it downstream, resulting in more intricate but still periodic behavior. In EVP fluids, seven cases explore variations in Bingham number Bn, solvent viscosity ratio $\beta_s$, and power law index n, aiming to qualitatively assess their influence rather than determine critical thresholds. Results indicate that stronger plastic effects, especially with n&gt;1, lead to increased flow complexity. Three dynamic regimes are identified: (i) periodic; (ii) transitional, with elongated recirculation and disrupted periodicity; and (iii) fully complex, with breakdown of recirculation. Overall, the study highlights the interplay between inertia, elasticity, and yield stress in non-Newtonian flows past obstacles and identifies key parameters driving the transition from periodic to complex regimes.</description>

      <title>Extending the Duchon-Robert framework for anomalous dissipation to compressible fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous dissipation, the persistence of a finite mean kinetic energy dissipation as the Reynolds number tends to infinity, occurs in flows with sufficiently spatially rough velocity fields. Compressible turbulence adds further anomalous dissipation mechanisms, which we investigate in this work. To this end, the Duchon-Robert framework (DR) for anomalous dissipation is extended from the incompressible to the compressible Navier-Stokes flow case. We obtain three integral dissipation terms, two anomalous and a viscous one, which arise from the pressure-dilatation and density variations, differently from the incompressible case. Subsequently, fully compressible one-dimensional flows with traveling and mutually crossing shock waves are analysed in detail. In such flows, DR reveals a local maximum of anomalous dissipation at the shock front. Furthermore, DR is compared with a coarse-grain cascade theory of compressible turbulence due to Aluie (AL) and the relevant dissipation flux terms of both frameworks are identified and compared with each other. The comparison shows that each contribution related to the compressibility effects in DR has its analogue in AL. Finally, a piecewise linear shock-type velocity profile, which approximates the crossing of two shock waves from the simulations, is used for an analytical analysis of the anomalous dissipation terms of DR to analyse the dependence of the terms on the local H\"older exponent. Our work is a first step towards a comparison of coherent flow structures in a compressible turbulent flow and related anomalous dissipation.</description>

      <title>Optimal velocity fields for instantaneous magnetic field growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the kinematic dynamo problem. Rather than prescribing a velocity field and searching for high-growth magnetic fields via an eigenvalue problem, we treat the seed magnetic-field structure as given and ask which velocity field maximally enhances its instantaneous growth. We show this second problem has an elegant formulation in terms of variational calculus. Upon simultaneously constraining the velocity's kinetic energy and enstrophy, the Euler-Lagrange equation leads to a forced Helmholtz partial differential equation (PDE) for the optimal velocity field. For the special case of fixed kinetic energy and unconstrained enstrophy, the optimal velocity field everywhere opposes the divergence-free projection of the Lorentz force. In the more general setting, the optimal velocity field can be found through numerical solution of the forced Helmholtz PDE.</description>

      <title>Diffusive behavior of transport noise on $\mathbb{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02707v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically and numerically transport noise-induced diffusion in flows on the sphere. Previous analysis on the torus demonstrated that suitably chosen transport noise in the Euler equations leads to diffusive behavior resembling the Navier--Stokes equations. Here, we analyze dynamics on the sphere with noise-induced differential elliptic operator dissipation and characterize their energy and enstrophy decay properties. Through structure-preserving numerical simulations with the Zeitlin discretization, we demonstrate that appropriately scaled transport noise induces energy dissipation while preserving enstrophy and coadjoint orbits. The presented analysis lays a groundwork for further theoretical investigation of transport noise and supports the calibration of transport noise models as a parametrization for unresolved processes in geophysical fluid simulations.</description>

      <title>Spline Shallow Water Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced models for free-surface flows are required due to the high dimensionality of the underlying incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which need to fully resolve the flow in vertical direction to compute the surface height. On the other hand, standard reduced models, such as the classical Shallow Water Equations (SWE), which assume a small depth-to-length ratio and use depth-averaging, do not provide information about the vertical velocity profile variations. As a compromise, a recently proposed moment approach for shallow flow using Legendre polynomials as ansatz functions for vertical velocity variations showed the derivation of so-called Shallow Water Moment Equations (SWME) that combine low dimensionality with velocity profile modeling. However, only global polynomials are considered so far.
  This paper introduces Spline Shallow Water Moment Equations (SSWME) where piecewise defined spline ansatz functions allow for a flexible representation of velocity profiles with lower regularity. The local support of the spline basis functions opens up the possibility of adaptability and greater flexibility regarding some typical profile shapes. We systematically derive and analyze hierarchies of SSWME models with different number of basis functions and different degrees, before deriving a regularized hyperbolic version by performing a hyperbolic regularization with analytical proof of hyperbolicity for a hierarchy of high-order SSWME models. Numerical simulations show high accuracy and robustness of the new models.</description>

      <title>A fluid--peridynamic structure model of deformation and damage of microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft-walled microchannels arise in many applications, ranging from organ-on-a-chip platforms to soft-robotic actuators. However, despite extensive research on their static and dynamic response, the potential failure of these devices has not been addressed. To this end, we explore fluid--structure interaction in microchannels whose compliant top wall is governed by a nonlocal mechanical theory capable of simulating both deformation and material failure. We develop a one-dimensional model by coupling viscous flow under the lubrication approximation to a state-based peridynamic formulation of an Euler--Bernoulli beam. The peridynamic formulation enables the wall to be modeled as a genuinely nonlocal beam, and the integral form of its equation of motion remains valid whether the deformation field is smooth or contains discontinuities. Through the proposed computational model, we explore the steady and time-dependent behaviors of this fluid--peridynamic structure interaction. We rationalize the wave and damping dynamics observed in the simulations through a dispersion (linearized) analysis of the coupled system, finding that, with increasing nonlocal influence, wave propagation exhibits a clear departure from classical behavior, characterized by a gradual suppression of the phase velocity. The main contribution of our study is to outline the potential failure scenarios of the microchannel's soft wall under the hydrodynamic load of the flow. Specifically, we find a dividing curve in the space spanned by the dimensionless Strouhal number (quantifying unsteady inertia of the beam) and the compliance number (quantifying the strength of the fluid--structure coupling) separating scenarios of potential failure during transient conditions from potential failure at the steady load.</description>

      <title>A matrix preconditioning framework for physics-informed neural networks based on adjoint method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a popular approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). Compared to fully connected neural networks, PINNs based on convolutional neural networks offer advantages in the hard enforcement of boundary conditions and in reducing the computational cost of partial derivatives. However, the latter still struggles with slow convergence and even failure in some scenarios. In this study, we propose a matrix preconditioning method to improve the convergence of the latter. Specifically, we combine automatic differentiation with matrix coloring to compute the Jacobian matrix of the PDE system, which is used to construct the preconditioner via incomplete LU factorization. We subsequently use the preconditioner to scale the PDE residual in the loss function in order to reduce the condition number of the Jacobian matrix, which is key to improving the convergence of PINNs. To overcome the incompatibility between automatic differentiation and triangular solves in the preconditioning, we also design a framework based on the adjoint method to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. By numerical experiments, we validate that the proposed method successfully and efficiently solves the multi-scale problem and the high Reynolds number problem, in both of which PINNs fail to obtain satisfactory results.</description>

      <title>Local three-dimensional simulations of the convective overstability in protoplanetary discs</title>

Abstract: At certain radii protoplanetary discs may sustain a form of oscillatory convection (`convective overstability'; COS) due to localised adverse entropy gradients. The resulting hydrodynamical activity can produce coherent structures, such as zonal flows and vortices, that may concentrate solid material and aid their further coagulation. In this paper we extend previous axisymmetric runs by performing local three-dimensional simulations of the COS, using the code SNOOPY. As parameters are varied, we characterise how the various axisymmetric COS saturated states are transformed in 3D, while also tracking their interrelationship with the subcritical baroclinic instability. In particular, at low Reynolds number (Re) our 3D simulations exhibit similar weakly nonlinear and wave turbulent states to our earlier axisymmetic runs. At higher Re, but low Peclet number (Pe), we obtain bursty cycles involving the creation of zonal flows, the subsequent development of planar vortices, and their destruction by elliptical instability. For larger Pe, however, zonal flows can persist, alongside weaker more elongated vortices. These results further reveal the diversity of the COS's behaviour, and show that solid accumulation via COS-induced vortices may not be straightforward.</description>

      <title>Impact of the history force on the motion of droplets in shaken liquids</title>

Abstract: Droplets and solid particles in unsteady flows are affected by the Basset-Boussinesq history force (BBH), in addition to stationary viscous friction, inertia, and gravity. The BBH is often neglected, not because this is generally justified, but because its inclusion in calculations is usually difficult. To assess the significance of BBH for particle dynamics, we revisit unsteady Stokes flows around spherical particles or droplets and derive from first-principles the analytical expressions for the velocity around the particles and the forces acting on them. This includes the case of time-varying radii for gas bubbles and also graphical representations of how the BBH force arises from transient, diffusion-driven vortex structures around particles. Applying these results to sedimentation of heavy or rising light particles or droplets in horizontally shaken fluids (i.e., periodically accelerated), we find that within certain parameter ranges, BBH can reduce the particle deflection amplitude by more than 60\% relative to the fluid motion. Our (analytical) results show that the BBH effects become large in the transition region between the low-frequency viscous Stokes regime and the regime dominated by high-frequency inertia. On this basis, we also derive a power law for the amplitude of the periodic particle displacement, which can be unambiguously attributed to the BBH and directly identified in experiments. For light particles such as gas bubbles, the dominant contribution to inertial forces comes from the added mass, and the BBH acting on gas bubbles is more important for their dynamics than in the case of heavy particles such as droplets in air or metal beads in water.</description>

      <title>Theoretical estimate and characteristics of electro-vortex flows in cylindrical electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02297</link>

Abstract: Electro-vortex flows (EVF) arise in conducting fluids due to diverging current lines and the non-conservative Lorentz force. They are typically characterized by the $S$ parameter, defined as $S=\mu _0 I^2/4\pi^2 \rho \nu^2$, where it is known that $Re \sim \sqrt{S}$ for large currents. However, the strength of the EVF in a confined cylindrical domain with a co-axially placed current collector (CC) depends also on the ratio of the CC radius to the cylinder radius, $K=r_0/R$, in addition to the current magnitude, $I$, fluid density, $\rho$ and kinematic viscosity, $\nu$. For high $Re$, using the vorticity transport equation, we derive a new theoretical estimate of the r.m.s. EVF velocity and find that $u \propto I (1-K)/\sqrt{K}$. We validate our estimate with numerical simulations using our custom-built code in \textsc{OpenFOAM} for $K\in[0.1,0.7]$ and $I\in[30,555]$A. In addition, for the same range, we compare our numerical results with the estimates of maximum EVF velocity available in the literature. We also discuss the EVF characteristics for varying $K$ using the vorticity dynamics. Finally, we also propose a \emph{modified} EVF parameter ($S_M \propto S (1-K)^2/{K}$) based on our velocity estimate that includes $K$. Our results suggest that the scaling relationship should actually be $Re \sim \sqrt{S_M}$.</description>

      <title>Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction Dynamics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Immersed Boundary Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce neural network architectures that combine physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the immersed boundary method (IBM) to solve fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. Our approach features two distinct architectures: a Single-FSI network with a unified parameter space, and an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian network that maintains separate parameter spaces for fluid and structure domains. We study each architecture using standard Tanh and adaptive B-spline activation functions. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that the Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture performs significantly better. The adaptive B-spline activation further enhances accuracy by providing locality-aware representation near boundaries. While our methodology shows promising results in predicting the velocity field, pressure recovery remains challenging due to the absence of explicit force-coupling constraints in the current formulation. Our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific architectural design and adaptive activation functions for modeling FSI problems within the PINN framework.</description>
