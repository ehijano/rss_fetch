      <title>Thawed Gaussian wavepacket dynamics with $\Delta$-machine learned potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for performing variable-width (thawed) Gaussian wavepacket (GWP) variational dynamics on machine-learned potentials is presented. Instead of fitting the potential energy surface (PES), the anharmonic correction to the global harmonic approximation (GHA) is fitted using kernel ridge regression -- this is a $\Delta$-machine learning approach. The training set consists of energy differences between ab initio electronic energies and values given by the GHA. The learned potential is subsequently used to propagate a single thawed GWP using the time-dependent variational principle to compute the autocorrelation function, which provides direct access to vibronic spectra via its Fourier transform. We applied the developed method to simulate the photoelectron spectrum of ammonia and found excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra. We show that fitting the anharmonic corrections requires a smaller training set as compared to fitting total electronic energies. We also demonstrate that our approach allows to reduce the dimensionality of the nuclear space used to scan the PES when constructing the training set. Thus, only the degrees of freedom associated with large amplitude motions need to be treated with $\Delta$-machine learning, which paves a way for reliable simulations of vibronic spectra of large floppy molecules.</description>

      <title>A simple truth hidden in plain sight: All molecules are entangled according to chemical common sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equation that determines the numbers of electrons for molecules is proposed based on chemical common sense. It shows that all molecules are entangled in number of electrons and results in the fundamental assumption of molecular energy convexity that underpins molecular quantum mechanics. It also leads to the concept of fractional numbers of electrons for molecules in a statistical sense. The energy of a molecule is piecewise linear with respect to its continuous number of electrons. Wavefunction interpretation of this equation of nature shows that an individual molecule with noninteger number of electrons is locally physical, whereas a molecule with integer number of electrons is locally real. The complete theoretical proof of the equation is still to be had.</description>

      <title>Beyond a Richardson-Gaudin mean-field: Slater-Condon rules and perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Richardson-Gaudin states provide a basis of the Hilbert space for strongly correlated electrons. In this study, optimal expressions for the transition density matrix elements between Richardson-Gaudin states are obtained with a cost comparable with the corresponding reduced density matrix elements. Analogues of the Slater-Condon rules are identified based on the number of near-zero singular values of the RG state overlap matrix. Finally, a perturbative approach is shown to be close in quality to a configuration interaction of Richardson-Gaudin states while being feasible to compute.</description>

      <title>Canonized then Minimized RMSD for Three-Dimensional Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing molecular canonization algorithms typically operate on one-dimensional (1D) string representations or two-dimensional (2D) connectivity graphs of a molecule and are not able to differentiate equivalent atoms based on three-dimensional (3D) structures. The stereochemical tags on each atom are in fact determined according to established Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules for comparing grades, which can help to further differentiate atoms with similar environment. Therefore, a stereochemical-rule-based canonization algorithm that is capable of assigning canonical indices using 3D structural information is of great value. On top of the Schneider-Sayle-Landrum (SSL) partition-based canonization algorithm, we propose an enhanced canonization algorithm to expand its applicability. The initial index assignment rules are redesigned, so that the obtained canonical indices are compatible with the most of the common CIP Sequence Rules, which greatly eases the stereochemical assignment. Furthermore, a branching tiebreaking step is added to secure an accurate evaluation of the structural difference through the minimized root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between structures, with an option to include hydrogen atoms or not. Our algorithm is implemented with Python and can efficiently obtain minimized RMSD taking into account of the symmetry of molecular systems , contributing to the fields of drug design, molecular docking, and data analysis of molecular dynamics simulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum rates in dissipative systems with spatially varying friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether making the friction spatially dependent introduces quantum effects into the thermal reaction rates for dissipative reactions. We calculate the quantum rates using the numerically exact multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, as well as the approximate ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), ring-polymer instanton (RPI) methods, and classical mechanics. By conducting simulations across a wide range of temperatures and friction strengths, we can identify the various regimes that govern the reactive dynamics. At high temperatures, in addition to the spatial-diffusion and energy-diffusion regimes predicted by Kramer's rate theory, a (coherent) tunnelling-dominated regime is identified at low friction. At low temperatures, incoherent tunnelling dominates most of Kramer's curve, except at very low friction when coherent tunnelling becomes dominant. Unlike in classical mechanics, the bath's influence changes the equilibrium time-independent properties of the system, leading to a complex interplay between spatially dependent friction and nuclear quantum effects even at high temperatures. More specifically, we show that a realistic friction profile can lead to an increase (decrease) of the quantum (classical) rates with friction within the spatial-diffusion regime, showing that classical and quantum rates display qualitatively different behaviours. Except at very low frictions, we find that RPMD captures most of the quantum effects in the thermal reaction rates.</description>

      <title>Electronic Coherences in Molecules: The Projected Nuclear Quantum Momentum as a Hidden Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic coherences are key to understanding and controlling photo-induced molecular transformations. We identify a crucial quantum-mechanical feature of electron-nuclear correlation, the projected nuclear quantum momenta, essential to capture the correct coherence behavior. In simulations, we show that, unlike traditional trajectory-based schemes, exact-factorization-based methods approximate these correlation terms, and correctly capture electronic coherences in a range of situations, including their spatial dependence, an important aspect that influences subsequent electron dynamics and that is becoming accessible in more experiments.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of Coherent versus spontaneous Raman Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their sub picosecond temporal resolution, coherent Raman spectroscopies have been proposed as a viable extension of Spontaneous Raman (SR) thermometry, to determine dynamics of mode specific vibrational energy content during out of equilibrium molecular processes. Here we show that the presence of multiple laser fields stimulating the vibrational coherences introduces additional quantum pathways, resulting in destructive interference. This ultimately reduces the thermal sensitivity of single spectral lines, nullifying it for harmonic vibrations and temperature independent polarizability. We demonstrate how harnessing anharmonic signatures such as vibrational hot bands enables coherent Raman thermometry.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Hund's rule in the Chemical Space of Small Organic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embark on a quest to identify small molecules in the chemical space that can potentially violate Hund's rule. Utilizing twelve TDDFT approximations and the ADC(2) many-body method, we report the energies of S$_1$ and T$_1$ excited states of 12,880 closed-shell organic molecules within the bigQM7$\omega$ dataset with up to 7 CONF atoms. In this comprehensive dataset, none of the molecules, in their minimum energy geometry, exhibit a negative S$_1$-T$_1$ energy gap at the ADC($2$) level while several molecules display values $&lt;0.1$ eV. The spin-component-scaled double-hybrid method, SCS-PBE-QIDH, demonstrates the best agreement with ADC(2). Yet, at this level, a few molecules with a strained $sp^3$-N center turn out as false-positives with the S$_1$ state lower in energy than T$_1$. We investigate a prototypical cage molecule with an energy gap $&lt;-0.2$ eV, which a closer examination revealed as another false positive. We conclude that in the chemical space of small closed-shell organic molecules, it is possible to identify geometric and electronic structural features giving rise to S$_1$-T$_1$ degeneracy; still, there is no evidence of a negative gap. We share the dataset generated for this study as a module, to facilitate seamless molecular discovery through data mining.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics enabled through variational interpolation of correlated electron wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body basis of different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain, with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12,000 geometries with provable convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum support vector machines for classification and regression on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a rapidly growing field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. In this work, we examine our quantum machine learning models, which are based on quantum support vector classification (QSVC) and quantum support vector regression (QSVR). We investigate these models using a quantum-circuit simulator, both with and without noise, as well as the IonQ Harmony quantum processor. For the QSVC tasks, we use a dataset containing fraudulent credit card transactions and image datasets (the MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets); for the QSVR tasks, we use a financial dataset and a materials dataset. For the classification tasks, the performance of our QSVC models using 4 qubits of the trapped-ion quantum computer was comparable to that obtained from noiseless quantum-circuit simulations. The result is consistent with the analysis of our device-noise simulations with varying qubit-gate error rates. For the regression tasks, applying a low-rank approximation to the noisy quantum kernel, in combination with hyperparameter tuning in {\epsilon}-SVR, improved the performance of the QSVR models on the near-term quantum device. The alignment, as measured by the Frobenius inner product between the noiseless and noisy quantum kernels, can serve as an indicator of the relative prediction performance on noisy quantum devices in comparison with their ideal counterparts. Our results suggest that the quantum kernel, as described by our shallow quantum circuit, can be effectively used for both QSVC and QSVR tasks, indicating its resistance to noise and its adaptability to various datasets.</description>
