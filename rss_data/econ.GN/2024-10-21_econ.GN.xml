      <title>Approximating Auction Equilibria with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for computing equilibria in auctions become computationally intractable as auction complexity increases, particularly in multi-item and dynamic auctions. This paper introduces a self-play based reinforcement learning approach that employs advanced algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization and Neural Fictitious Self-Play to approximate Bayes-Nash equilibria. This framework allows for continuous action spaces, high-dimensional information states, and delayed payoffs. Through self-play, these algorithms can learn robust and near-optimal bidding strategies in auctions with known equilibria, including those with symmetric and asymmetric valuations, private and interdependent values, and multi-round auctions.</description>

      <title>Modeling the transition from pay-as-you-go to a fully funded pension system in Russia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In countries with a growing number of elderly and a shrinking workforce, one of which is Russia, it becomes impossible to maintain a solidary pension system and a need to switch to a more stable funded system appears. This paper analyzes various scenarios of Russia's transition to such a system. This is the first study on the Russian economy in which an Overlapping Generations Model is used to simulate the pension transition. It is demonstrated that in the long term, the transition to a funded system slightly reduces the welfare of pensioners, and during the transition, the situation of pensioners deteriorates strongly. However, it is also important to emphasize that the transition imposes a heavy burden on all generations living during the reform, they are forced to consume less and greatly change their savings, while also often starting to work more. Such conclusions are made concerning average population cohorts, and the results may not be the same for different groups of individuals within these cohorts. In different scenarios, the pension system transition can cause both economic growth and economic recession, as well as a corresponding increase or decrease in wages and consumption.</description>

Abstract: Net profit is sometimes found from data for net operating surplus. We propose a way to find it from data for consumption, pay and market-value capital, and concomitantly to reveal the factor shares in consumption.</description>

      <title>Divide and Diverge: Polarization Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study polarization in a probabilistic voting model with aggregate shocks and a decreasing marginal utility from office rents. In equilibrium, parties offer different policies, despite being rent-motivated and ex-ante identical from the point of view of voters. When candidates compete on a single policy issue, parties' equilibrium payoffs increase in voter polarization, even when the change is driven by the supporters of the opposite party becoming more extreme. With multiple policy issues, parties benefit if the society is split into two factions and the ideological cohesion within such factions increases. We connect our results to empirical evidence on polarizing political communication, party identity, and zero-sum thinking, and find that polarization could be reduced by intervening on the electoral rule.</description>
