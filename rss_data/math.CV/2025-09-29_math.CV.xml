      <title>The Range of the Monge-Amp\`ere operator $(\omega + dd^c .)^n$ in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain of $\mathbb{C}^n$. We solve degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations of the form $(\omega + dd^c \varphi)^n = \mu$ in the generalized Cegrell classes $\mathcal{K}(\Omega,\omega,H)$, where $H \in \mathcal{E}(\Omega)$ is maximal, $\omega$ is a smooth real $(1,1)$-form defined in a neighborhood of $\bar\Omega$ and $\mu$ is a positive Radon measure. This generalizes the previous work of the last author \cite{Sal25} to the case of non-continuous functions $H$ and also to the case of measures $\mu$ which do not vanish on pluripolar sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the bialgebraic varieties of the $\Gamma$ function, that is, if $V,W\subseteq\mathbb{C}^n$ are irreducible affine algebraic variety which satisfy $\dim V =\dim W$ and $\Gamma(V)\subseteq W$, then the equations defining $V$ (and hence also $W$) either give an equality between coordinates, or set some coordinates to be constant.</description>

      <title>Uniform \emph{a priori} bounds for neutral renormalization. Variation~\RN{2}: $\psi^\bullet$-ql Siegel maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend uniform pseudo-Siegel bounds for neutral quadratic polynomials to $\psi^\bullet$-quadratic-like Siegel maps. In this form, the bounds are compatible with the $\psi$-quadratic-like renormalization theory and are easily transferable to various families of rational maps. The main theorem states that the degeneration of a Siegel disk is equidistributed among combinatorial intervals. This provides a precise description of how the $\psi^\bullet$-quadratic-like structure degenerates around the Siegel disk on all geometric scales except on the ``transitional scales'' between two specific combinatorial levels.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation in Cooperative Mid-band/THz Networks in the Presence of Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework to investigate and optimize the downlink performance of cooperative multi-band networks (MBNs) operating on upper mid-band (UMB) and terahertz (THz) frequencies, where base stations (BSs) in each band cooperatively serve users. The framework captures sophisticated features such as near-field channel modeling, fully and partially connected antenna architectures, and users' mobility. First, we consider joint user association and hybrid beamforming optimization to maximize the system sum-rate, subject to power constraints, maximum cluster size of cooperating BSs, and users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By leveraging fractional programming FP and majorization-minimization techniques, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem. We then consider handover (HO)-aware resource allocation for moving users in a cooperative UMB/THz MBN. Two HO-aware resource allocation methods are proposed. The first method focuses on maximizing the HO-aware system sum-rate subject to HO-aware QoS constraints. Using Jensen's inequality and properties of logarithmic functions, the non-convex optimization problem is tightly approximated with a convex one and solved. The second method addresses a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the system sum-rate, while minimizing the total number of HOs. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, cooperative UMB/THz MBN over stand-alone THz networks, as well as the critical importance of accurate near-field modeling in extremely large antenna arrays. Moreover, the proposed HO-aware resource allocation methods effectively mitigate the impact of HOs, enhancing performance in the considered system.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic contact symplectic lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a complex manifold $M$ endowed with a holomorphic contact structure $V$, one can define a sub-Finsler pseudometric through holomorphic discs tangent to $V$. If the integrated pseudodistance is a distance, then $M$ is $V$-hyperbolic, a generalisation of Kobayashi hyperbolicity.
  In this paper, we focus on Reeb manifolds $M$, which are contact manifolds with a free holomorphic $\mathbb{C}$-action generated by a Reeb vector field. We show that every proper Reeb manifold is the total space of a {\sl contact symplectic lift}, that is, it admits a $\mathbb C$-principal bundle structure onto a complex manifold $S$ endowed with a $C^\infty$-exact holomorphic symplectic form $\omega$ so that the pull back of $\omega$ is related to the contact structure $V$ of $M$. Conversely, we prove that any $C^\infty$-exact holomorphic symplectic manifold is given as the base of a contact symplectic lift.
  We also prove that $M$ is (complete) $V$-hyperbolic if and only if $S$ is (complete) Kobayashi hyperbolic. This yields many new examples of $V$-hyperbolic manifolds.
  Finally, we study the automorphism group ${\sf Aut}_V M$ of those automorphisms of $M$ preserving $V$. In case $M$ is $V$-hyperbolic, this is a finite-dimensional Lie group, and we provide a classification in dimension $3$, where $2 \leq \dim_{\mathbb{R}} {\sf Aut}_V M \leq 7$, with the extremal upper case realised uniquely (up to natural equivalences) by the contact symplectic lift of the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^2$ endowed with the symplectic form $\frac{2}{(1-z)^3} dz \wedge dw$.</description>

      <title>The Oka principle in higher twisted K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Oka principle is a heuristic in complex geometry which states that, for a wide class of complex-analytic problems concerning Stein spaces, any obstruction to finding a holomorphic solution is purely topological. A classical theorem of H.~Grauert implies that for a reduced Stein space $X$, the natural map $K^{0, \mathcal{O}}(X) \to K^{0, \mathcal{C}}(X)$ from ordinary holomorphic K-theory $K^{0, \mathcal{O}}(X)$ to ordinary topological K-theory $K^{0, \mathcal{C}}(X)$ is an isomorphism: this is the basic manifestation of the Oka principle in K-theory. In this paper, we generalise this theorem to higher twisted K-theory. For a reduced Stein space $X$ and a torsion class $\alpha \in H^3(X,\mathbb{Z})$, we prove that the natural map $K^{-n,\mathcal{O}}_\alpha(X) \to K^{-n,\mathcal{C}}_\alpha(X)$ is an isomorphism for all $n \geq 0$. We introduce the first definition of higher twisted holomorphic K-theory in the literature, defined through a simplicially enriched version of Quillen's $S^{-1}S$ construction. Our parallel construction for topological higher twisted K-theory is a new formulation which is compatible with existing theory. The proof of the main theorem employs Cartan-Grauert cohomological methods and an equivalence, which we prove, between the simplicial symmetric monoidal categories of holomorphic and topological $\alpha$-twisted vector bundles.</description>

      <title>Function theory on the annulus in the dp-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we shall use realization theory to prove new results about a class of holomorphic functions on an annulus \[R_\delta \stackrel{\rm def}{=} \{z \in \mathbb{C}: \delta &lt;|z|&lt;1\},\] where $0&lt;\delta&lt;1$. The class of functions in question arises in the early work of R. G. Douglas and V. I. Paulsen on the rational dilation of a Hilbert space operator $T$ to a normal operator with spectrum in $\partial R_\delta$. Their work suggested the following norm $\|\cdot\|_{\mathrm{dp}}$ on the space $\mathrm{Hol}(R_\delta)$ of holomorphic functions on $R_\delta$, \[ \|\phi\|_{\mathrm{dp}} \stackrel{\rm def}{=} \sup\{ \|\phi(T)\|: \|T\|\leq 1, \|T^{-1} \|\leq 1/\delta \ \text{and} \ \sigma(T)\subseteq R_\delta\}.\] By analogy with the classical Schur class of holomorphic functions $\mathcal{S} $ with supremum norm at most $1$ on the disc $\mathbb{D}$, it is natural to consider the dp-Schur class $\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{dp}$ of holomorphic functions of dp-norm at most $1$ on $R_\delta$.
  Our central result is a Pick interpolation theorem for functions in $\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{dp}$ that is analogous to Abrahamse's Interpolation Theorem for bounded holomorphic functions on a multiply-connected domain. For a tuple $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$ of distinct interpolation nodes in $R_\delta$, we introduce a special set $\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm {dp}}(\lambda)$ of positive definite $n\times n$ matrices, which we call DP Szeg\H{o} kernels. The DP Pick problem $\lambda_j \mapsto z_j, j=1,\dots,n$, is shown to be solvable if and only if, \[ [(1-\bar z_i z_j)g_{ij}] \ge 0 \; \text{ for all}\; g \in \mathcal{G}_{\mathrm {dp}} (\lambda).\] We prove further that a solvable DP Pick problem has a solution which is a rational function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that all non-trivial solutions of a broad class of nonlinear dispersive equations, whose linear evolution is governed by a dispersion relation under minimal regularity assumptions, cannot remain compactly supported for any non-trivial time interval. Our approach, based on complex-analytic arguments and the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem, yields a stronger result: if linear solutions are compactly supported at two distinct times, then the dispersion relation must admit an analytic extension. This extends previous results beyond polynomial dispersion relations and applies to more general settings, including fractional-order systems. As an application, we examine the generalized space-time fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation, illustrating the role of memory effects in wave propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal C}$ be a fixed equisingularity class of irreducible germs of complex analytic plane curves. We compute a basis of the ${\mathbb C}[[x]]$-module of K\"ahler differentials for generic $\Gamma \in {\mathcal C}$, algorithmically, and study its behaviour under blow-up.
  As a first application, we give an algorithm providing the generic semimodule in an equisingularity class in terms of its multiplicity and its Puiseux characteristic exponents. As another application, we give an alternative proof for a formula of Genzmer, that provides the dimension of the moduli of analytic classes in the equisingularity class of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials for measures that are differentiable, but not necessarily analytic, multiplicative perturbations of Jacobi-like measures supported on disjoint intervals. We analyze the Fokas--Its--Kitaev Riemann--Hilbert problem using the Deift--Zhou method of nonlinear steepest descent and its $\bar \partial$ extension due to Miller and McLaughlin. Our results extend that of Yattselev in the case of Chebyshev-like measures with error bounds that give similar rates while allowing less regular perturbations. For the general Jacobi-like case, we present, what appears to be the first result for asymptotics when the perturbation of the measure is only assumed to be differentiable with bounded second derivative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the 1970s, it has been known that any open connected manifold of dimension 2, 4 or 6 admits a complex analytic structure whenever its tangent bundle admits a complex linear structure. For half a century, this has been conjectured to hold true for manifolds of any dimension. In this paper, we extend the result to manifolds of dimension 8 and 10. The result is proved by applying Gromov's h-principle in order to adapt a method of Haefliger, originally used to study foliations, to the holomorphic setting. For dimension 12 and greater, the conjecture remains open.</description>

      <title>Envelope of Holomorphy of Matsuki Orbits in Complex Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.</description>

      <title>Computing the Topological Degree of Maps Between 2-Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an effective method for computing the topological degree of continuous functions $R:S^2 \to S^2$, where $S^2$ is the Riemann sphere. Our approach generalizes the degree formula for rational functions of complex polynomials, $\frac{f}{g}$, without common zeros. To apply our method, it is necessary to represent the function $R$ as the ratio of two continuous complex-valued functions $f$ and $g$ without common zeros. By utilizing Hopf fibration, this method reduces the problem to computing the winding number of a loop. This enables us to compute the degree of $\frac{f}{g}$ even when $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary continuous complex functions without common zeros, and the fraction has a limit at infinity (which can be finite or infinite). Specifically, if $f$ and $g$ are complex polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$, and the highest-degree homogeneous component of the polynomial with the greater algebraic degree has a finite or infinite limit as $|z|\to\infty$, then the problem reduces to counting the roots of a complex polynomial inside the unit circle, obtained from this component.</description>
