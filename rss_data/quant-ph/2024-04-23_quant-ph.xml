      <title>Virtual quantum resource distillation: General framework and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the general framework of virtual resource distillation -- an alternative distillation strategy proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 050203 (2024)], which extends conventional quantum resource distillation by integrating the power of classical postprocessing. The framework presented here is applicable not only to quantum states, but also dynamical quantum objects such as quantum channels and higher-order processes. We provide a general characterization and benchmarks for the performance of virtual resource distillation in the form of computable semidefinite programs as well as several operationally motivated quantities. We apply our general framework to various concrete settings of interest, including standard resource theories such as entanglement, coherence, and magic, as well as settings involving dynamical resources such as quantum memory, quantum communication, and non-Markovian dynamics. The framework of probabilistic distillation is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Completing the Quantum Reconstruction Program via the Relativity Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain how the disparate kinematics of quantum mechanics (finite-dimensional Hilbert space of QM) and special relativity (Minkowski spacetime from the Lorentz transformations of SR) can both be based on one principle (relativity principle). This is made possible by the axiomatic reconstruction of QM via information-theoretic principles, which has successfully recast QM as a principle theory a la SR. That is, in the quantum reconstruction program (QRP) and SR, the formalisms (Hilbert space and Lorentz transformations, respectively) are derived from empirically discovered facts (Information Invariance &amp; Continuity and light postulate, respectively), so QM and SR are "principle theories" as defined by Einstein. While SR has a compelling fundamental principle to justify its empirically discovered fact (relativity principle), QRP has not produced a compelling fundamental principle or causal mechanism to account for its empirically discovered fact. To unify these disparate kinematics, we show how the relativity principle ("no preferred reference frame" NPRF) can also be used to justify Information Invariance &amp; Continuity. We do this by showing that when QRP's operational notion of measurement is spatialized, Information Invariance &amp; Continuity entails the empirically discovered fact that everyone measures the same value for Planck's constant h, regardless of their relative spatial orientations or locations (Planck postulate). Since Poincare transformations relate inertial reference frames via spatial rotations and translations as well as boosts, the relativity principle justifies the Planck postulate just like it justifies the light postulate. Essentially, NPRF + c is an adynamical global constraint over the spacetime configuration of worldtubes for bodily objects while NPRF + h is an adynamical global constraint over the distribution of quanta among those bodily objects.</description>

      <title>Measurable Krylov Spaces and Eigenenergy Count in Quantum State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a new Krylov space for the time evolution of a quantum state, which is both quantum-mechanically measurable. Based on our defined spaces, an effective dimension is introduced that provides insight into how expressive the quantum system is. The understanding of the time evolution operator as a map onto a Krylov space is evident from the Taylor expansion of said operator. Current literature focuses on computing different powers of the Hamiltonian to construct a basis for the Krylov state space. One challenge this approach faces is that computing higher powers of the Hamiltonian becomes increasingly difficult for larger systems. Since each basis state is constructed from a different power of the Hamiltonian, the basis states have varying lengths, making the ortho-normalization process challenging. Furthermore, computing high powers of the Hamiltonian increases rounding errors, which can lead to a wrongly increased Krylov space dimension. The first part of our work challenges these issues by defining an equivalent space, where the original basis consists of states of the same length. We demonstrate that a set of different time-evolved states can be used to construct a basis. We subsequently verify the results through numerical analysis, demonstrating that every time-evolved state can be reconstructed using the defined vector space. Based on this new space, we define an effective dimension and analyze its influence on finite-dimensional systems. Our method gives insight into the basis construction of the time evolution operator, which can be computed experimentally. We further show that the Krylov space dimension is equal to the number of pairwise distinct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, enabling a method to determine the number of eigenenergies the system has experimentally.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum computing for clinical trial design and optimization: A perspective on new opportunities and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical trials are pivotal in the drug discovery process to determine the safety and efficacy of a drug candidate. The high failure rates of these trials are attributed to deficiencies in clinical model development and protocol design. Improvements in the clinical drug design process could therefore yield significant benefits for all stakeholders involved. This paper examines the current challenges faced in clinical trial design and optimization, reviews established classical computational approaches, and introduces quantum algorithms aimed at enhancing these processes. Specifically, the focus is on three critical aspects: clinical trial simulations, site selection, and cohort identification. This study aims to provide a comprehensive framework that leverages quantum computing to innovate and refine the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical trials.</description>

      <title>An application of the theta operator in generalized hypergeometric coherent states formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine one of the multiple applications of the theta operator xd/dx in quantum mechanics, namely, in the formalism of generalized hypergeometric coherent states (GHG CSs). These states are the most general coherent states, in the sense that from them, through particularization, all coherent states with physical meaning can be obtained. A series of new results were obtained and some already known ones were found / confirmed (the integral representations, as well as the Laplace transform of hypergeometric functions). To support the theoretical considerations presented above, we examined, as example, the quantum systems with a linear energy spectrum. The results obtained in this paper contribute to widening the area of applicability of the theta operator.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Quantum Computing in Materials Discovery for Direct Air Capture Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct air capture is a promising method for mitigating climate change. Solid sorbents, such as metal-organic frameworks, have been considered for this task, but their potential for deployment at scale has not been fully realized. The computational discovery of sorbent materials is a daunting task, given the vast search space, and the fact that their real-world performance depends on their ability to selectively bind CO2 molecules while avoiding other more abundant flue gas components. Quantum computing can potentially accelerate the discovery of novel materials for direct air capture as an alternative way to compute binding energies. In this work, we demonstrate methods and algorithms that enable these calculations in current quantum computing devices. We simulate the potential energy surfaces of CO2, N2, and H2O molecules at the Mg+2 metal center that represents the binding sites of typical metal-organic frameworks. We apply the qubit-ADAPT-VQE technique to run simulations on both classical and quantum hardware, and achieve reasonable accuracy while maintaining hardware efficiency, even when compared to more established methods such as UCCSD-VQE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations between quantum theory and music theory - specifically between principles of quantum computing and musical harmony - can lead to new understandings and new methodologies for music theorists and composers. The quantum principle of superposition is shown to be closely related to different interpretations of musical meaning. Superposition is implemented directly in the authors' simulations of quantum computing, as applied in the decision-making processes of computer-generated music composition.</description>

      <title>Averages in optical coherence: resolving the Magyar and Mandel-Wolf paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquity of optical coherence arising from its importance in everything from astronomy to photovoltaics means that underlying assumptions such as stationarity and ergodicity can become implicit. When these assumptions become implicit, it can appear that two different averages are independent: the finite time averaging of a detector and the ensemble average of the optical field over multiple detections. One of the two types of averaging may even be ignored. We can observe coherence as an interference fringe pattern and learn properties of the field through both methods of averaging but the coherence will not be the same, as demonstrated by the Magyar and Mandel-Wolf paradox.</description>

      <title>TANQ-Sim: Tensorcore Accelerated Noisy Quantum System Simulation via QIR on Perlmutter HPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although there have been remarkable advances in quantum computing (QC), it remains crucial to simulate quantum programs using classical large-scale parallel computing systems to validate quantum algorithms, comprehend the impact of noise, and develop resilient quantum applications. This is particularly important for bridging the gap between near-term noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum (NISQ) computing and future fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Nevertheless, current simulation methods either lack the capability to simulate noise, or simulate with excessive computational costs, or do not scale out effectively.
  In this paper, we propose TANQ-Sim, a full-scale density matrix based simulator designed to simulate practical deep circuits with both coherent and non-coherent noise. To address the significant computational cost associated with such simulations, we propose a new density-matrix simulation approach that enables TANQ-Sim to leverage the latest double-precision tensorcores (DPTCs) in NVIDIA Ampere and Hopper GPUs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of double-precision tensorcores for non-AI/ML workloads. To optimize performance, we also propose specific gate fusion techniques for density matrix simulation. For scaling, we rely on the advanced GPU-side communication library NVSHMEM and propose effective optimization methods for enhancing communication efficiency. Evaluations on the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer demonstrate the functionality, performance, and scalability of the simulator. We also present three case studies to showcase the practical usage of TANQ-Sim, including teleportation, entanglement distillation, and Ising simulation. TANQ-Sim will be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage and CSP Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-processing tasks modelled by homomorphisms between relational structures can witness quantum advantage when entanglement is used as a computational resource. We prove that the occurrence of quantum advantage is determined by the same type of algebraic structure (known as a minion) that captures the polymorphism identities of CSPs and, thus, CSP complexity. We investigate the connection between the minion of quantum advantage and other known minions controlling CSP tractability and width. In this way, we make use of complexity results from the algebraic theory of CSPs to characterise the occurrence of quantum advantage in the case of graphs, and to obtain new necessary and sufficient conditions in the case of arbitrary relational structures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Long-Distance Coherence in Critically-Driven Cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing quantum networks necessitates coherently connecting distant systems via remote strong coupling. Here, we demonstrate long-distance coherence in cavity magnonics operating in the linear regime. By locally setting the cavity near critical coupling with travelling photons, non-local magnon-photon coherence is established via strong coupling over a 2-meter distance. We observe two anomalies in this long-distance coherence: first, the coupling strength oscillates twice the period of conventional photon-mediated couplings; second, clear mode splitting is observed within the cavity linewidth. Both effects cannot be explained by conventional coupled-mode theory, which reveal the tip of an iceberg of photon-mediated coupling in systems under critical driving. Our work shows the potential of using critical phenomena for harnessing long-distance coherence in distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Lattice Surgery for Dummies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) plays a crucial role in correcting noise and paving the way for fault-tolerant quantum computing. This field has seen significant advancements, with new quantum error correction codes emerging regularly to address errors effectively. Among these, topological codes, particularly surface codes, stand out for their low error thresholds and feasibility for implementation in large-scale quantum computers. However, these codes are restricted to encoding a single qubit. Lattice surgery is crucial for enabling interactions among multiple encoded qubits or between the lattices of a surface code, ensuring that its sophisticated error-correcting features are maintained without significantly increasing the operational overhead. Lattice surgery is pivotal for scaling QECCs across more extensive quantum systems. Despite its critical importance, comprehending lattice surgery is challenging due to its inherent complexity, demanding a deep understanding of intricate quantum physics and mathematical concepts. This paper endeavors to demystify lattice surgery, making it accessible to those without a profound background in quantum physics or mathematics. This work explores surface codes, introduces the basics of lattice surgery, and demonstrates its application in building quantum gates and emulating multi-qubit circuits.</description>

      <title>Improving probabilistic error cancellation in the presence of non-stationary noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) outcomes in the presence of non-stationary noise, which is an obstacle to achieving accurate observable estimates. Leveraging Bayesian methods, we design a strategy to enhance PEC stability and accuracy. Our experiments using a 5-qubit implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and conducted on the ibm_kolkata device reveal a 42% improvement in accuracy and a 60% enhancement in stability compared to non-adaptive PEC. These results underscore the importance of adaptive estimation processes to effectively address non-stationary noise, vital for advancing PEC utility.</description>

      <title>Quantumness of gravitational cat states in correlated dephasing channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantumness of gravitational cat states in correlated dephasing channels. Our focus is on exploring how classical correlations between successive actions of a dephasing channel influence the decoherence of two gravitational cats (two qubits) at a thermal regime. The results show that the quantum coherence, local quantum Fisher information, and Bell non-locality can be significantly enhanced by augmenting classical correlations throughout the entire duration when the two qubits pass the channel. However, the gravitational interaction and energy gap between states exhibit intricate impacts on the quantum characteristics of gravitational cats. New features are reported that can be significant for both gravitational physics and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Coalescing hardcore-boson condensate states with nonzero momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), as an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, support coalescing states to be alternative stable state beyond the ground state. In this work, we explore the influence of non-Hermitian impurities on the dynamic formation of condensate states in one-, two-, and three-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard systems with strong on-site interaction. Based on the solution for the hardcore limit, we show exactly that condensate modes with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) can exist when certain system parameters satisfy specific matching conditions. Under open boundary conditions, the condensate states become coalescing states when the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric boundary gives rise to the EPs. The fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon is uncovered through analyzing the scattering dynamics of many-particle wavepackets at the non-Hermitian boundaries. The EP dynamics facilitate the dynamic generation of condensate states with non-zero momentum. To further substantiate the theoretical findings, numerical simulations are conducted. This study not only unveils the potential condensation of interacting bosons but also offers an approach for the engineering of condensate states.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous discrimination of general quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrimination of quantum operations has long been an intriguing challenge, with theoretical research significantly advancing our understanding of the quantum features in discriminating quantum objects. This challenge is closely related to the discrimination of quantum states, and proof-of-principle demonstrations of the latter have already been realized using optical photons. However, the experimental demonstration of discriminating general quantum operations, including both unitary and non-unitary operations, has remained elusive. In general quantum systems, especially those with high dimensions, the preparation of arbitrary quantum states and the implementation of arbitrary quantum operations and generalized measurements are non-trivial tasks. Here, for the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the optimal unambiguous discrimination of up to 6 displacement operators and the unambiguous discrimination of non-unitary quantum operations. Our results demonstrate powerful tools for experimental research in quantum information processing and are expected to stimulate a wide range of valuable applications in the field of quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Rabi model with two-photon relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of three light-matter interaction processes - rotating and counter-rotating interactions and two-photon relaxation of the light field - is a topic of interest in quantum optics and quantum information processing. In this work, we theoretically investigate the three light-matter interaction processes using the anisotropic Rabi model, which accounts for different strengths of rotating and counter-rotating interactions and the unique occurrence of photon escape exclusively in pairs. By numerically solving the Lindblad master equation, we analyze the excitation-relaxation dynamics and derive a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian to gain further physical insights. To explore the individual effects of these interactions, we examine three analytically tractable limits of the effective Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals that the three competitive light-matter interaction processes exhibit sensitivity to parity, leading to intriguing phenomena in both transient and steady states. Particularly interesting dynamical patterns resembling quantum phase transitions emerge when these three interaction terms compete. This work deepens the understanding of ultrastrong light-matter interaction in open quantum systems and offers valuable insights into cavity-based quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions for five examples of shunted tunneling junctions showing promise for terahertz applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used analytical methods to study the interaction of electrons with shunted models consisting of a rectangular, triangular, or delta function. potential barrier in series with a pre-barrier region at zero potential. In each model the shunted boundary conditions cause the matrix equation to have only zeros in the right-hand column vector. Thus, the determinant for each matrix must be zero for a non-trivial solution. The determinant for each model contains only the parameters (e.g. the length of the shunt, the length and height of the barrier, and the electron energy). Thus, the complete set of solutions for each model is obtained by using algebra to determine all of the points in the parameter space, and then to calculate the coefficients for each model. Any path from one point to another in the parameter space corresponds to a possible history for the operation of the model. In prototypes the shunts could be filaments of certain metals that provide quasi-coherent electron transport over mean-free paths of tens of nm. Quasi-static simulations of the time-independent Schrodinger equation suggest that a device with a size of 100 nm could operate at frequencies up to 1,000 THz.</description>

      <title>Optimal performance of a three stroke heat engine in the microscopic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the microscopic regime, we consider a stroke-based heat engine that utilizes the temperature difference between two heat baths to produce work using a working body. The working body of the engine aims to extract heat from the hot heat bath, generate work, and discharge the surplus heat into the cold heat bath through the successive execution of three strokes. We discuss the thermodynamic framework for such an engine that involves any arbitrary-dimensional working body. Next, our investigation focuses on the smallest version of this engine, which involves a two-level working body, resulting in a closed expression for optimal work production and efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of realizing such an engine within the Jaynes-Cummings model, gaining insights into optimal work production and efficiency. Finally, we scale down the engine, taking into account finite-dimensional heat baths, and obtain the expressions for optimal work and efficiency in this scenario.</description>

      <title>PristiQ: A Co-Design Framework for Preserving Data Security of Quantum Learning in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefiting from cloud computing, today's early-stage quantum computers can be remotely accessed via the cloud services, known as Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS). However, it poses a high risk of data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML). To run a QML model with QaaS, users need to locally compile their quantum circuits including the subcircuit of data encoding first and then send the compiled circuit to the QaaS provider for execution. If the QaaS provider is untrustworthy, the subcircuit to encode the raw data can be easily stolen. Therefore, we propose a co-design framework for preserving the data security of QML with the QaaS paradigm, namely PristiQ. By introducing an encryption subcircuit with extra secure qubits associated with a user-defined security key, the security of data can be greatly enhanced. And an automatic search algorithm is proposed to optimize the model to maintain its performance on the encrypted quantum data. Experimental results on simulation and the actual IBM quantum computer both prove the ability of PristiQ to provide high security for the quantum data while maintaining the model performance in QML.</description>

      <title>Interconversion between block coherence and multipartite entanglement in many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence is intrinsically related to projective measurement. When the fixed projective measurement involves higher-rank projectors, the coherence resource is referred to as block coherence, which comes from the superposition of orthogonal subspaces. Here, we establish a set of quantitative relations for the interconversion between block coherence and multipartite entanglement under the framework of the block-incoherent operations. It is found that the converted multipartite entanglement is upper bounded by the initial block coherence of single-party system. Moreover, the generated multipartite entanglement can be transferred to its subsystems and restored to block coherence of the initial single-party system by means of local block-incoherent operations and classical communication. In addition, when only the coarse-grained quantum operations are accessible for the ancillary subsystems, we further demonstrate that a lossless resource interconversion is still realizable. Our results provide a versatile approach to utilize different quantum resources in a cyclic fashion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Einstein's thought experiment that a single quantum particle diffracted after a pinhole could in principle produce an action in two or several places on a hemispherical imaging screen, here we explore theoretically the possibility to simultaneously detect the action of a single photon at two remote places. This is considered in a cascade quantum system composed of two spatially distant cavities each coupled to a qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single-photon pulse incident on the two cavities can simultaneously excite the two remote qubits and lead to two subsequent detection events even when the separation between them is comparable to the spatial length of the photon pulse. Our results not only uncover new facets of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level but also have practical applications, such as the generation of remote entanglement through a dissipative channel which is otherwise unattainable in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of mechanical quadrature-squeezed states holds significant importance in cavity optomechanics because the squeezed states have extensive applications in elucidating fundamental quantum mechanics and exploiting modern quantum technonogy. Here, we propose a reliable scheme for generating mechanical quadrature squeezing in a typical cavity optomechanical system via seeking for optimal cavity-field driving pulses using a quantum-learning-control method. We realize strong quadrature squeezing exceeded the 3 dB steady-state limit in the mechanical resonator subjected to thermal noise with one hundred thermal phonons. Furthermore, the mechanical squeezing can be ultrafastly created within one mechanical oscillation period. We also obtain the optimal pulsed drivings associated with the created mechanical squeezings and analyze the mechanism for mechanical squeezing generation. This work will motivate succeeding applications of optimal quantum control in quantum optics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Self-consistency, relativism and many-particle system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interrelation between the concepts of self-consistency, relativism and many-particle systems is considered within the framework of a unified consideration of classical and quantum physics based on the first principle of the probability conservation law. The probability conservation law underlies the Vlasov equation chain. From the first Vlasov equation, the Schr\"odinger equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the equation of motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, the Maxwell equations, the Pauli equation and the Dirac equation are constructed. The paper shows with mathematical rigor that quantum systems with a time independent function of quasi-density probability in phase space are not capable to emit electromagnetic radiation. It is shown that at the micro-level a quantum object may be considered rather as an {\guillemotleft}extended{\guillemotright} object than a point one. And the hydrodynamic description of continuum mechanics is applicable for such an object. A number of exact solutions of quantum and classical model systems is considered, demonstrating a new insight at the quantum mechanics representation.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Fokker-Planck equation via Schrodingerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a quantum simulation technique for solving the Fokker-Planck equation. Traditional semi-discretization methods often fail to preserve the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics and may even modify the Hamiltonian structure, particularly when incorporating boundary conditions. We address this challenge by employing the Schrodingerization method-it converts any linear partial and ordinary differential equation with non-Hermitian dynamics into systems of Schrodinger-type equations. We explore the application in two distinct forms of the Fokker-Planck equation. For the conservation form, we show that the semi-discretization-based Schrodingerization is preferable, especially when dealing with non-periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, we analyze the Schrodingerization approach for unstable systems that possess positive eigenvalues in the real part of the coefficient matrix or differential operator. Our analysis reveals that the direct use of Schrodingerization has the same effect as a stabilization procedure. For the heat equation form, we propose a quantum simulation procedure based on the time-splitting technique. We discuss the relationship between operator splitting in the Schrodingerization method and its application directly to the original problem, illustrating how the Schrodingerization method accurately reproduces the time-splitting solutions at each step. Furthermore, we explore finite difference discretizations of the heat equation form using shift operators. Utilizing Fourier bases, we diagonalize the shift operators, enabling efficient simulation in the frequency space. Providing additional guidance on implementing the diagonal unitary operators, we conduct a comparative analysis between diagonalizations in the Bell and the Fourier bases, and show that the former generally exhibits greater efficiency than the latter.</description>

      <title>Intuitionistic Quantum Logic Perspective: A New Approach to Natural Revision Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical belief revision framework proposed by Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson involves the revision of a theory based on eight postulates. This paper focuses on exploring the revision theory based on quantum mechanics, known as the natural revision theory. In quantum systems, there are two reasoning modes: static intuitionistic reasoning, which incorporates contextuality, and dynamic reasoning, which is achieved through projection measurement.
  We combine the advantages of the two intuitionistic quantum logics proposed by Doering and Coecke respectively. We aim to provide a truth-value assignment for intuitionistic quantum logic that not only aligns with the characteristics of quantum mechanics but also allows for truth-value reasoning. We investigate the natural revision theory based on this approach.
  We introduce two types of revision operators corresponding to the two reasoning modes in quantum systems: object-level revision and operator-level revision, and we highlight the distinctions between these two operators. Unlike classical revision, we consider the revision of consequence relations in intuitionistic quantum logic. We demonstrate that, within the framework of the natural revision theory, both types of revision operators work together on the reasoning system of consequence relations. The outcomes of revision process are influenced by the order in which the interweaved operators are applied.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and chaotic properties in Tavis-Cummings dimer: quantum and classical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two key aspects of quantum systems by using the Tavis-Cummings dimer system as a platform. The first aspect involves unraveling the relationship between the phenomenon of self-trapping (or lack thereof) and integrability (or quantum chaos). Secondly, we uncover {the possibility of} mixed behavior in this quantum system using diagnostics based on random matrix theory and make an in-depth study of classical-quantum correspondence. The setup chosen for the study is precisely suited as it (i) enables a transition from delocalized to self-trapped states and (ii) has a well-defined classical limit, thereby amenable to studies involving classical-quantum conjectures. The obtained classical model in itself has rich chaotic and ergodic properties which were probed via maximal Lyapunov exponents. Furthermore, we present aspects of chaos in the corresponding open quantum system and make connections with non-Hermitian random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Tripartite multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model: analytical solution and Wigner nonclassicalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a generic tripartite quantum system featuring a single qubit interacting concurrently with two quantized harmonic oscillators via nonlinear multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings (MPJC) interactions. Assuming the qubit is initially prepared in a superposition state and the two oscillators are in arbitrary Fock states, we analytically trace the temporal evolution of this tripartite pure initial state. We identify four broad cases, each further divided into two subcases, and derive exact analytical solutions for most cases. Notably, we obtain perfect swapping of arbitrary Fock states between the oscillators by carefully selecting system parameters. In addition, we extensively examine the manner in which the nonclassicalities of various initial oscillator Fock states, quantified by the volume of negative regions in the associated Wigner functions, evolve under the MPJC Hamiltonian, considering diverse system parameters including environmentally induced effects. Besides producing substantial enhancements in the initial value for higher photon number states, our analysis reveals that driven solely by the initial qubit energy, with both oscillators initialized in the vacuum state, the nonlinear MPJC interaction yields nontrivial Wigner negativities in the oscillators. The additional nonlinearity introduced by the multiphoton process plays a pivotal role in surpassing the initial nonclassicalities of the photon number states.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quantum One-Wayness and EFI Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical cryptography, one-way functions are widely considered to be the minimal computational assumption. However, when taking quantum information into account, the situation is more nuanced. There are currently two major candidates for the minimal assumption: the search quantum generalization of one-way functions are one-way state generators (OWSG), whereas the decisional variant are EFI pairs. A well-known open problem in quantum cryptography is to understand how these two primitives are related. A recent breakthrough result of Khurana and Tomer (STOC'24) shows that OWSGs imply EFI pairs, for the restricted case of pure states.
  In this work, we make progress towards understanding the general case. To this end, we define the notion of inefficiently-verifiable one-way state generators (IV-OWSGs), where the verification algorithm is not required to be efficient, and show that these are precisely equivalent to EFI pairs, with an exponential loss in the reduction. Significantly, this equivalence holds also for mixed states. Thus our work establishes the following relations among these fundamental primitives of quantum cryptography: (mixed) OWSGs =&gt; (mixed) IV-OWSGs $\equiv_{\rm exp}$ EFI pairs, where $\equiv_{\rm exp}$ denotes equivalence up to exponential security of the primitives.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for a bipartite pure state entanglement witness from approximate analytical diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show numerical evidence for a bipartite $d\times d$ pure state entanglement witness that is readily calculated from the wavefunction coefficients directly, without the need for the numerical computation of eigenvalues. This is accomplished by using an approximate analytic diagonalization of the bipartite state that captures dominant contributions to the negativity of the partially transposed state. We relate this entanglement witness to the Log Negativity, and show that it exactly agrees with it for the class of pure states whose quantum amplitudes form a positive Hermitian matrix. In this case, the Log Negativity is given by the negative logarithm of the purity of the amplitudes consider as a density matrix. In other cases, the witness forms a lower bound to the exact, numerically computed Log Negativity. The formula for the approximate Log Negativity achieves equality with the exact Log Negativity for the case of an arbitrary pure state of two qubits, which we show analytically. We compare these results to a witness of entanglement given by the linear entropy. Finally, we explore an attempt to extend these pure state results to mixed states. We show that the Log Negativity for this approximate formula is exact on the class of pure state decompositions for which the quantum amplitudes of each pure state form a positive Hermitian matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model embedded in a structured environment, where the atom inside an optical cavity will be affected by a hierarchical environment consisting of the cavity and its environment. We propose several effective strategies to control and suppress the decoherence effects to protect the quantum coherence of the JC atom. We study the non-perturbative control of the system dynamics by means of the leakage elimination operators. We also investigate a full quantum state reversal scheme by engineering the system and its coupling to the bath via the Petz recovery map. Our findings conclude that, with the Petz recovery map, the dynamics of the JC atom can be fully recovered regardless of Markov or non-Markovian noises. Finally, we show that our quantum control and recovery methods are effective at protecting different aspects of the system coherence.</description>

      <title>Waiting time statistics for a double quantum dot coupled with an optical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity is a prototypical example of a non-trivial open quantum system. Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that this system is a candidate for single-photon detection in the microwave domain. This motivates studies that go beyond just the average current, and also take into account the full counting statistics of photon and electron detections. With this in mind, here we provide a detailed analysis of the waiting time statistics of this system within the quantum jump unravelling, which allows us to extract analytical expressions for the success and failure probabilities, as well as for the inter detection times. Furthermore, by comparing single and multi-photon scenarios, we infer a hierarchy of occurrence probabilities for the different events, highlighting the role of photon interference events in the detection probabilities. Our results therefore provide a direct illustration of how waiting time statistics can be used to optimize a timely and relevant metrological task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the Jaynes-Cummings model, we investigate how atomic lineshapes are affected by coherently driving the atom-field interaction. We pay particular attention to the two-level atom interaction with a thermal cavity field, when both are influenced by external classical fields. Adopting a density matrix formalism, we calculate the average atomic inversion and demonstrate how the corresponding lineshapes vary as a function of the average number of thermal photons, and the atom-field classical coupling. Furthermore, we compare these results with those obtained from the standard Jaynes-Cummings model and validate our findings through numerical calculations.</description>

Abstract: Although measuring the deterministic waveform of a weak classical force is a well-studied problem, estimating a random waveform, such as the spectral density of a stochastic signal field, is much less well-understood despite it being a widespread task at the frontier of experimental physics. State-of-the-art precision sensors of random forces must account for the underlying quantum nature of the measurement, but the optimal quantum protocol for interrogating such linear sensors is not known. We derive the fundamental precision limit, the extended channel quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, and the optimal protocol that attains it. In the experimentally relevant regime where losses dominate, we prove that non-Gaussian state preparation and measurements are required for optimality. We discuss how this non-Gaussian protocol could improve searches for signatures of quantum gravity, stochastic gravitational waves, and axionic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of a charged Brownian particle in a magnetic field : an analysis of the roles of coupling via position and momentum variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of decoherence plays a key role in our understanding of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. Typically, one considers a system coupled to an external bath which forms a model for an open quantum system. While most of the studies pertain to a position coupling between the system and the environment, some involve a momentum coupling, giving rise to an anomalous diffusive model. Here we have gone beyond existing studies and analysed the quantum Langevin dynamics of a harmonically oscillating charged Brownian particle in the presence of a magnetic field and coupled to an Ohmic heat bath via both position and momentum couplings. The presence of both position and momentum couplings leads to a stronger interaction with the environment, resulting in a faster loss of coherence compared to a situation where only position coupling is present. The rate of decoherence can be tuned by controlling the relative strengths of the position and momentum coupling parameters. In addition, the magnetic field results in the slowing down of the loss of information from the system, irrespective of the nature of coupling between the system and the bath. Our results can be experimentally verified by designing a suitable ion trap setup.</description>

      <title>Bell Correlations via Constrained Colliders -- a Path from W to V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work with Ken Wharton, I have proposed that Bell correlations are a special sort of selection artefact, explained by a combination of (i) collider bias and (ii) a boundary constraint on the collider variable. This hypothesis requires no direct causal influence outside lightcones, and may hence offer a new way to reconcile Bell nonlocality and relativity. This piece outlines a new argument for the proposal. It explains how it is valid for a special class of (W-shaped) Bell experiments involving delayed-choice entanglement swapping, and argues that it can be extended to the general (V-shaped) case.</description>

      <title>Accurate Chemical Reaction Modeling on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computers Using a Noise-Resilient Wavefunction Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is of great potential for chemical system simulations. In this study, we propose an efficient protocol of quantum computer based simulation of chemical systems which enables accurate chemical reaction modeling on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this protocol, we combine an correlation energy-based active orbital selection, an effective Hamiltonian from the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) method, and a noise-resilient wavefunction ansatz. Such a combination gives a quantum resource-efficient way to accurately simulate chemical systems. The power of this protocol is demonstrated by numerical results for systems with up to tens of atoms. Modeling of a Diels-Alder (DA) reaction is also performed on a cloud-based superconducting quantum computer. These results represent an important step forward in realizing quantum utility in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Two-tone spectroscopy for the detection of two-level systems in superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-level systems (TLS) of unclear physical origin are a major contributor to decoherence in superconducting qubits. The interactions of individual TLS with a qubit can be detected via various spectroscopic methods, most of which have relied on the tunability of the qubit frequency. We propose a novel method that requires only a microwave drive and dispersive readout, and thus also works fixed-frequency qubits. The proposed two-tone spectroscopy involves a microwave pulse of varying frequency and length to excite TLSs of unknown frequencies, followed by a second pulse at the qubit frequency. TLS parameters can be estimated from the qubit population as a function of the first pulse frequency and length.</description>

      <title>Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems with a Block Encoding Quantum Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of achieving near-term quantum advantage for combinatorial optimization problems, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) are the primary methods of interest, but their practical effectiveness remains uncertain. Therefore, there is a persistent need to develop and evaluate alternative variational quantum algorithms. This study presents an investigation of the Block ENcoding Quantum Optimizer (BENQO), a hybrid quantum solver that uses block encoding to represent the cost function. BENQO is designed to be universally applicable across discrete optimization problems. Beyond Maximum Cut, we evaluate BENQO's performance in the context of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, which is of greater practical relevance. Our findings confirm that BENQO performs significantly better than QAOA and competes with VQE across a variety of performance metrics. We conclude that BENQO is a promising novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that should be further investigated and optimized to realize its full potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum master equation for many-body systems: Derivation based on the Lieb-Robinson bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) quantum master equation is a powerful tool for the study of open quantum many-body systems. However, its microscopic derivation applicable to many-body systems is available only in limited cases of weak internal couplings, and it has yet to be fully understood under what microscopic conditions the local GKSL equation is valid. We derive the local GKSL equation on the basis of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which provides an upper bound of the propagation of information in quantum many-body systems. We numerically test the validity of the derived local GKSL equation for a one-dimensional tight-binding fermion chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a time-dependent master equation for an externally driven system whose subsystems weakly interact with each other and locally connect to the thermal reservoirs. The nonadiabatic equation obtained here can be viewed as a generalization of the local master equation, which has already been extensively used in describing the dynamics of a boundary-driven system. In addition, we investigate the fundamental reason underlying the thermodynamic inconsistency generated by the local and nonadiabatic master equations. We fnd that these two equations are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics when the system is far away from the steady state, while they give rise to the contradiction at the steady state. Finally, we numerically confrm our results by considering a toy model consisting of two qubits and two local heat baths.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information reveals that orbital-wise correlation is essentially classical in Natural Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection of Quantum Chemistry and Quantum Computing has led to significant advancements in understanding the potential of using quantum devices for the efficient calculation of molecular energies. Simultaneously, this intersection is enhancing the comprehension of quantum chemical properties through the use of quantum computing and quantum information tools. This paper tackles a key question in this relationship: Is the nature of the orbital-wise electron correlations in wavefunctions of realistic prototypical cases classical or quantum?
  We delve into this inquiry with a comprehensive examination of molecular wavefunctions using Shannon and von Neumann entropies, alongside classical and quantum information theory. Our analysis reveals a notable distinction between classical and quantum mutual information in molecular systems when analyzed with Hartree-Fock canonical orbitals. However, this difference decreases dramatically, by approximately 100-fold, when Natural Orbitals are used as reference. This finding suggests that wavefunction correlations, when viewed through the appropriate orbital basis, are predominantly classical. This insight indicates that computational tasks in quantum chemistry could be significantly simplified by employing Natural Orbitals. Consequently, our study underscores the importance of using Natural Orbitals to accurately assess molecular wavefunction correlations and to avoid their overestimation. In summary, our results suggest a promising path for computational simplification in quantum chemistry, advocating for the wider adoption of Natural Orbitals and raising questions about the actual computational complexity of the multi-body problem in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Efficient molecular conformation generation with quantum-inspired algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformation generation, also known as molecular unfolding (MU), is a crucial step in structure-based drug design, remaining a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. Quantum annealing (QA) has shown great potential for solving certain combinatorial optimization problems over traditional classical methods such as simulated annealing (SA). However, a recent study showed that a 2000-qubit QA hardware was still unable to outperform SA for the MU problem. Here, we propose the use of quantum-inspired algorithm to solve the MU problem, in order to go beyond traditional SA. We introduce a highly-compact phase encoding method which can exponentially reduce the representation space, compared with the previous one-hot encoding method. For benchmarking, we tested this new approach on the public QM9 dataset generated by density functional theory (DFT). The root-mean-square deviation between the conformation determined by our approach and DFT is negligible (less than about 0.5 Angstrom), which underpins the validity of our approach. Furthermore, the median time-to-target metric can be reduced by a factor of five compared to SA. Additionally, we demonstrate a simulation experiment by MindQuantum using quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to reach optimal results. These results indicate that quantum-inspired algorithms can be applied to solve practical problems even before quantum hardware become mature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers can be used for the solution of various problems of mathematical physics. In the present paper, we consider a discretized version of the heat equation and address its solution on quantum computer using variational Anzats tree approach (ATA). We extend this method originally proposed for the system of linear equations to tackle full time dependent heat equation. The key ingredients of our method are (i) special probabilistic quantum circuit in order to add heat sources to temperature distribution, (ii) limiting auxiliary register in the preparation of quantum state, (iii) utilizing a robust cluster of repetitive nodes in the anzats tree structure. We suggest that our procedure provides an exponential speedup compared to the classical algorithms in the case of time dependent heat equation.</description>

      <title>Pricing of European Calls with the Quantum Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate valuation of financial derivatives plays a pivotal role in the finance industry. Although closed formulas for pricing are available for certain models and option types, exemplified by the European Call and Put options in the Black-Scholes Model, the use of either more complex models or more sophisticated options precludes the existence of such formulas, thereby requiring alternative approaches. The Monte Carlo simulation, an alternative approach effective in nearly all scenarios, has already been challenged by quantum computing techniques that leverage Amplitude Estimation. Despite its theoretical promise, this approach currently faces limitations due to the constraints of hardware in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.
  In this study, we introduce and analyze a quantum algorithm for pricing European call options across a broad spectrum of asset models. This method transforms a classical approach, which utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), into a quantum algorithm, leveraging the efficiency of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Furthermore, we compare this novel algorithm with existing quantum algorithms for option pricing.</description>

      <title>Noiseless linear amplification-based quantum Ziv-Zakai bound for phase estimation and its Heisenberg error limits in noisy scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the central problem about how to effectively find the available precision limit of unknown parameters. In the framework of the quantum Ziv-Zakai bound (QZZB), we employ noiseless linear amplification (NLA)techniques to an initial coherent state (CS) as the probe state, and focus on whether the phase estimation performance is improved significantly in noisy scenarios, involving the photon-loss and phase-diffusion cases. More importantly, we also obtain two kinds of Heisenberg error limits of the QZZB with the NLA-based CS in these noisy scenarios, making comparisons with both the Margolus-Levitin (ML) type bound and the Mandelstam-Tamm (MT) type bound. Our analytical results show that in cases of photon loss and phase diffusion, the phase estimation performance of the QZZB can be improved remarkably by increasing the NLA gain factor. Particularly, the improvement is more pronounced with severe photon losses. Furthermore in minimal photon losses, our Heisenberg error limit shows better compactness than the cases of the ML-type and MT-type bounds. Our findings will provide an useful guidance for accomplishing more complex quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multiparameter Metrology: The Quantum Compass Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal quantum sensing of multiple physical parameters using repeated measurements. In this scenario, the Fisher information framework sets the fundamental limits on sensing performance, yet the optimal states and corresponding measurements that attain these limits remain to be discovered. To address this, we extend the Fisher information approach with a second optimality requirement for a sensor to provide unambiguous estimation of unknown parameters. We propose a systematic method integrating Fisher information and Bayesian approaches to quantum metrology to identify the combination of input states and measurements that satisfies both optimality criteria. Specifically, we frame the optimal sensing problem as an optimization of an asymptotic Bayesian cost function that can be efficiently solved numerically and, in many cases, analytically. We refer to the resulting optimal sensor as a `quantum compass' solution, which serves as a direct multiparameter counterpart to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state-based interferometer, renowned for achieving the Heisenberg limit in single-parameter metrology. We provide exact quantum compass solutions for paradigmatic multiparameter problem of sensing two and three parameters using an SU(2) sensor. Our metrological cost function opens avenues for quantum variational techniques to design low-depth quantum circuits approaching the optimal sensing performance in the many-repetition scenario. We demonstrate this by constructing simple quantum circuits that achieve the Heisenberg limit for vector field and 3D rotations estimation using a limited set of gates available on a trapped-ion platform. Our work introduces and optimizes sensors for a practical notion of optimality, keeping in mind the ultimate goal of quantum sensors to precisely estimate unknown parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) can transmit secret keys with, in principle, information-theoretic security. However, bandwidth limitations in practical equipment threaten the security of high-speed (GHz) QKD systems. We propose and characterize a new side channel which arises when using active encoding. As an illustrative example, we focus on electro-optic phase modulation for polarization encoding at 1 GHz. We show that this side channel may reduce the maximum secure transmission distance by over 50% in a decoy state measurement-device-independent QKD protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly pure and indistinguishable photons are a prerequisite for use in quantum information processing. We introduce protocols for the distillation of indistinguishable photons that offer a significant improvement over previous work, reducing distinguishability error rates by a factor of $n$, with resource requirements scaling linearly in $n$. We present the protocols, based on the discrete Fourier transform and Hadamard (Sylvester) matrices, then give both analytical and numerical results regarding their performance. We observe that the same symmetry properties governing suppression laws are instrumental in understanding the behavior of these distillation protocols. We also prove, adapting a result from the Hadamard case, that for the $n$-photon discrete Fourier transform with $n$ a prime power, the suppression laws are exactly characterized by the well-known Zero Transmission Law based on permutation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable Quantum Position Verification secure against entangled attackers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that coherent states may offer practical advantages it was recently shown that a continuous-variable (CV) quantum position verification (QPV) protocol using coherent states could be securely implemented if and only if attackers do not pre-share any entanglement. In the discrete-variable (DV) analogue of that protocol it was shown that modifying how the classical input information is sent from the verifiers to the prover leads to a favourable scaling in the resource requirements for a quantum attack. In this work, we show that similar conclusions can be drawn for CV-QPV. By adding extra classical information of size $n$ to a CV-QPV protocol, we show that the protocol, which uses a coherent state and classical information, remains secure, even if the quantum information travels arbitrarily slow, against attackers who pre-share CV (entangled) states with a linear (in $n$) cutoff at the photon number. We show that the protocol remains secure for certain attenuation and excess noise.</description>

      <title>Photon distillation schemes with reduced resource costs based on multiphoton Fourier interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the indistinguishability of single photons is a crucial prerequisite for achieving large-scale photonic quantum computation. Photon distillation uses quantum interference to enhance the quality of single photons, sacrificing multiple photons to generate one photon with enhanced indistinguishability. By studying multiphoton interference in Fourier matrices, we find photon distillation schemes that require fewer photons to achieve the same improvement in indistinguishability, compared to the state of the art. These results may find application as a component in large-scale photonic quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A Cross-Platform Execution Engine for the Quantum Intermediate Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid languages like the Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) are essential for programming systems that mix quantum and conventional computing models, while execution of these programs is often deferred to a system-specific implementation. Here, we describe and demonstrate the QIR Execution Engine (QIR-EE) for parsing, interpreting, and executing QIR across multiple hardware platforms. QIR-EE uses LLVM to execute hybrid instructions specifying quantum programs and, by design, presents extension points that support customized runtime and hardware environments. We demonstrate an implementation that uses the XACC quantum hardware-accelerator library to dispatch prototypical quantum programs on different commercial quantum platforms and numerical simulators, and we validate execution of QIR-EE on the IonQ Harmony and Quantinuum H1-1 hardware. Our results highlight the efficiency of hybrid executable architectures for handling mixed instructions, managing mixed data, and integrating with quantum computing frameworks to realize cross-platform execution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence and Distinguishability: A Resource-Theoretic Perspective on Wave-Particle Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-particle duality, the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, illustrates essential trade-offs between two complementary aspects of quantum systems. Captured by Bohr's complementarity principle, the wave-particle duality relation indicates that perfect path discrimination in a multipath interferometer obliterates interference patterns and vice versa. In this work, from the perspective of coherence resource manipulation, we uncover a novel duality relation between quantum coherence and distinguishability in ensembles of mutually orthogonal pure states. We demonstrate the sum of `co-bits', coherence preserved after discrimination, and classical bits, distinguishability extracted through perfect discrimination is bounded. One cannot simultaneously extract all classical information and preserve coherence. Such duality relation exposes an inherent trade-off between quantum coherence and classical distinguishability resources. Our findings offer a fresh perspective and advance our understanding of the intrinsic complementary relationship between quantum and classical resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a sensitive optically-pumped magnetometer using rubidium vapor and 0.75 amg of nitrogen buffer gas in a sub-mm-width sensing channel excavated by femtosecond laser writing followed by chemical etching. The channel is buried less than 1 mm below the surface of its fused silica host material, which also includes reservoir chambers and micro-strainer connections, to preserve a clean optical environment. Using a zero-field-resonance magnetometry strategy and a sensing volume of 2.25 mm$^3$, we demonstrate a sensitivity of $\approx$ 1 $\mathrm{pT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at $10$ Hz. The device can be integrated with photonic structures and microfluidic channels with 3D versatility. Its sensitivity, bandwidth and stand-off distance will enable detection of localized fields from magnetic nanoparticles and \mul NMR samples.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Profiles in Dual-Unitary Clifford Circuits with Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study temporal entanglement in dual-unitary Clifford circuits with probabilistic measurements preserving spatial unitarity. We exactly characterize the temporal entanglement barrier in the measurement-free regime, exhibiting ballistic growth and decay and a volume-law peak. In the presence of measurements, we show that the initial ballistic growth of temporal entanglement with bath size is modified to diffusive, which can be understood through a mapping to a persistent random walk model. The peak value of the temporal entanglement barrier exhibits volume-law scaling for all measurement rates. Additionally, measurements modify the ballistic decay to the ``perfect dephaser limit" with vanishing temporal entanglement to an exponential decay, which we describe through a spatial transfer matrix method. The spatial dynamics is shown to be described by a non-Hermitian hopping model, exhibiting a PT-breaking transition at a critical measurement rate $p=1/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What time does a clock tell after quantum tunneling? Predictions and indirect measurements range from superluminal or instantaneous tunneling to finite durations, depending on the specific experiment and the precise definition of the elapsed time. Proposals and implementations utilize the atomic motion to define this delay, even though the inherent quantum nature of atoms implies a delocalization and is in sharp contrast to classical trajectories. Here, we rely on an operational approach: we prepare atoms in a coherent superposition of internal states and study the time read off via a Ramsey sequence after the tunneling process without the notion of classical trajectories or velocities. Our operational framework (a) unifies definitions of tunneling delay within one approach; (b) connects the time to a frequency standard given by a conventional atomic clock which can be boosted by differential light shifts; and (c) highlights that there exists no superluminal or instantaneous tunneling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the problem structure at multiple levels of coarseness to inform the decomposition-based hybrid quantum-classical combinatorial optimization solvers is a promising approach to scaling up variational approaches. We introduce a multilevel algorithm reinforced with the spectral graph representation learning-based accelerator to tackle large-scale graph maximum cut instances and fused with several versions of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and QAOA-inspired algorithms. The graph representation learning model utilizes the idea of QAOA variational parameters concentration and substantially improves the performance of QAOA. We demonstrate the potential of using multilevel QAOA and representation learning-based approaches on very large graphs by achieving high-quality solutions in a much faster time.\\ Reproducibility: Our source code and results are available at \url{https://github.com/bachbao/MLQAOA}</description>

      <title>Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality refers to the property that an object and its mirror image cannot overlap each other by spatial rotation and translation, and can be found in various research fields. We here propose chiral chaos and construct a chiral chaotic device via coupled whispering gallery mode resonators, where routes to chaos exhibit pronounced chirality for two opposite pumping directions. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is that time-reversal symmetry of the traveling-wave light fields is broken by the Rayleigh scatterers inserted in resonators. Combining with the Lyapunov exponents, we propose metrics to measure the symmetry and chirality between different chaotic dynamics. We find that such a chiral chaotic device can be applied to achieve sensing with high sensitivity, wide detectable range, and strong robustness to the phase and orientation randomness of weak signals. Our work presents a promising candidate for on-chip sensing and may have applications in quantum networks and chaotic communications.</description>

      <title>Gauged Gaussian PEPS -- A High Dimensional Tensor Network Formulation for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics - ranging from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter physics. In the non-perturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities with PEPS, and detail the construction of the state. The estimation of ground states is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz state. This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension with arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting new options for the simulation of non-perturbative regimes of gauge theories, including QCD.</description>

      <title>Real-space topological invariant for time-quasiperiodic Majoranas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When subjected to quasiperiodic driving protocols, superconducting systems have been found to harbor robust time-quasiperiodic Majorana modes, extending the concept beyond static and Floquet systems. However, the presence of incommensurate driving frequencies results in dense energy spectra, rendering conventional methods of defining topological invariants based on band structure inadequate. In this work, we introduce a real-space topological invariant capable of identifying time-quasiperiodic Majoranas by leveraging the system's spectral localizer, which integrates information from both Hamiltonian and position operators. Drawing insights from non-Hermitian physics, we establish criteria for constructing the localizer and elucidate the robustness of this invariant in the presence of dense spectra. Our numerical simulations, focusing on a Kitaev chain driven by two incommensurate frequencies, validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>On-board classification of underwater images using hybrid classical-quantum CNN based method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater images taken from autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV's) often suffer from low light, high turbidity, poor contrast, motion-blur and excessive light scattering and hence require image enhancement techniques for object recognition. Machine learning methods are being increasingly used for object recognition under such adverse conditions. These enhanced object recognition methods of images taken from AUV's has potential applications in underwater pipeline and optical fibre surveillance, ocean bed resource extraction, ocean floor mapping, underwater species exploration, etc. While the classical machine learning methods are very efficient in terms of accuracy, they require large datasets and high computational time for image classification. In the current work, we use quantum-classical hybrid machine learning methods for real-time under-water object recognition on-board an AUV for the first time. We use real-time motion-blurred and low-light images taken from an on-board camera of AUV built in-house and apply existing hybrid machine learning methods for object recognition. Our hybrid methods consist of quantum encoding and flattening of classical images using quantum circuits and sending them to classical neural networks for image classification. The results of hybrid methods carried out using Pennylane based quantum simulators both on GPU and using pre-trained models on an on-board NVIDIA GPU chipset are compared with results from corresponding classical machine learning methods. We observe that the hybrid quantum machine learning methods show an efficiency greater than 65\% and reduction in run-time by one-thirds and require 50\% smaller dataset sizes for training the models compared to classical machine learning methods. We hope that our work opens up further possibilities in quantum enhanced real-time computer vision in autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The momentum space Josephson effect describes the supercurrent flow between weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at two discrete momentum states. Here, we experimentally observe this exotic phenomenon using a BEC with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling, where the tunneling between two local band minima is implemented by the momentum kick of an additional optical lattice. A sudden quench of the Raman detuning induces coherent spin-momentum oscillations of the BEC, which is analogous to the a.c. Josephson effect. We observe both plasma and regular Josephson oscillations in different parameter regimes. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical model and numerical simulation, and showcase the important role of nonlinear interactions. We also show that the measurement of the Josephson plasma frequency gives the Bogoliubov zero quasimomentum gap, which determines the mass of the corresponding pseudo-Goldstone mode, a long-sought phenomenon in particle physics. The observation of momentum space Josephson physics offers an exciting platform for quantum simulation and sensing utilizing momentum states as a synthetic degree.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling $^{88}$Sr to microkelvin temperature with an integrated-photonics system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on experiments generating a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of 88-strontium ($^{88}$Sr) atoms at microkelvin temperature, using integrated-photonics devices. With metasurface optics integrated on a fused-silica substrate, we generate six-beam, circularly polarized, counter-propagating MOTs on the blue broad-line, 461 nm, and red narrow-line, 689 nm, Sr cooling transitions without bulk optics. By use of a diverging beam configuration, we create up to 10 mm diameter MOT beams at the trapping location. To frequency stabilize and linewidth narrow the cooling lasers, we use fiber-packaged, integrated nonlinear waveguides to spectrally broaden a frequency comb. The ultra-coherent supercontinuum of the waveguides covers 650 nm to 2500 nm, enabling phase locks of the cooling lasers to hertz level linewidth. Our work highlights the possibility to simplify the preparation of an ultracold 88Sr gas for an optical-lattice clock with photonic devices. By implementing a timing sequence for control of the MOT lasers and the quadrupole magnetic-field gradient, we collect atoms directly from a thermal beam into the blue MOT and continuously cool into a red MOT with dynamic detuning and intensity control. There, the red MOT temperature is as low as $2~{\mu}$K and the overall transfer efficiency up to 16%. We characterize this sequence, including an intermediate red MOT with modulated detuning. Our experiments demonstrate an integrated photonics system capable of cooling alkaline-earth gases to microkelvin temperature with sufficient transfer efficiencies for adoption in scalable optical clocks and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanical ancilla qubits generator for error correction algorithms in quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a nanoelectromechanical setup that generates properly entangled ancillary ("ancilla") qubits for error correction algorithms in quantum computing, demonstrated as an encoder for the three-qubit bit flip code. The setup is based on mesoscopic terminal utilizing the AC Josephson effect between voltage biased superconducting electrodes and mechanically vibrating mesoscopic superconducting grain in the regime of the Cooper pair box, controlled by the gate voltage. Required functionality is achieved by specifically tailored time-protocol of operating two external parameters: bias voltage and gate voltage. The superconducting grain is fixed on the free end of a cantilever, performing controlled in-plane mechanical vibrations, generating the nanomechanical coherent states organised in a pair of entangled cat-states in two perpendicular spatial directions. Cooper pair box and nanomechanical coherent states become three entangled qubits in a particular way: quantum information, initially encoded in superposition of the Cooper pair box states, is transduced into quantum superposition of two special 3-qubit entangled states, $\vert \uparrow + \, + \rangle$ and $\vert \downarrow - \, - \rangle$. It constitutes the basic input state for the three-qubit bit flip code, used in quantum computation mainly for error correction, "installed" on a single physical object in which the last two ancilla qubits are generated by the nanoelectromechanical setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the extreme near-field, when the spatial extension of the atomic wavefunction is no longer negligible compared to the atom-surface distance, the dipole approximation is no longer sufficient to describe Casimir-Polder interactions. Here we calculate the higher-order, quadrupole and octupole, contributions to Casimir-Polder energy shifts of Rydberg atoms close to a dielectric surface. We subsequently investigate the effects of these higher-order terms in thin-cell and selective reflection spectroscopy. Beyond its fundamental interest, this new regime of extremely small atom surface separations is relevant for quantum technology applications with Rydberg or surface-bound atoms interfacing with photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Wigner function of electron beams based on coherence measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a reconstruction method for the density matrix and Wigner function of electron beams through analysis of the Airy pattern intensity profile. The density matrix in a transmission electron microscope object plane was calculated using the coherence function and the electron wave amplitude and phase distributions. The Wigner function was then reconstructed using the matrix elements. Based on the Wigner function at the origin of the phase space, we derived a formula to calculate the axial brightness, and then measured the axial brightness of a Schottky field emission gun, which reflects the emitter performance more accurately and precisely than the conventional mean brightness measurements.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-loss integrated photonics enables bright, narrow-band, photon-pair sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-pair sources are critical building blocks for photonic quantum systems. Leveraging Kerr nonlinearity and cavity-enhanced spontaneous four-wave mixing, chip-scale photon-pair sources can be created using microresonators built on photonic integrated circuit. For practical applications, a high microresonator quality factor $Q$ is mandatory to magnify photon-pair sources' brightness and reduce their linewidth. The former is proportional to $Q^4$, while the latter is inversely proportional to $Q$. Here, we demonstrate an integrated, microresonator-based, narrow-band photon-pair source. The integrated microresonator, made of silicon nitride and fabricated using a standard CMOS foundry process, features ultralow loss down to $3$ dB/m and intrinsic $Q$ factor exceeding $10^7$. The photon-pair source has brightness of $1.17\times10^9$ Hz/mW$^2$/GHz and linewidth of $25.9$ MHz, both of which are record values for silicon-photonics-based quantum light source. It further enables a heralded single-photon source with heralded second-order correlation $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{h}(0)=0.0037(5)$, as well as a time-bin entanglement source with a raw visibility of $0.973(9)$. Our work evidences the global potential of ultralow-loss integrated photonics to create novel quantum light sources and circuits, catalyzing efficient, compact and robust interfaces to quantum communication and networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in high-energy $2\to 2$ scalar scattering, where the scalars are characterized by an internal flavor quantum number acting like a qubit. Working at the 1-loop order in perturbation theory, we build the final-state density matrix as a function of the scattering amplitudes connecting the initial to the outgoing state. In this construction, the unitarity of the $S$-matrix is guaranteed at the required order by the optical theorem. We consider the post-scattering entanglement between the momentum and flavor degrees of freedom of the final-state particles, as well as the entanglement of the two-qubit flavor subsystem. In each case we identify the couplings of the scalar potential that can generate, destroy, or transfer entanglement between different bipartite subspaces of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Extract Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy in a Single Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments of stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many body systems, we develop a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and corner entanglement boundaries in \textit{a single} quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different corner opening angles and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations in this field.</description>

      <title>Microscale Fiber-Integrated Vector Magnetometer with On-Tip Field Biasing using NV Ensembles in Diamond Microcystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum sensing of magnetic fields, ensembles of NV centers in diamond offer high sensitivity, high bandwidth and outstanding spatial resolution while operating in harsh environments. Moreover, the orientation of defect centers along four crystal axes forms an intrinsic coordinate system, enabling vector magnetometry within a single diamond crystal. While most vector magnetometers rely on a known bias magnetic field for full recovery of three-dimensional field information, employing external 3D Helmholtz coils or permanent magnets results in bulky, laboratory-bound setups, impeding miniaturization of the device. Here, a novel approach is presented that utilizes a fiber-integrated microscale coil at the fiber tip to generate a localized uniaxial magnetic field. The same fiber-tip coil is used in parallel for spin control by combining DC and microwave signals in a bias tee. To implement vector magnetometry using a uniaxial bias field, we preselect the orientation of the diamond crystal and then fully characterize it by rotating a static magnetic field in three planes of rotation. We demonstrate the measurement of vector magnetic fields in the full solid angle with a shot-noise limited sensitivity of $19.4\:\textrm{nT/Hz}^{1/2}$ and microscale spatial resolution while achieving a cross section of the fiber sensor head below $1\:\textrm{mm}^2.$</description>

      <title>The effect of frames on engagement with quantum technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technology is predicted to have a significant impact on society once it matures. This study (n = 637 adults representative of the Dutch population) examined the effect of different frames on engagement - specifically, information seeking, internal efficacy, general interest and perceived knowledge - with quantum technology. The different frames were: enigmatic, explaining quantum physics, benefit, risk and balanced. Results indicated that framing quantum as enigmatic does not affect engagement, while explaining quantum physics positively influences general interest. Furthermore, emphasising a benefit of quantum technology increases participants' internal efficacy, whereas highlighting both a benefit and a risk of quantum technology decreases perceived knowledge. Based on these findings, we offer practical advice for science communicators in the field and suggest further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metals containing magnetic impurities, conduction electrons screen the magnetic impurities and induce the Kondo effect, i.e., the enhancement of the electrical resistance at low temperatures. Motivated by recent advances in manipulating quantum materials by cavity confinement, we study how the ultrastrong light-matter coupling can affect the Kondo effect. We show that the ultrastrong coupling can enhance the Kondo temperature and give rise to several notable phenomena, including universal scalings of the cavity-modified Kondo effect, the photon occupation number, and the entanglement entropy between the cavity and electrons. The origin of the cavity enhancement can be understood from the mass renormalization due to the cavity-mediated nonlocal electron-electron interaction, which is akin to the polaronic mass enhancement. We combine the unitary transformations and the Gaussian variational states to analyze the quantum impurity system confined in the cavity. Our nonperturbative framework can be applied to a variety of quantum impurity problems influenced by structured quantum electromagnetic environment.</description>

Abstract: We explore superoscillations within the context of classical and quantum field theories, presenting novel solutions to Klein-Gordon's, Dirac's, Maxwell's and Einstein's equations. In particular, we illustrate a procedure of second quantization of fields and how to construct a Fock space which encompasses Superoscillating states. Furthermore, we extend the application of superoscillations to quantum tunnelings, scatterings and mixings of particles, squeezed states and potential advancements in laser interferometry, which could open new avenues for experimental tests of Quantum Gravity effects. By delving into the relationship among superoscillations and phenomena such as Hawking radiation, the Black Hole (BH) information and the Firewall paradox, we propose an alternative mechanism for information transfer across the BH event horizon.</description>

Abstract: As quantum technology is advancing, the efficient design of quantum circuits has become an important area of research. This paper provides an introduction to the MCT quantum circuit design problem for reversible Boolean functions without assuming a prior background in quantum computing. While this is a well-studied problem, optimization models that minimize the true objective have only been explored recently. This paper introduces a new optimization model and symmetry-breaking constraints that improve solving time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to earlier work when a Constraint Programming solver is used. Experiments with up to seven qubits and using up to 15 quantum gates result in several new best-known circuits for well-known benchmarks. Finally, an extensive comparison with other approaches shows that optimization models may require more time but can provide superior circuits with optimality guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>

      <title>Quantum copy-protection of compute-and-compare programs in the quantum random oracle model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.13865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Copy-protection allows a software distributor to encode a program in such a way that it can be evaluated on any input, yet it cannot be "pirated" - a notion that is impossible to achieve in a classical setting. Aaronson (CCC 2009) initiated the formal study of quantum copy-protection schemes, and speculated that quantum cryptography could offer a solution to the problem thanks to the quantum no-cloning theorem. In this work, we introduce a quantum copy-protection scheme for a large class of evasive functions known as "compute-and-compare programs" - a more expressive generalization of point functions. A compute-and-compare program $\mathsf{CC}[f,y]$ is specified by a function $f$ and a string $y$ within its range: on input $x$, $\mathsf{CC}[f,y]$ outputs $1$, if $f(x) = y$, and $0$ otherwise. We prove that our scheme achieves non-trivial security against fully malicious adversaries in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), which makes it the first copy-protection scheme to enjoy any level of provable security in a standard cryptographic model. As a complementary result, we show that the same scheme fulfils a weaker notion of software protection, called "secure software leasing", introduced very recently by Ananth and La Placa (eprint 2020), with a standard security bound in the QROM, i.e. guaranteeing negligible adversarial advantage. Finally, as a third contribution, we elucidate the relationship between unclonable encryption and copy-protection for multi-bit output point functions.</description>

      <title>Multi-party Semi-quantum Secret Sharing Protocol based on Measure-flip and Reflect Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.01380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-quantum secret sharing (SQSS) protocols serve as fundamental frameworks in quantum secure multi-party computations, offering the advantage of not requiring all users to possess intricate quantum devices. However, the current landscape of SQSS protocols predominantly caters to bipartite scenarios, rendering them inadequate for practical multi-party secret sharing requirements. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel SQSS protocol based on multi-particle GHZ states. In this protocol, the quantum user distributes predetermined secret information to multiple classical users with limited quantum capabilities, necessitating collaborative efforts among all classical users to reconstruct the correct secret information. By utilizing measure-flip and reflect operations, the transmitted multi-particle GHZ states can all contribute keys, thereby improving the utilization of transmitted particles. Security analysis shows that the protocol's resilience against prevalent external and internal threats. Additionally, employing IBM Qiskit, we conduct quantum circuit simulations to validate the protocol's accuracy and feasibility. Compared with similar studies, the proposed protocol has advantages in terms of protocol scalability, qubit efficiency, and shared message types.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by quantum network applications over classical channels, we initiate the study of $n$-party resource states from which LOCC protocols can create EPR-pairs between any $k$ disjoint pairs of parties. We give constructions of such states where $k$ is not too far from the optimal $n/2$ while the individual parties need to hold only a constant number of qubits. In the special case when each party holds only one qubit, we describe a family of $n$-qubit states with $k$ proportional to $\log n$ based on Reed-Muller codes, as well as small numerically found examples for $k=2$ and $k=3$. We also prove some lower bounds, for example showing that if $k=n/2$ then the parties must have at least $\Omega(\log\log n)$ qubits each.</description>

Abstract: The inability of Schrodinger's unitary time evolution to describe measurement of a quantum state remains a central foundational problem. It was recently suggested that the unitarity of Schrodinger dynamics can be spontaneously broken, resulting in measurement as an emergent phenomenon in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we introduce a family of models for spontaneous unitarity violation that apply to generic initial superpositions over arbitrarily many states, using either single or multiple state-independent stochastic components. Crucially, we show that Born's probability rule emerges spontaneously in all cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>

Abstract: We present the construction of standard entanglement-assisted (EA) qubit Reed-Muller (RM) codes and their tensor product variants from classical RM codes. We show that the EA RM codes obtained using the CSS construction have zero coding rate and negative catalytic rate. We further show that EA codes constructed from these same classical RM codes using the tensor product code (TPC) construction have positive coding rate and provide a subclass of EA RM TPCs that have positive catalytic rate, thus establishing the coding analog of superadditivity for this family of codes, useful towards quantum communications. We also generalize this analysis to obtain conditions for EA TPCs from classical codes to have positive catalytic rate when their corresponding EA CSS codes have zero rate.</description>

      <title>Chaos and localized phases in a two-body linear kicked rotor system</title>

Abstract: Despite the periodic kicks, a linear kicked rotor (LKR) is an integrable and exactly solvable model in which the kinetic energy term is linear in momentum. It was recently shown that spatially interacting LKRs are also integrable, and results in dynamical localization in the corresponding quantum regime. Similar localized phases exist in other non-integrable models such as the coupled relativistic kicked rotors. This work, using a two-body LKR, demonstrates two main results; firstly, it is shown that chaos can be induced in the integrable linear kicked rotor through interactions between the momenta of rotors. An analytical estimate of its Lyapunov exponent is obtained. Secondly, the quantum dynamics of this chaotic model, upon variation of kicking and interaction strengths, is shown to exhibit a variety of phases -- classically induced localization, dynamical localization, subdiffusive and diffusive phases. We point out the signatures of these phases from the perspective of entanglement production in this system. By defining an effective Hilbert space dimension, the entanglement growth rate can be understood using appropriate random matrix averages.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mechanism for reaching pseudorandom quantum states, computationally indistinguishable from Haar random, with shallow log-n depth quantum circuits, where n is the number of qudits. We argue that $\log n$ depth 2-qubit-gate-based generic random quantum circuits that are claimed to provide a lower bound on the speed of information scrambling, cannot produce computationally pseudorandom quantum states. This conclusion is connected with the presence of polynomial (in $n$) tails in the stay probability of short Pauli strings that survive evolution through such shallow circuits. We show, however, that stay-probability-tails can be eliminated and pseudorandom quantum states can be accomplished with shallow $\log n$ depth circuits built from a special universal family of `inflationary' quantum (IQ) gates. We prove that IQ-gates cannot be implemented with 2-qubit gates, but can be realized either as a subset of 2-qudit-gates in $U(d^2)$ with $d\ge 3$ and $d$ prime, or as special 3-qubit gates.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to efficiently solve a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which play a crucial role in various industries and scientific fields. However, it remains unclear which system of nonlinear ODEs, and under what assumptions, can achieve exponential speedup using a quantum computer. In this work, we introduce a class of systems of nonlinear ODEs, called quantum solvable ODEs, that can be efficiently solved on quantum computers, where the efficiency is defined as solving the system with computational complexity of $O(T {\rm log}(N) {\rm polylog}(1/\epsilon))$, where $T$ is the evolution time, $\epsilon$ is the allowed error, and $N$ is the number of variables in the system. Specifically, we employ Koopman-von Neumann linearization to map the system of nonlinear ODEs to Hamiltonian dynamics and find conditions where the norm of the mapped Hamiltonian is preserved and the Hamiltonian is sparse. This allows us to use the optimal Hamiltonian simulation technique for solving the quantum solvable ODEs with $O({\rm log}(N))$ overhead. Furthermore, we show that quantum solvable ODEs include a wide range of systems of nonlinear ODEs, such as the nonlinear harmonic oscillators and the short-range Kuramoto model. Since this is the first concrete example of solving systems of nonlinear ODEs with exponential quantum speedup, these findings contribute significantly to the application of quantum computers in solving nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>Technical Review of Four Different Quantum Systems: Comparative Analysis of Quantum Correlation, Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and Fidelity</title>

Abstract: This technical review examines the different methods and approaches have been used to create microwave modes of quantum correlation. Specifically, we consider the electro-opto-mechanical, optoelectronics, 4-coupled qubits, and InP HEMT coupled with two external oscillator methods, and evaluate their effectiveness for quantum applications. Since these systems are open quantum systems, they interact with their own environment medium and thermal bath. To ensure an accurate comparison, we analyzed all of the systems using the same criteria. Thus, at first all systems are introduced briefly, then the total Hamiltonian is theoretically derived, and finally, the system dynamics are analogously analyzed using the Lindblad master equation. We then calculate the quantum correlation between cavity modes, signal-to-noise ratio, and fidelity for each system to evaluate their performance. The results show that the strength and nature of the calculated quantities vary among the systems. An interesting result is the emergence of mixing behavior in the quantum correlation and signal-to-noise ratio for systems that use different cavities. It also identified a significant similarity between the 4-coupled qubits and InP HEMT coupled with external oscillators methods, where an avoided-level crossing occurs in the quantum correlation. Additionally, the study results reveal a high consistency between the signal-to-noise ratio and classical discord.</description>

      <title>Seeking a quantum advantage with trapped-ion quantum simulations of condensed-phase chemical dynamics</title>

Abstract: Simulating the quantum dynamics of molecules in the condensed phase represents a longstanding challenge in chemistry. Trapped-ion quantum systems may serve as a platform for the analog-quantum simulation of chemical dynamics that is beyond the reach of current classical-digital simulation. To identify a 'quantum advantage' for these simulations, performance analysis of both analog-quantum simulation on noisy hardware and classical-digital algorithms is needed. In this Review, we make a comparison between a noisy analog trapped-ion simulator and a few choice classical-digital methods on simulating the dynamics of a model molecular Hamiltonian with linear vibronic coupling. We describe several simple Hamiltonians that are commonly used to model molecular systems, which can be simulated with existing or emerging trapped-ion hardware. These Hamiltonians may serve as stepping stones toward the use of trapped-ion simulators for systems beyond the reach of classical-digital methods. Finally, we identify dynamical regimes where classical-digital simulations seem to have the weakest performance compared to analog-quantum simulations. These regimes may provide the lowest hanging fruit to exploit potential quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>Relational superposition measurements with a material quantum ruler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In physics, it is crucial to identify operational measurement procedures to give physical meaning to abstract quantities. There has been significant effort to define time operationally using quantum systems, but the same has not been achieved for space. Developing an operational procedure to obtain information about the location of a quantum system is particularly important for a theory combining general relativity and quantum theory, which cannot rest on the classical notion of spacetime. Here, we take a first step towards this goal, and introduce a model to describe an extended material quantum system working as a position measurement device. Such a "quantum ruler" is composed of $N$ harmonically interacting dipoles and serves as a (quantum) reference system for the position of another quantum system. We show that we can define a quantum measurement procedure corresponding to the "superposition of positions", and that by performing this measurement we can distinguish when the quantum system is in a coherent or incoherent superposition in the position basis. The model is fully relational, because the only meaningful variables are the relative positions between the ruler and the system, and the measurement is expressed in terms of an interaction between the measurement device and the measured system.</description>

      <title>Colored noise driven unitarity violation causing dynamical quantum state reduction</title>

Abstract: Unitarity violations were recently proposed as a cause of objective quantum state reduction. This complements proposals based on stochastic modifications of Schrodinger's equation, but also differs from them in several aspects. Here, we formalise the description of unitarity violations, and show that they generically imply models of dynamical quantum state reduction (DQSR) driven by colored noise. We present a formalism for exploring such models as well as a prescription for enforcing explicit norm-preservation, and we show that the resulting pure state dynamics is described by a modified von-Neumann Liouville equation which in a particular limit reduces to the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equations. We additionally show adherence to Born's rule emerging in the same limit from a physical constraint relating fluctuating and dissipating components of the model.</description>

Abstract: The growing demand for large-scale quantum computers is pushing research on Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC). Recent experimental efforts have demonstrated some of the building blocks for such a design. DQC systems are clusters of quantum processing units (QPUs) connected by means of quantum network infrastructures. Their extension ranges from the single box to the geographical scale. Furthermore, they can be integrated with classical High Performance Computing systems. Simulation modeling of DQC architectures provides a safe way to test and explore different what-if scenarios. Many simulation tools have been developed to support the research community in designing and evaluating quantum computer and quantum network technologies, including hardware, protocols, and applications. However, a framework for DQC simulation putting equal emphasis on computational and networking aspects has never been proposed, so far. In this paper, a design framework for DQC simulation is presented, whose core component is an Execution Manager that schedules DQC jobs for running on networked quantum computers. Two metrics are proposed for evaluating the impact of the job scheduling algorithms with respect to QPU utilization and quantum network utilization, beyond the traditional concept of makespan. The discussion is supported by a DQC job scheduling example, where two different strategies are compared in terms of the proposed metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the permutation inversion problem, the task is to find the preimage of some challenge value, given oracle access to the permutation. This is a fundamental problem in query complexity, and appears in many contexts, particularly cryptography. In this work, we examine the setting in which the oracle allows for quantum queries to both the forward and the inverse direction of the permutation -- except that the challenge value cannot be submitted to the latter. Within that setting, we consider two options for the inversion algorithm: whether it can get quantum advice about the permutation, and whether it must produce the entire preimage (search) or only the first bit (decision). We prove several theorems connecting the hardness of the resulting variations of the inversion problem, and establish a number of lower bounds. Our results indicate that, perhaps surprisingly, the inversion problem does not become significantly easier when the adversary is granted oracle access to the inverse, provided it cannot query the challenge itself.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state preparation is vital in quantum computing and information processing. The ability to accurately and reliably prepare specific quantum states is essential for various applications. One of the promising applications of quantum computers is quantum simulation. This requires preparing a quantum state representing the system we are trying to simulate. This research introduces a novel simulation algorithm, the multi-Split-Steps Quantum Walk (multi-SSQW), designed to learn and load complicated probability distributions using parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) with a variational solver on classical simulators. The multi-SSQW algorithm is a modified version of the split-steps quantum walk, enhanced to incorporate a multi-agent decision-making process, rendering it suitable for modeling financial markets. The study provides theoretical descriptions and empirical investigations of the multi-SSQW algorithm to demonstrate its promising capabilities in probability distribution simulation and financial market modeling. Harnessing the advantages of quantum computation, the multi-SSQW models complex financial distributions and scenarios with high accuracy, providing valuable insights and mechanisms for financial analysis and decision-making. The multi-SSQW's key benefits include its modeling flexibility, stable convergence, and instantaneous computation. These advantages underscore its rapid modeling and prediction potential in dynamic financial markets.</description>

Abstract: Analog quantum simulation is emerging as a powerful tool for uncovering classically unreachable physics such as many-body real-time dynamics. A complete quantification of uncertainties is necessary in order to make precise predictions using simulations on modern-day devices. Therefore, the inherent physical limitations of the device on the parameters of the simulation must be understood. This analysis examines the interplay of errors arising from simulation of approximate time evolution with those due to practical, real-world device constraints. These errors are studied in Heisenberg-type systems on analog quantum devices described by the Ising Hamiltonian. A general framework for quantifying these errors is introduced and applied to several proposed time evolution methods, including Trotter-like methods and Floquet-engineered constant-field approaches. The limitations placed on the accuracy of time evolution methods by current devices are discussed. Characterization of the scaling of coherent effects of different error sources provides a way to extend the presented Hamiltonian engineering methods to take advantage of forthcoming device capabilities.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an adiabatic state preparation protocol which implements quantum imaginary time evolution under the Hamiltonian of the system. Unlike the original quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm, adiabatic quantum imaginary time evolution does not require quantum state tomography during its runtime, and unlike standard adiabatic state preparation, the final Hamiltonian is not the system Hamiltonian. Instead, the algorithm obtains the adiabatic Hamiltonian by integrating a classical differential equation that ensures that one follows the imaginary time evolution state trajectory. We introduce some heuristics that allow this protocol to be implemented on quantum architectures with limited resources. We explore the performance of this algorithm via classical simulations in a one-dimensional spin model and highlight essential features that determine its cost, performance, and implementability for longer times, and compare to the original quantum imaginary time evolution for ground-state preparation. More generally, our algorithm expands the range of states accessible to adiabatic state preparation methods beyond those that are expressed as ground-states of simple explicit Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: The vacuum of the lattice Schwinger model is prepared on up to 100 qubits of IBM's Eagle-processor quantum computers. A new algorithm to prepare the ground state of a gapped translationally-invariant system on a quantum computer is presented, which we call Scalable Circuits ADAPT-VQE (SC-ADAPT-VQE). This algorithm uses the exponential decay of correlations between distant regions of the ground state, together with ADAPT-VQE, to construct quantum circuits for state preparation that can be scaled to arbitrarily large systems. These scalable circuits can be determined using classical computers, avoiding the challenging task of optimizing parameterized circuits on a quantum computer. SC-ADAPT-VQE is applied to the Schwinger model, and shown to be systematically improvable, with an accuracy that converges exponentially with circuit depth. Both the structure of the circuits and the deviations of prepared wavefunctions are found to become independent of the number of spatial sites, $L$. This allows for a controlled extrapolation of the circuits, determined using small or modest-sized systems, to arbitrarily large $L$. The circuits for the Schwinger model are determined on lattices up to $L=14$ (28 qubits) with the qiskit classical simulator, and subsequently scaled up to prepare the $L=50$ (100 qubits) vacuum on IBM's 127 superconducting-qubit quantum computers ibm_brisbane and ibm_cusco. After introducing an improved error-mitigation technique, which we call Operator Decoherence Renormalization, the chiral condensate and charge-charge correlators obtained from the quantum computers are found to be in good agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations.</description>

Abstract: The construction of a large-scale quantum internet requires quantum repeaters containing multiple entangled photon sources with identical wavelengths. Semiconductor quantum dots can generate entangled photon pairs deterministically with high fidelity. However, realizing wavelength-matched quantum-dot entangled photon sources faces two difficulties: the non-uniformity of emission wavelength and exciton fine-structure splitting induced fidelity reduction. Typically, these two factors are not independently tunable, making it challenging to achieve simultaneous improvement. In this work, we demonstrate wavelength-tunable entangled photon sources based on droplet-etched GaAs quantum dots through the combined use of AC and quantum-confined Stark effects. The emission wavelength can be tuned by ~1 meV while preserving an entanglement fidelity f exceeding 0.955(1) in the entire tuning range. Based on this hybrid tuning scheme, we finally demonstrate multiple wavelength-matched entangled photon sources with f&gt;0.919(3), paving a way towards robust and scalable on-demand entangled photon sources for quantum internet and integrated quantum optical circuits.</description>

      <title>A Feasibility-Preserved Quantum Approximate Solver for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an NP-optimization problem (NPO) that arises in various fields including transportation and logistics. The CVRP extends from the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), aiming to determine the most efficient plan for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers, subject to the limited carrying capacity of each vehicle. As the number of possible solutions skyrockets when the number of customers increases, finding the optimal solution remains a significant challenge. Recently, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm, has exhibited enhanced performance in certain combinatorial optimization problems compared to classical heuristics. However, its ability diminishes notably in solving constrained optimization problems including the CVRP. This limitation primarily arises from the typical approach of encoding the given problems as penalty-inclusive binary optimization problems. In this case, the QAOA faces challenges in sampling solutions satisfying all constraints. Addressing this, our work presents a new binary encoding for the CVRP, with an alternative objective function of minimizing the shortest path that bypasses the vehicle capacity constraint of the CVRP. The search space is further restricted by the constraint-preserving mixing operation. We examine and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed encoding under the framework of the variant of the QAOA, Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (AOA), through its application to several illustrative examples. Compared to the typical QAOA approach, the proposed method not only preserves the feasibility but also achieves a significant enhancement in the probability of measuring optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Let Quantum Neural Networks Choose Their Own Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03279</link>

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits as machine learning models are typically well described by their representation as a partial Fourier series of the input features, with frequencies uniquely determined by the feature map's generator Hamiltonians. Ordinarily, these data-encoding generators are chosen in advance, fixing the space of functions that can be represented. In this work we consider a generalization of quantum models to include a set of trainable parameters in the generator, leading to a trainable frequency (TF) quantum model. We numerically demonstrate how TF models can learn generators with desirable properties for solving the task at hand, including non-regularly spaced frequencies in their spectra and flexible spectral richness. Finally, we showcase the real-world effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating an improved accuracy in solving the Navier-Stokes equations using a TF model with only a single parameter added to each encoding operation. Since TF models encompass conventional fixed frequency models, they may offer a sensible default choice for variational quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Algorithm for All Quantum Wavelet Transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wavelet transforms are widely used in various fields of science and engineering as a mathematical tool with features that reveal information ignored by the Fourier transform. Unlike the Fourier transform, which is unique, a wavelet transform is specified by a sequence of numbers associated with the type of wavelet used and an order parameter specifying the length of the sequence. While the quantum Fourier transform, a quantum analog of the classical Fourier transform, has been pivotal in quantum computing, prior works on quantum wavelet transforms~(QWTs) were limited to the second and fourth order of a particular wavelet, the Daubechies wavelet. Here we develop a simple yet efficient quantum algorithm for executing any wavelet transform on a quantum computer. Our approach is to decompose the kernel matrix of a wavelet transform as a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) that are compilable by easy-to-implement modular quantum arithmetic operations and use the LCU technique to construct a probabilistic procedure to implement a QWT with a \textit{known} success probability. We then use properties of wavelets to make this approach deterministic by a few executions of the amplitude amplification strategy. We extend our approach to a multilevel wavelet transform and a generalized version, the packet wavelet transform, establishing computational complexities in terms of three parameters: the wavelet order $M$, the dimension $N$ of the transformation matrix, and the transformation level $d$. We show the cost is logarithmic in $N$, linear in $d$ and superlinear in $M$. Moreover, we show the cost is independent of $M$ for practical applications. Our proposed quantum wavelet transforms could be used in quantum computing algorithms in a similar manner to their well-established counterpart, the quantum Fourier transform.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving tridiagonal Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems and Quadratic Unconstrained Discrete Optimization (QUDO) problems with one-neighbor interactions using the quantum-inspired technology of tensor networks. Our method is based on the simulation of a quantum state to which we will apply an imaginary time evolution and perform a series of partial traces to obtain the state of maximum amplitude, since it will be the optimal state. We will also deal with the degenerate case and check the polynomial complexity of the algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a device consisting of $m$ Mach-Zehnder interferometers and realizing sorting of first $2^m$ temporal Hermite-Gauss modes of light passing though it by adjusting the accumulated temporal Gouy phase acquired by every mode. This mode-order-dependent phase shift is achieved by a fractional Fourier transform realized by a time lens in one of interferometer's arms. We consider application of such a sorter with just two interferometers to sorting the Schmidt modes of a photon pair generated in spontaneous parametric downconversion and find the theoretical lower bond on the cross-talk probability of 5.5%.</description>

      <title>Prepotential Approach: a unified approach to exactly, quasi-exactly, and rationally extended solvable quantal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a brief overview of a simple and unified way, called the prepotential approach, to treat both exact and quasi-exact solvabilities of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. It is based on the prepotential together with Bethe ansatz equations. Unlike the the supersymmetric method for the exactly-solvable systems and the Lie-algebraic approach for the quasi-exactly solvable problems, this approach does not require any knowledge of the underlying symmetry of the system. It treats both quasi-exact and exact solvabilities on the same footing. In this approach the system is completely defined by the choice of two polynomials and a set of Bethe ansatz equations. The potential, the change of variables as well as the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are determined in the same process. We illustrate the approach by several paradigmatic examples of Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real energies. Hermitian systems with complex energies, called the quasinormal modes, are also presented. Extension of the approach to the newly discovered rationally extended models is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for Dynamic Mode Decomposition Integrated with a Quantum Differential Equation Solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm that analyzes time series data simulated by a quantum differential equation solver. The proposed algorithm is a quantum version of the dynamic mode decomposition algorithm used in diverse fields such as fluid dynamics and epidemiology. Our quantum algorithm can also compute matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors by analyzing the corresponding linear dynamical system. Our algorithm handles a broad range of matrices, in particular those with complex eigenvalues. The complexity of our quantum algorithm is $O(\operatorname{poly}\log N)$ for an $N$-dimensional system. This is an exponential speedup over known classical algorithms with at least $O(N)$ complexity. Thus, our quantum algorithm is expected to enable high-dimensional dynamical systems analysis and large matrix eigenvalue decomposition, intractable for classical computers.</description>

      <title>A Simple Quantum Blockmodeling with Qubits and Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockmodeling of a given problem represented by an $N\times N$ adjacency matrix can be found by swapping rows and columns of the matrix (i.e. multiplying matrix from left and right by a permutation matrix). Although classical matrix permutations can be efficiently done by swapping pointers for the permuted rows (or columns) of the matrix, by changing row-column order, a permutation changes the location of the matrix elements, which determines the membership of a group in the matrix based blockmodeling. Therefore, a brute force initial estimation of a fitness value for a candidate solution involving counting the memberships of the elements may require going through all the sum of the rows (or the columns).
  Similarly permutations can be also implemented efficiently on quantum computers, e.g. a NOT gate on a qubit. In this paper, using permutation matrices and qubit measurements, we show how to solve blockmodeling on quantum computers. In the model, the measurement outcomes of a small group of qubits are mapped to indicate the fitness value. However, if the number of qubits in the considered group is much less than $n=log(N)$, it is possible to find or update the fitness value based on the state tomography in $O(poly(log(N)))$. Therefore, when the number of iterations is less than $log(N)$ time and the size of the considered qubit group is small, we show that it may be possible to reach the solution very efficiently.</description>

      <title>Optimal, and approximately optimal, quantum strategies for $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ and $\mathrm{FFL}$ games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze optimal, and approximately optimal, quantum strategies for a variety of non-local XOR games. Building upon previous arguments due to Ostrev in 2016, which characterized approximately optimal, and optimal, strategies that players Alice and Bob can adopt for maximizing a linear functional to win non-local games after a Referee party examines each answer to a question drawn from some probability distribution, we identify additional applications of the framework for analyzing the performance of a broader class of quantum strategies in which it is possible for Alice and Bob to realize quantum advantage if the two players adopt strategies relying upon quantum entanglement, two-dimensional resource systems, and reversible transformations. For the Fortnow-Feige-Lovasz (FFL) game, the 2016 framework is directly applicable, which consists of five steps, including: (1) constructing a suitable, nonzero, linear transformation for the intertwining operations, (2) demonstrating that the operator has unit Frobenius norm, (3) constructing error bounds, and corresponding approximate operations, for $\big( A_k \otimes \textbf{I} \big) \ket{\psi}$, and $\big( \textbf{I} \otimes \big( \frac{\pm B_{kl} + B_{lk}}{\sqrt{2}} \big) \big) \ket{\psi}$, (4) constructing additional bounds for permuting the order in which $A^{j_i}_i$ operators are applied, (5) obtaining Frobenius norm upper bounds for Alice and Bob's strategies. We draw the attention of the reader to applications of this framework in other games with less regular structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum state engineering in a five-state chainwise system by coincident pulse technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an exact analytical solution is presented for achieving coherent population transfer and creating arbitrary coherent superposition states in a five-state chainwise system by a train of coincident pulses. We show that the solution of a five-state chainwise system can be reduced to an equivalent three-state $\Lambda$-type one with the simplest resonant coupling under the assumption of adiabatic elimination (AE) together with a requirement of the relation among the four incident pulses. In this method, all of four incident pulses at each step all have the same time dependence, but with specific magnitudes. The results show that, by using a train of appropriately coincident incident pulses, this technique enables complete population transfer, as well as the creation of arbitrary desired coherent superposition between initial and final states, while the population in all intermediate states is effectively suppressed. The complete physical explanation of the underlying mechanism is presented. The results are of potential interest in applications where high-fidelity multi-state quantum control is essential, e.g., quantum information, atom optics, formation of ultracold molecules, cavity QED, nuclear coherent population transfer, light transfer in waveguide arrays, etc.</description>

      <title>A Note on Output Length of One-Way State Generators and EFIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the output length of one-way state generators (OWSGs), their weaker variants, and EFIs.
  - Standard OWSGs. Recently, Cavalar et al. (arXiv:2312.08363) give OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(\log \lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter, and conjecture that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. We prove their conjecture in a stronger manner by showing that there do not exist OWSGs with $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit outputs. This means that their construction is optimal in terms of output length.
  - Inverse-polynomial-advantage OWSGs. Let $\epsilon$-OWSGs be a parameterized variant of OWSGs where a quantum polynomial-time adversary's advantage is at most $\epsilon$. For any constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$, we construct $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with $((c+1)\log \lambda+O(1))$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $\lambda^{-c}$-OWSGs with at most $(c\log \lambda-2)$-qubit outputs.
  - Constant-advantage OWSGs. For any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct $\epsilon$-OWSGs with $O(\log \log \lambda)$-qubit outputs assuming the existence of subexponentially secure OWFs. We show that this is almost tight by proving that there do not exist $O(1)$-OWSGs with $((\log \log \lambda)/2+O(1))$-qubit outputs.
  - Weak OWSGs. We refer to $(1-1/\mathsf{poly}(\lambda))$-OWSGs as weak OWSGs. We construct weak OWSGs with $m$-qubit outputs for any $m=\omega(1)$ assuming the existence of exponentially secure OWFs with linear expansion. We show that this is tight by proving that there do not exist weak OWSGs with $O(1)$-qubit outputs.
  - EFIs. We show that there do not exist $O(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs. We show that this is tight by proving that there exist $\omega(\log \lambda)$-qubit EFIs assuming the existence of exponentially secure PRGs.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking can occur in systems periodically driven at a certain period. We predict a spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry in an atom-cavity system without external driving, in which a time scale is determined by the time of light bypass of the resonator. We demonstrate that there is a parameter range, in which a system state returns to its initial state only after two bypasses of the resonator. We believe that the predicted phenomenon opens a way to a new direction in the time crystal field.</description>

      <title>High-coherence superconducting qubits made using industry-standard, advanced semiconductor manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of superconducting qubit technology has shown great potential for the construction of practical quantum computers. As the complexity of quantum processors continues to grow, the need for stringent fabrication tolerances becomes increasingly critical. Utilizing advanced industrial fabrication processes could facilitate the necessary level of fabrication control to support the continued scaling of quantum processors. However, these industrial processes are currently not optimized to produce high coherence devices, nor are they a priori compatible with the commonly used approaches to make superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time superconducting transmon qubits manufactured in a 300 mm CMOS pilot line, using industrial fabrication methods, with resulting relaxation and coherence times already exceeding 100 microseconds. We show across-wafer, large-scale statistics studies of coherence, yield, variability, and aging that confirm the validity of our approach. The presented industry-scale fabrication process, using exclusively optical lithography and reactive ion etching, shows performance and yield similar to the conventional laboratory-style techniques utilizing metal lift-off, angled evaporation, and electron-beam writing. Moreover, it offers potential for further upscaling by including three-dimensional integration and additional process optimization using advanced metrology and judicious choice of processing parameters and splits. This result marks the advent of more reliable, large-scale, truly CMOS-compatible fabrication of superconducting quantum computing processors.</description>

      <title>Using Schroedinger cat quantum state for detection of a given phase shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that injecting a light pulse prepared in the Shroedinger cat quantum state into the dark port of a two-arm interferometer and the strong classical light into the bright one, it is possible, in principle, to detect a given phase shift unambiguously. The value of this phase shift is inversely proportional to the amplitudes of both the classical carrier and Shroedinger cat state. However, an exotic detection procedure is required for this purpose. By measuring the number of photons at the output dark port, it is possible to detect the phase shift with the vanishing "false positive" probability. The "false negative" probability in this case decreases with the increase on the amplitude of the Schroedinger cat state and, for reasonable values of this amplitude, can be made as small as about 0.1.</description>

      <title>Alternative Method for Estimating Betti Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a fast-growing field that utilizes advanced tools from topology to analyze large-scale data. A central problem in topological data analysis is estimating the so-called Betti numbers of the underlying simplicial complex. While the difficulty of this problem has been established as NP-hard, previous works have showcased appealing quantum speedup. In this article, we provide an alternative method for estimating Betti numbers and normalized Betti numbers of given simplicial complex, based on some recent advances in quantum algorithm, specifically, quantum singular value transformation. Our method can be faster than the best-known classical method for finding Betti numbers, and interestingly, it can also find the Betti numbers of the complement graph to our original one. Comparing to the best known quantum algorithm, our method generally requires lower depth circuit, in trade-off for longer running time. Regarding normalized Betti numbers, our method could match the running time of best-known quantum method in the case of dense simplices.</description>

      <title>Efficient and practical Hamiltonian simulation from time-dependent product formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose an approach for implementing time-evolution of a quantum system using product formulas. The quantum algorithms we develop have provably better scaling (in terms of gate complexity and circuit depth) than a naive application of well-known Trotter formulas, for systems where the evolution is determined by a Hamiltonian with different energy scales (i.e., one part is "large" and another part is "small"). Our algorithms generate a decomposition of the evolution operator into a product of simple unitaries that are directly implementable on a quantum computer. Although the theoretical scaling is suboptimal compared with state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., quantum signal processing), the performance of the algorithms we propose is highly competitive in practice. We illustrate this via extensive numerical simulations for several models. For instance, in the strong-field regime of the 1D transverse-field Ising model, our algorithms achieve an improvement of one order of magnitude in both the system size and evolution time that can be simulated with a fixed budget of 1000 arbitrary 2-qubit gates, compared with standard Trotter formulas.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Computing and Differential Privacy: Insights into Quantum Computing Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum computing has a strong potential in data-driven fields, the privacy issue of sensitive or valuable information involved in the quantum algorithm should be considered. Differential privacy (DP), which is a fundamental privacy tool widely used in the classical scenario, has been extended to the quantum domain, i.e. quantum differential privacy (QDP). QDP may become one of the most promising avenues towards privacy-preserving quantum computing since it is not only compatible with the classical DP mechanisms but also achieves privacy protection by exploiting unavoidable quantum noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This paper provides an overview of the various implementation approaches of QDP and their performance of privacy parameters under the DP setting. Concretely speaking, we propose a taxonomy of QDP techniques, categorized the existing literature based on whether internal or external randomization is used as a source to achieve QDP and how these approaches are applied to each phase of the quantum algorithm. We also discuss challenges and future directions for QDP. By summarizing recent advancements, we hope to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date survey for researchers venturing into this field.</description>

      <title>Optimal control in large open quantum systems: the case of transmon readout and reset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework that combines the adjoint state method together with reverse-time back-propagation to solve prohibitively large open-system quantum control problems. Our approach enables the optimization of arbitrary cost functions with fully general controls applied on large open quantum systems described by a Lindblad master equation. It is scalable, computationally efficient, and has a low memory footprint. We apply this framework to optimize two inherently dissipative operations in superconducting qubits which lag behind in terms of fidelity and duration compared to other unitary operations: the dispersive readout and all-microwave reset of a transmon qubit. Our results show that, given a fixed set of system parameters, shaping the control pulses can yield 2x improvements in the fidelity and duration for both of these operations compared to standard strategies. Our approach can readily be applied to optimize quantum controls in a vast range of applications such as reservoir engineering, autonomous quantum error correction, and leakage-reduction units.</description>

      <title>Remote Cooling of Spin-ensembles through a Spin-mechanical Hybrid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a protocol for the ground-state cooling of a tripartite hybrid quantum system, in which a macroscopic oscillator acts as a mediator between a single probe spin and a remote spin ensemble. In the presence of weak dispersive coupling between the spins and the oscillator, cooling of the oscillator and the ensemble spins can be achieved by exploiting the feedback from frequent measurements of the single probe spin. We explore the parameter regimes necessary to cool the ensemble, the oscillator, or both to their thermal ground states. This novel cooling protocol shows that, even with only weak dispersive coupling, energy transfer-like effects can be obtained by simply manipulating the probe spin. These results not only contribute to the development of a practical solution for cooling/polarizing large spin ensembles, but also provide a relatively simple means of tuning the dynamics of a hybrid system. The proposed cooling protocol thus has broader implications for advancing various quantum technology applications, such as macroscopic quantum state generation and remote sensing.</description>

Abstract: Simulation-based optimization is a widely used method to solve stochastic optimization problems. This method aims to identify an optimal solution by maximizing the expected value of the objective function. However, due to its computational complexity, the function cannot be accurately evaluated directly, hence it is estimated through simulation. Exploiting the enhanced efficiency of Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, it frequently outpaces classical simulation-based optimization, resulting in notable performance enhancements in various scenarios. In this work, we make use of a quantum-enhanced algorithm for simulation-based optimization and apply it to solve a variant of the classical Newsvendor problem which is known to be NP-hard. Such problems provide the building block for supply chain management, particularly in inventory management and procurement optimization under risks and uncertainty</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics aims at extending standard thermodynamics and non-equilibrium statistical physics to systems with sizes well below the thermodynamic limit. A rapidly evolving research field, which promises to change our understanding of the foundations of physics, while enabling the discovery of novel thermodynamic techniques and applications at the nanoscale. Thermal management has turned into a major obstacle in pushing the limits of conventional digital computers, and could likely represent a crucial issue also for quantum computers. The practical realization of quantum computers with superconducting loops requires working at cryogenic temperatures to eliminate thermal noise; ion-trap qubits need as well low temperatures to minimize collisional noise; in both cases, the sub-nanometric sizes also bring about thermal broadening of the quantum states; and even room-temperature photonic computers require cryogenic detectors. A number of thermal and thermodynamic questions therefore take center stage, such as quantum redefinitions of work and heat, thermalization and randomization of quantum states, the overlap of quantum and thermal fluctuations, and many other, even including a proper definition of temperature for the small open systems constantly out of equilibrium that are the qubits. This overview provides an introductory perspective on a selection of current trends in quantum thermodynamics and their impact on quantum computers and quantum computing, with a language accessible also to postgraduate students and researchers from different fields.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum simulation: a case study for understanding warm starts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The barren plateau phenomenon, characterized by loss gradients that vanish exponentially with system size, poses a challenge to scaling variational quantum algorithms. Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum real and imaginary time evolution we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time-step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial size time-steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Converting quantum information from stationary qubits to traveling photons enables both fast qubit initialization and efficient generation of flying qubits for redistribution of quantum information. This conversion can be performed using cavity sideband transitions. In the fluxonium, however, direct cavity sideband transitions are forbidden due to parity symmetry. Here we circumvent this parity selection rule by using a three-wave mixing element to couple the fluxonium to a resonator. We experimentally demonstrate a scheme for interfacing the fluxonium with traveling photons through microwave-induced parametric conversion. We perform fast reset on the fluxonium qubit, initializing it with &gt; 95% ground state population. We then implement controlled release and temporal shaping of a flying photon, useful for quantum state transfer and remote entanglement. The simplicity and flexibility of our demonstrated scheme enables fluxonium-based remote entanglement architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor has established itself as a general framework for the analysis and detection of equilibrium phase transitions in isolated quantum systems. We propose a novel generalization of the quantum geometric tensor, which offers a universal approach to studying phase transitions in non-Hermitian quantum systems. Our generalization is based on the concept of the generator of adiabatic transformations and can be applied to systems described by either a Liouvillian superoperator or by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We illustrate the proposed method by analyzing the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and a generic quasi-free dissipative fermionic system with a quadratic Liouvillian. Our findings reveal that this method effectively identifies phase transitions across all examined models, providing a universal tool for investigating general non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase transitions, non-Hermiticity and nonreciprocity play central roles in fundamental physics. However, the triple interplay of these three fields is of lack in the quantum domain. Here, we show nonreciprocal parity-time-symmetric phase transition in a non-Hermitian chiral quantum electrodynamical system, caused by the directional system dissipation. In remarkable contrast to previously reported nonreciprocal phase transitions, the nonreciprocal parity-time-symmetric phases appear even when the atom-resonator coupling is reciprocal. Nonreciprocal photon blockade is obtained in the nonreciprocal phase region. These results may deepen the fundamental insight of nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian quantum physics, and also open a new door for unconventional quantum manipulation.</description>

      <title>Circuit complexity and functionality: a thermodynamic perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem [1]. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (``wormhole'') connecting the two sides of an AdS ``eternal'' black hole [2]. Here we explore another link between complexity and thermodynamics for circuits of given functionality, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides a new perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits with same size and functionality that cannot be connected via local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide, a statement that implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy of computational complexity theory to its first level.</description>

      <title>Topological States Decorated by Twig Boundary in Plasma Photonic Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The twig edge states in graphene-like structures are viewed as the fourth states complementary to their zigzag, bearded, and armchair counterparts. In this work, we study a rod-in-plasma system in honeycomb lattice with twig edge truncation under external magnetic fields and lattice scaling and show that twig edge states can exist in different phases of the system, such as quantum Hall phase, quantum spin Hall phase and insulating phase. The twig edge states in the negative permittivity background exhibit robust one-way transmission property immune to backscattering and thus provide a novel avenue for solving the plasma communication blackout problem. Moreover, we demonstrate that corner and edge states can exist within the shrunken structure by modulating the on-site potential of the twig edges. Especially, helical edge states with the unique feature of pseudospin-momentum locking that could be excited by chiral sources are demonstrated at the twig edges. Our results show that the twig edges and interface engineering can bring new opportunities for more flexible manipulation of electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Effective dynamics of quantum fluctuations in field theory: with applications to cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for describing quantum fluctuations in field theory, with a focus on cosmological applications. Our method uniquely circumvents the use of operator/Hilbert-space formalism, instead relying on a systematic treatment of classical variables, quantum fluctuations, and an effective Hamiltonian. Our framework not only aligns with standard formalisms in flat and de Sitter spacetimes, which assumes no backreaction, demonstrated through the $\varphi^3$-model, but also adeptly handles time-dependent backreaction in more general cases. The uncertainty principle and spatial symmetry emerge as critical tools for selecting initial conditions and understanding effective potentials. We discover that modes inside the Hubble horizon \emph{do not} necessarily feel an initial Minkowski vacuum, as is commonly assumed. Our findings offer fresh insights into the early universe's quantum fluctuations and potential explanations to large-scale CMB anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In current studies for testing Bell inequalities at colliders, the reconstruction of spin correlations from scattering cross-sections relies on the bilinear form of the spin correlations, and not all local hidden variable models (LHVMs) have such a property. To demonstrate that a general LHVM cannot be rule out via scattering cross-section data, we propose a specific LHVM, which can exactly duplicate the same scattering cross-section for particle production and decay as the standard quantum theory, making it indistinguishable at colliders in principle. Despite of this, we find that reconstructing spin correlations through scattering cross-sections can still rule out a broad class of LHVMs, e.g., those models employing classical spin correlations as a surrogate for quantum spin correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the dissipative quantum East model via numerical tensor networks. We use matrix product states to represent evolution under quantum-jump unravellings for sizes beyond those accessible to exact diagonalisation. This allows us to demonstrate that dynamical heterogeneity accompanies slow relaxation, in analogy with what is seen in classical glassy systems. Furthermore, using variational matrix product operators we: (i) compute the spectral gap of the Lindbladian, and show that glassiness is enhanced in the presence of weak quantum fluctuations compared to the pure classical case, and (ii) obtain the dynamical large deviations by calculating the leading eigenvector of the tilted Lindbladian, and find clear evidence for a first-order active-inactive dynamical phase transition. We also show how to directly sample the rare quantum trajectories associated to the large deviations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation between two comoving Unruh-DeWitt detectors in the cosmological de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement generation or harvesting between two identical Unruh-DeWitt detectors in the cosmological de Sitter spacetime. We consider two comoving two-level detectors at a coincident spatial position. The detectors are assumed to be unentangled initially. The detectors are individually coupled to a scalar field, which eventually leads to coupling between the two detectors. We consider two kinds of scalar fields -- conformally symmetric and massless minimally coupled, for both real and complex cases. By tracing out the degrees of freedom corresponding to the scalar field, we construct the reduced density matrix for the two detectors, whose eigenvalues characterise transitions between the energy levels of the detectors. By using the existing results for the detector response functions per unit proper time for these fields, we next compute the logarithmic negativity, quantifying the degree of entanglement generated at late times between the two detectors. The similarities and differences of these results for different kind of scalar fields have been discussed.</description>
