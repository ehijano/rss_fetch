      <title>Risk Aggregation and Allocation in the Presence of Systematic Risk via Stable Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to properly manage risk, practitioners must understand the aggregate risks they are exposed to. Additionally, to properly price policies and calculate bonuses the relative riskiness of individual business units must be well understood. Certainly, Insurers and Financiers are interested in the properties of the sums of the risks they are exposed to and the dependence of risks therein. Realistic risk models however must account for a variety of phenomena: ill-defined moments, lack of elliptical dependence structures, excess kurtosis and highly heterogeneous marginals. Equally important is the concern over industry-wide systematic risks that can affect multiple business lines at once. Many techniques of varying sophistication have been developed with all or some of these problems in mind. We propose a modification to the classical individual risk model that allows us to model company-wide losses via the class of Multivariate Stable Distributions. Stable Distributions incorporate many of the unpleasant features required for a realistic risk model while maintaining tractable aggregation and dependence results. We additionally compute the Tail Conditional Expectation of aggregate risks within the model and the corresponding allocations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Loss Reserving: Dependence and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays insurers have to account for potentially complex dependence between risks. In the field of loss reserving, there are many parametric and non-parametric models attempting to capture dependence between business lines. One common approach has been to use additive background risk models (ABRMs) which provide rich and interpretable dependence structures via a common shock model. Unfortunately, ABRMs are often restrictive. Models that capture necessary features may have impractical to estimate parameters. For example models without a closed-form likelihood function for lack of a probability density function (e.g. some Tweedie, Stable Distributions, etc).
  We apply a modification of the continuous generalised method of moments (CGMM) of [Carrasco and Florens, 2000] which delivers comparable estimators to the MLE to loss reserving. We examine models such as the one proposed by [Avanzi et al., 2016] and a related but novel one derived from the stable family of distributions. Our CGMM method of estimation provides conventional non-Bayesian estimates in the case where MLEs are impractical.</description>

      <title>Extremal cases of distortion risk measures with partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the best- and worst-case of a general class of distortion risk measures when only partial information regarding the underlying distributions is available. Specifically, explicit sharp lower and upper bounds for a general class of distortion risk measures are derived based on the first two moments along with some shape information, such as symmetry/unimodality property of the underlying distributions. The proposed approach provides a unified framework for extremal problems of distortion risk measures.</description>

      <title>Robust convex risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the general properties of robust convex risk measures as they relate to worst-case values under uncertainty in random variables. We establish general concrete results regarding convex conjugates and sub-differentials. We refine results for closed forms of worst-case law-invariant convex risk measures under two specific uncertainty sets: one based on the first two moments and another on Wasserstein balls.</description>
