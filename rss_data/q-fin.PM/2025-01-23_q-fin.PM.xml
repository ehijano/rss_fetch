      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control of Iron Condor Portfolios for Profitability and Risk Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research on option strategies has primarily focused on their behavior near expiration, with limited attention to the transient value process of the portfolio. In this paper, we formulate Iron Condor portfolio optimization as a stochastic optimal control problem, examining the impact of the control process \( u(k_i, \tau) \) on the portfolio's potential profitability and risk. By assuming the underlying price process as a bounded martingale within $[K_1, K_2]$, we prove that the portfolio with a strike structure of $k_1 &lt; k_2 = K_2 &lt; S_t &lt; k_3 = K_3 &lt; k_4$ has a submartingale value process, which results in the optimal stopping time aligning with the expiration date $\tau = T$. Moreover, we construct a data generator based on the Rough Heston model to investigate general scenarios through simulation. The results show that asymmetric, left-biased Iron Condor portfolios with $\tau = T$ are optimal in SPX markets, balancing profitability and risk management. Deep out-of-the-money strategies improve profitability and success rates at the cost of introducing extreme losses, which can be alleviated by using an optimal stopping strategy. Except for the left-biased portfolios $\tau$ generally falls within the range of [50\%,75\%] of total duration. In addition, we validate these findings through case studies on the actual SPX market, covering bullish, sideways, and bearish market conditions.</description>

      <title>Improved Deep Learning Methods for Large-Scale Dynamic Portfolio Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) method that scales dynamic portfolio choice -- including consumption and multi-asset investment -- to tens of thousands of risky assets. By combining neural-network controls with Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), we avoid intractable dynamic programming (DP) grids, which traditionally cannot handle more than six assets in practice. Instead of approximating the value function (as in deep backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) methods), we track a policy-fixed adjoint process and align each gradient update with continuous-time PMP conditions. A ``one-shot'' variant deploys Pontryagin controls after a brief warm-up, often achieving 100--1,000-fold accuracy improvements over naive baselines. Crucially, on modern GPUs, 100,000 iterations typically take under an hour, while a few thousand iterations (often just 1--2 minutes) already yield near-optimal solutions for portfolios with thousands of assets. Numerical experiments confirm consistency with one-asset Merton benchmarks and tractability up to 10,000 assets, surpassing the longstanding DP-based limit of fewer than seven. This enables truly large-scale continuous-time portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Can optimal diversification beat the naive 1/N strategy in a highly correlated market? Empirical evidence from cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically examines how several alternative approaches considered affect three aspects that determine portfolio performance (the gross return, the transaction costs and the portfolio risk). We find that it is difficult to exploit the possible predictability of asset returns. However, the predictability of asset return volatility produces obvious economic value, although in a highly correlated cryptocurrencies market.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Portfolio Performance through Clustering and Sharpe Ratio-Based Optimization: A Comparative Backtesting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing portfolio performance is a fundamental challenge in financial modeling, requiring the integration of advanced clustering techniques and data-driven optimization strategies. This paper introduces a comparative backtesting approach that combines clustering-based portfolio segmentation and Sharpe ratio-based optimization to enhance investment decision-making. First, we segment a diverse set of financial assets into clusters based on their historical log-returns using K-Means clustering. This segmentation enables the grouping of assets with similar return characteristics, facilitating targeted portfolio construction. Next, for each cluster, we apply a Sharpe ratio-based optimization model to derive optimal weights that maximize risk-adjusted returns. Unlike traditional mean-variance optimization, this approach directly incorporates the trade-off between returns and volatility, resulting in a more balanced allocation of resources within each cluster. The proposed framework is evaluated through a backtesting study using historical data spanning multiple asset classes. Optimized portfolios for each cluster are constructed and their cumulative returns are compared over time against a traditional equal-weighted benchmark portfolio.</description>
