      <title>Complexity Classification Transfer for CSPs via Algebraic Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of infinite-domain constraint satisfaction problems: our basic setting is that a complexity classification for the CSPs of first-order expansions of a structure $\mathfrak A$ can be transferred to a classification of the CSPs of first-order expansions of another structure $\mathfrak B$. We exploit a product of structures (the algebraic product) that corresponds to the product of the respective polymorphism clones and present a complete complexity classification of the CSPs for first-order expansions of the $n$-fold algebraic power of $(\mathbb{Q};&lt;)$. This is proved by various algebraic and logical methods in combination with knowledge of the polymorphisms of the tractable first-order expansions of $(\mathbb{Q};&lt;)$ and explicit descriptions of the expressible relations in terms of syntactically restricted first-order formulas. By combining our classification result with general classification transfer techniques, we obtain surprisingly strong new classification results for highly relevant formalisms such as Allen's Interval Algebra, the $n$-dimensional Block Algebra, and the Cardinal Direction Calculus, even if higher-arity relations are allowed. Our results confirm the infinite-domain tractability conjecture for classes of structures that have been difficult to analyse with older methods. For the special case of structures with binary signatures, the results can be substantially strengthened and tightly connected to Ord-Horn formulas; this solves several longstanding open problems from the AI literature.</description>

      <title>Query complexity of Boolean functions on the middle slice of the cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the query complexity on slices of Boolean functions. Among other results we show that there exists a Boolean function for which we need to query all but 7 input bits to compute its value, even if we know beforehand that the number of 0's and 1's in the input are the same, i.e., when our input is from the middle slice. This answers a question of Byramji. Our proof is non-constructive, but we also propose a concrete candidate function that might have the above property. Our results are related to certain natural discrepancy type questions that, somewhat surprisingly, have not been studied before.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic and Causal Satisfiability: the Impact of Marginalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The framework of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) formalizes three types of reasoning: observational, interventional, and counterfactual, that reflect the progressive sophistication of human thought regarding causation. We investigate the computational complexity aspects of reasoning in this framework focusing mainly on satisfiability problems expressed in probabilistic and causal languages across the PCH. That is, given a system of formulas in the standard probabilistic and causal languages, does there exist a model satisfying the formulas? The resulting complexity changes depending on the level of the hierarchy as well as the operators allowed in the formulas (addition, multiplication, or marginalization). We focus on formulas involving marginalization that are widely used in probabilistic and causal inference, but whose complexity issues are still little explored. Our main contribution are the exact computational complexity results showing that linear languages (allowing addition and marginalization) yield NP^PP-, PSPACE-, and NEXP-complete satisfiability problems, depending on the level of the PCH. Moreover, we prove that the problem for the full language (allowing additionally multiplication) is complete for the class succ$\exists$R for languages on the highest, counterfactual level, which extends previous results for the lower levels of the PCH. Finally, we consider constrained models that are restricted to a given Bayesian network, a Directed Acyclic Graph structure, or a small polynomial size. The complexity of languages on the interventional level is increased to the complexity of counterfactual languages without such a constraint, that is, linear languages become NEXP-complete. On the other hand, the complexity on the counterfactual level does not change. The constraint on the size reduces the complexity of the interventional and counterfactual languages to NEXP-complete.</description>

      <title>Local vs. Global Interpretability: A Computational Complexity Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local and global interpretability of various ML models has been studied extensively in recent years. However, despite significant progress in the field, many known results remain informal or lack sufficient mathematical rigor. We propose a framework for bridging this gap, by using computational complexity theory to assess local and global perspectives of interpreting ML models. We begin by proposing proofs for two novel insights that are essential for our analysis: (1) a duality between local and global forms of explanations; and (2) the inherent uniqueness of certain global explanation forms. We then use these insights to evaluate the complexity of computing explanations, across three model types representing the extremes of the interpretability spectrum: (1) linear models; (2) decision trees; and (3) neural networks. Our findings offer insights into both the local and global interpretability of these models. For instance, under standard complexity assumptions such as P != NP, we prove that selecting global sufficient subsets in linear models is computationally harder than selecting local subsets. Interestingly, with neural networks and decision trees, the opposite is true: it is harder to carry out this task locally than globally. We believe that our findings demonstrate how examining explainability through a computational complexity lens can help us develop a more rigorous grasp of the inherent interpretability of ML models.</description>
