      <title>Three-dimensional Imaging of Pion using Lattice QCD: Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report a lattice calculation of $x$-dependent valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness with multiple values of the momentum transfer $-t$. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensemble of highly improved staggered quarks with Wilson-Clover valence fermion. The lattice spacing is 0.04 fm, and the pion valence mass is tuned to be 300 MeV. We determine the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes of the quasi-GPD matrix elements for both symmetric and asymmetric momenta transfers with similar values and show the equivalence of both frames. Then, focusing on the asymmetric frame, we utilize a hybrid scheme to renormalize the quasi-GPD matrix elements obtained from the lattice calculations. After the Fourier transforms, the quasi-GPDs are then matched to the light-cone GPDs within the framework of large momentum effective theory with improved matching, including the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections, and leading renormalon and renormalization group resummations. We also present the 3-dimensional image of the pion in impact-parameter space through the Fourier transform of the momentum transfer $-t$.</description>

      <title>Charm physics with overlap fermions on 2+1-flavor domain wall fermion configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons $D$, $D_s$, $\eta_c$ and vector mesons $D^*$, $D_s^*$, $J/\psi$ are determined from $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD at a lattice spacing $a\sim0.08$ fm. For vector mesons, the decay constants defined by tensor currents are given in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The calculation is performed on domain wall fermion configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations and the overlap fermion action is used for the valence quarks. Comparing the current results with our previous ones at a coarser lattice spacing $a\sim0.11$ fm gives us a better understanding of the discretization error. We obtain $f_{D_s^*}^T(\overline{\rm MS},\text{2 GeV})/f_{D_s^*}=0.907(20)$ with a better precision than our previous result. Combining our $f_{D_s^*}=277(11)$ MeV with the total width of $D_s^*$ determined in a recent work gives a branching fraction $4.26(52)\times10^{-5}$ for $D_s^*$ leptonic decay.</description>

      <title>Spectral densities from Euclidean lattice correlators via the Mellin transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral densities connect correlation functions computed in quantum field theory to observables measured in experiments. For strongly-interacting theories, their non-perturbative determinations from lattice simulations are therefore of primary importance. They entail the inverse Laplace transform of correlation functions calculated in Euclidean time. By making use of the Mellin transform, we derive explicit analytic formulae to define spectral densities from the time dependence of correlation functions, both in the continuum and on the lattice. The generalization to smeared spectral densities turns out to be straightforward. The formulae obtained here within the context of lattice field theory can be easily applied or extended to other areas of research.</description>

      <title>Meson Mass Sets Onset Time of Anomalous Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been established as a rigorous framework for investigating far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body criticality. Although initially thought to be trivially connected to an order parameter flipping sign, a certain kind of \textit{anomalous} DQPTs have been discovered that exhibit no direct connection to the order parameter and have been shown to arise in the presence of confinement. Here, we show in two paradigmatic models how the onset time of anomalous DQPTs is directly connected, through a power law, to the meson mass in the confined regime of a global symmetry-broken phase. This relation becomes more prominent the closer the initial parameters are to the equilibrium quantum critical point, where a relativistic quantum field theory emerges. Our findings draw a direct connection between mesons and anomalous DQPTs, highlighting the power of the latter to classify exotic far-from-equilibrium criticality.</description>

      <title>Global aspects of $3$-form gauge theory: implications for axion-Yang-Mills systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the proposition that axion-Yang-Mills systems are characterized by a $3$-form gauge theory in the deep infrared regime. This hypothesis is rigorously examined by initially developing a systematic framework for analyzing $3$-form gauge theory coupled to an axion, specifically focusing on its global properties. The theory consists of a BF term deformed by marginal and irrelevant operators and describes a network of vacua separated by domain walls converging at the junction of an axion string. It encompasses $(-1)$-, $0$-, and $3$-form spontaneously broken global symmetries. Utilizing this framework, in conjunction with effective field theory techniques and 't Hooft anomaly-matching conditions, we argue that the $3$-form gauge theory faithfully captures the infrared physics of the axion-Yang-Mills system. The ultraviolet theory is an $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory endowed with a massless Dirac fermion coupled to a complex scalar and is characterized by chiral and genuine $\mathbb{Z}_m^{(1)}$ 1-form center symmetries, with a mixed anomaly between them. It features two scales: the vev of the complex scalar, $v$, and the strong-coupling scale, $\Lambda$, with $\Lambda \ll v$. Below $v$, the fermion decouples and two symmetries emerge: $U(1)^{(2)}$ $2$-form winding and $\mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$ $1$-form center symmetries. As we flow below $\Lambda$, matching the mixed anomaly necessitates introducing a dynamical $3$-form gauge field of $U(1)^{(2)}$, which appears as the incarnation of a long-range tail of the color field. The infrared theory possesses spontaneously broken chiral, emergent $3$-form, and emergent $(-1)$-form global symmetries. It passes several checks, among which: it displays the expected restructuring in the hadronic sector upon transition between the vacua, and it is consistent under the gauging of the genuine $\mathbb Z_m^{(1)}\subset \mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Analog Quantum Simulator of a Quantum Field Theory with Fermion-Spin Systems in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating fermions coupled to spin degrees of freedom, relevant for a range of quantum field theories, represents a promising application for quantum simulators. Mapping fermions to qubits is challenging in $2+1$ and higher spacetime dimensions, and mapping bosons demands substantial quantum-computational overhead. These features complicate the realization of mixed fermion-boson quantum systems in digital quantum computers. We propose a native fermion-(large-)spin analog quantum simulator by utilizing dopant arrays in silicon. Specifically, we show how to use a dynamical lattice of coupled nuclear spins and conduction-band electrons to realize a quantum field theory: an extended Jackiw-Rebbi model involving coupled fermions and quantum rotors. We demonstrate the feasibility of observing dynamical mass generation and a confinement-deconfinement quantum phase transition in 1+1 dimensions on this platform, even in the presence of strong long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, we employ finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov simulations to investigate the dynamics of mass generation in two-dimensional square and honeycomb arrays, showing that this phenomenon can be simulated with realistic experimental parameters. Our findings reveal two distinct phases, and demonstrate robustness against the addition of Coulomb interactions. Finally, we discuss experimental signatures of the phases through transport and local charge sensing in dopant arrays. This study lays the foundation for quantum simulations of quantum field theories exhibiting fermions coupled to spin degrees of freedom using donors in silicon.</description>

      <title>The effects of SUSY on the emergent spacetime in the Lorentzian type IIB matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentzian type IIB matrix model is a promising candidate for a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. Recently we performed complex Langevin simulations by adding a Lorentz invariant mass term as an IR regulator and found a (1+1)-dimensional expanding spacetime with a Lorentzian signature emerging dynamically at late times when the fermionic contribution is omitted. Here we find that this is merely an artifact of the Lorentz boosts by showing that the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry is eliminated if one chooses a Lorentz frame appropriately. On the other hand, when we include the fermionic contribution, we find some evidence suggesting the emergence of a smooth (3+1)-dimensional expanding Lorentzian spacetime.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schwinger mechanism in QCD, and Fredholm alternatives theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of the Schwinger mechanism in QCD, which fixes uniquely the scale of the effective gluon mass and streamlines considerably the procedure of multiplicative renormalization. The key advantage of this method stems from the nonlinear nature of the dynamical equation that generates massless poles in the longitudinal sector of the three-gluon vertex. An exceptional feature of this approach is an extensive cancellation involving the components of the integral expression that determines the gluon mass; it is triggered once the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the pole-free part of the three-gluon vertex has been appropriately exploited. It turns out that this cancellation is driven by the so-called Fredholm alternatives theorem, which operates among the set of integral equations describing this system. Quite remarkably, in the linearized approximation this theorem enforces the exact masslessness of the gluon. Instead, the nonlinearity induced by the full treatment of the relevant kernel evades this theorem, allowing for the emergence of a nonvanishing mass. The numerical results obtained from the resulting equations are compatible with the lattice findings, and may be further refined through the inclusion of the remaining fundamental vertices of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a chiral effective field theory-based approach to connect $DD^*$ scattering observables at the physical and variable pion masses accessible in lattice QCD simulations. We incorporate all relevant scales associated with three-body $DD\pi$ dynamics and the left-hand cut induced by the one-pion exchange for pion masses higher than the physical one, as required by analyticity and unitarity. By adjusting the contact interactions to match experimental data at the physical pion mass and lattice finite-volume energy levels at $m_{\pi} = 280$ MeV, we predict the trajectory of the $T_{cc}$ pole as a function of the pion mass, finding it consistent with the hadronic-molecule scenario. In particular, we find that the explicit treatment of the one-pion exchange has a pronounced effect on the pole trajectory for $m_\pi \gtrsim 230$ MeV by pushing it into the complex energy plane.</description>

      <title>Steady electric currents in magnetized QCD and their use for the equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the emergence of steady electric currents in QCD as a response to a non-uniform magnetic background using lattice simulations with 2 + 1 quark flavors at the physical point, as well as leading-order chiral perturbation theory. Using these currents, we develop a novel method to determine the leading-order coefficient of the equation of state in a magnetic field expansion: the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD medium. We decompose the current expectation value into valence- and sea-quark contributions and demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the electric current is captured by the valence term alone, allowing for a comparably cheap determination of the susceptibility. Our continuum extrapolated lattice results for the equation of state confirm the findings of some of the existing studies in the literature, namely that the QCD medium behaves diamagnetically at low and paramagnetically at high temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Polarisability of Octet Baryons via Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on recent advances in lattice-QCD background-field techniques, the magnetic polarisability of octet baryons is calculated from the first principles of QCD. The results are presented in the context of new constituent quark-model calculations providing a framework for understanding the lattice results and a direct comparison with simulation results at unphysical quark masses. Using smeared quark sources, low-lying Laplacian eigenmode projection and final-state Landau mode projection, considerable attention is devoted to ensuring single-state isolation in the lattice correlation functions. We also introduce new weighting methods to reduce the sensitivity to correlation-function fits, averaging over many fits based on merit drawn from the full correlated $\chi^2$ of the fits. The techniques are implemented on the $32^3 \times 64$, 2+1-flavour dynamical-fermion lattices provided by the PACS-CS collaboration following the introduction of uniform magnetic fields quantised to the lowest nontrivial values available. After some fine tuning of the constituent quark model parameters, we find the model captures the patterns observed in the lattice QCD results very well, providing important insights into the physics underpinning the magnetic polarisabilities. Finally, comparison with the most recent results from experiment proceeds through an effective field theory formalism which incorporates estimates of finite-volume corrections and small electro-quenching corrections as the results are brought to the physical point. We find excellent agreement with experiment where available, including the proton and neutron polarisabilities.</description>

      <title>Measuring Trotter error and its application to precision-guaranteed Hamiltonian simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trotterization is the most common and convenient approximation method for Hamiltonian simulations on digital quantum computers, but estimating its error accurately is computationally difficult for large quantum systems. Here, we develop a method for measuring the Trotter error without ancillary qubits on quantum circuits by combining the $m$th- and $n$th-order ($m&lt;n$) Trotterizations rather than consulting with mathematical error bounds. Using this method, we make Trotterization precision-guaranteed, developing an algorithm named Trotter$(m,n)$, in which the Trotter error at each time step is within an error tolerance $\epsilon$ preset for our purpose. Trotter$(m,n)$ is applicable to both time- independent and dependent Hamiltonians, and it adaptively chooses almost the largest stepsize $\mathrm{d}t$, which keeps quantum circuits shallowest within the error tolerance. Benchmarking it in a quantum spin chain, we find the adaptively chosen $\mathrm{d}t$ to be about ten times larger than that inferred from known upper bounds of Trotter errors.</description>

      <title>Dilaton Forbidden Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) describes the long distance behavior of certain confining, near-conformal gauge theories that have been studied via lattice computation. Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs), emerging from the breaking of approximate, continuous, internal symmetries, are coupled to an additional scalar particle, the dilaton, arising from the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This effective theory has been employed to study possible extensions of the standard model. In this paper, we propose a complementary role for dEFT, as a description of the dark matter of the universe, with the pNGBs identified as the dark-matter particles. We show that this theory provides a natural implementation of the "forbidden" dark matter mechanism, and we identify regions of parameter space for which the thermal history of dEFT yields the measured dark matter relic density.</description>

Abstract: We determine the resummed 1-loop correction to a baryonic thermal screening mass. The calculation is carried out in the framework of a dimensionally reduced effective theory, where quarks are heavy fields due to their non-zero Matsubara frequencies. The correction due to interactions is computed at O($g^2_{ }$) in the coupling constant. In order to solve a 3-body Schr\"odinger equation, we exploit a two-dimensional generalization of the hyperspherical harmonics method. At electroweak scale temperatures, the NLO correction represents a $\sim 4.6 \%$ increase of the free-theory value $3\pi T$ of the screening mass.</description>

Abstract: The effective potential of the $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated with varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. These phenomena indicate that the applicable energy range of $O(N)$ model is more and more limited as $m_\pi$ becoming larger and temperature going higher. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>
