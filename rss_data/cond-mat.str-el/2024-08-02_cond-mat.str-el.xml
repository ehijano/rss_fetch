      <title>Numerical Study of Quantum Oscillations of the Quasiparticle Lifetime: Impurity Spectroscopy, Novel Electric Field and Strain Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum oscillation (QOs) measurements constitute one of the most powerful methods for determining the Fermi surface (FS) of metals, exploiting the famous Onsager relation between the FS area and the QO frequency. The recent observation of non-Onsager QOs with a frequency set by the difference of two FS orbits in a bulk three-dimensional metal can be understood as the QO of the quasiparticle lifetime (QPL) due to interorbital scattering [Huber, Leeb, {\it et al.}, Nature 621 (2023)]. QPL oscillations (QPLOs) generalize magneto-intersubband oscillations (MISOs) known from coupled two-dimensional metals. They may provide a novel tool for extracting otherwise hard-to-measure intra-versus interband scattering times of quasiparticles. Here, we provide a numerical lattice study of QPLOs comparing transport and thermodynamic observables. We explore the effect of different imperfections like general impurities, Hall effect-induced electric fields, various forms of strain from bending, and magnetic field inhomogeneities. We confirm the basic phenomenology of QPLOs as predicted in analytical calculations and identify additional novel, non-perturbative features. Remarkably, we find that some imperfections can stabilize, or even enhance, non-Onsager QPLOs in contrast to standard QO frequencies. We discuss various avenues for identifying QPLOs in experiments and how to use their dependence on imperfections to extract material properties.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic quantum muon effects in the kagome antiferromagnet Zn-Barlowite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon spin spectroscopy ($\mu$SR) is a powerful local probe technique e.g. used for the investigation of exotic frustrated magnetism. Ab initio simulations using Density Functional Theory with the muon treated as a point-like defect (DFT+$\mu$) are commonly employed to determine the interstitial lattice positions where the muon comes to rest after implantation. These muon stopping sites are critical for accurately interpreting $\mu$SR data. For example, for the quantum spin liquid candidate Zn-Barlowite, DFT+$\mu$ simulations identify two types of muon stopping sites: a higher-energy site where the muon is located between a fluorine and a bromine atom and three similar sites near an OH group. However, our study shows that the $\mu$SR spectra of Zn-Barlowite cannot be adequately described using muon sites determined by the conventional DFT+$\mu$ approach. Instead, accurate reproduction of the $\mu$SR data requires treating the muon as a spatially extended quantum particle with a skewed wavefunction due to the anharmonicity of the surrounding electrostatic potential. The quantum nature of the muon significantly affects its lattice position and, consequently, the observed $\mu$SR spectra. Our findings highlight the potential of $\mu$SR to study the localization of quantum particles, using the muon as the probe and particle under investigation. The light mass of the muon amplifies quantum effects, enhancing the sensitivity of our measurements and enabling a detailed comparison between experimental data and theoretical calculations. These results can be directly applied to the theoretical calculations of hydrogen localization, where quantum effects, though smaller, may still be relevant in real materials.</description>

      <title>Nonmagnetic Phase Transition in La$_3$TiSb$_5$ Observed in $^{121}$Sb Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the electrical resistivity and the $^{121}$Sb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectra of La$_3$TiSb$_5$, which is a nonmagnetic reference system for a locally noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$, in order to determine its physical properties. The resistivity exhibited a hump anomaly at 120 K, suggesting a phase transition. The NQR spectra split below 110 K, whereas the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation exhibited no anomalies. These results can be explained by the incommensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) transition. This finding suggests the importance of quasi-one-dimensional characteristics and CDW instability in these systems.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Dynamical Heterogeneity in a Supercooled Magnetic Monopole Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical heterogeneity in which transitory local fluctuations occur in the conformation and dynamics of constituent particles, is essential for evolution of supercooled liquids into the glass state. Yet its microscopic spatiotemporal phenomenology has remained unobservable in virtually all supercooled glass forming liquids. Recent theoretical advances predict that corresponding dynamical heterogeneity could also occur in supercooled magnetic monopole fluids. Motivated thus, we searched for dynamical heterogeneity when entering the supercooled monopole fluid of Dy2Ti2O7. By measuring microsecond-resolved spontaneous magnetization noise M(t,T) at temperatures between 15 mK&lt;T&lt;2500 mK we discover a sharp bifurcation in monopole noise characteristics beginning below T$\approx 1500$ mK, with the appearance of powerful monopole current bursts. This unique new form of dynamical heterogeneity first emerges upon entering the supercooled monopole fluid regime, reaches maximum intensity near T$\approx 500$ mK and then terminates along with coincident loss of ergodicity near T$\lesssim 250$ mK. Surprisingly, however, low intensity monopole noise representing activity at approximately 2% of the Dy sites persists below T$\lesssim 250$ mK, implying a population of dynamical monopoles trapped within the spin-ice ground state as T$\rightarrow 0$. This overall phenomenology significantly expands our knowledge of both supercooled monopole fluids and of the ground state of spin-ice. More generally, we demonstrate how comprehensive direct detection of the time sequence, magnitude and statistics of dynamical heterogeneity can greatly accelerate fundamental vitrification studies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Order by Disorder: A Key to Understanding the Magnetic Phases of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO), a honeycomb cobaltate, is considered a promising candidate for materials displaying the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state. This assumption is based on the distinctive characteristics of Co$^{2+}$ ions (3$d^7$) within an octahedral crystal environment, resulting in spin-orbit-coupled $J_{\rm eff}$~=~1/2 doublet states. However, recent experimental observations and theoretical analyses have raised questions regarding this hypothesis. Despite these uncertainties, reports of continuum excitations reminiscent of spinon excitations have prompted further investigations. In this study, we explore the magnetic phases of BCAO under both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields, employing dc and ac magnetic susceptibilities, capacitance, and torque magnetometry measurement. Our results affirm the existence of multiple field-induced magnetic phases, with strong anisotropy of the phase boundaries between in-plane and out-of-plane fields. To elucidate the nature of these phases, we develop a minimal anisotropic exchange model. This model, supported by combined first principles calculations and theoretical modeling, quantitatively reproduces our experimental data. In BCAO, the combination of strong bond-independent XXZ anisotropy and geometric frustration leads to significant quantum order by disorder effects that stabilize collinear phases under both zero and finite magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling at Quantum Hall Interfaces and Their Analog to Black Hole Event Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole information paradox has been hotly debated for the last few decades without a full resolution. This makes it desirable to find analogues of this paradox in simple and experimentally accessible systems, whose resolutions may shed light on this longstanding and fundamental problem. Here, we review and resolve the apparent "information paradox" in two different interfaces separating Abelian and non-Abelian quantum Hall states. In both cases, the information carried by the pseudospin degree of freedom of the Abelian anyons get scrambled when they cross the interface and enter the non-Abelian quantum Hall liquid. Nevertheless, it is found that the scrambling mechanism depends on the nature of the interface. The corresponding analogues of different concepts in black hole physics such as event horizon, black hole interior, Hawking radiation, and Page curve will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Persistent Topological Negativity in a High-Temperature Mixed-State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as it thermalizes under a strongly-symmetric quantum channel describing the Metropolis-Hastings dynamics for the $d$-dimensional classical Ising model at inverse temperature $\beta$. This channel outputs the classical Gibbs state when acting on a product state in the computational basis. When applying this channel to a GHZ state in spatial dimension $d&gt;1$, the resulting mixed state changes character at the Ising phase transition temperature from being long-range entangled to short-range-entangled as temperature increases. Nevertheless, we show that the topological entanglement negativity of a large region is insensitive to this transition and takes the same value as that of the pure GHZ state at any finite temperature $\beta&gt;0$. We establish this result by devising a local operations and classical communication (LOCC) ``decoder" that provides matching lower and upper bounds on the negativity in the thermodynamic limit which may be of independent interest. This perspective connects the negativity to an error-correction problem on the $(d-1)$-dimensional bipartitioning surface and explains the persistent negativity in certain correlated noise models found in previous studies. Numerical results confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>Energy-lowering symmetry breaking creates a flat-band insulator in paramagnetic Nb3Cl8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinary band structure calculations of quantum materials often incorrectly predicted metallic, instead of insulating electronic structure, motivating Mott-Hubbard strong electron correlation as a gapping mechanism. More recently, allowing the formation of local structural symmetry breaking motifs in otherwise ordinary band theory was shown to lower the total energy while predicting insulating gaps when they are observed. An important counter example was recently pointed out whereby the flat band formed in Nb3Cl8 by symmetry breaking is by itself partially occupied, thus failing to account for the observed insulating state. It is shown here that a generalized symmetry breaking involving the cooperative structural and magnetic effects produces in mean-field-like density functional theory an energy lowering insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Observation of current whirlpools in graphene at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-electron interactions in high-mobility conductors can give rise to transport signatures resembling those described by classical hydrodynamics. Using a nanoscale scanning magnetometer, we imaged a distinctive hydrodynamic transport pattern - stationary current vortices - in a monolayer graphene device at room temperature. By measuring devices with increasing characteristic size, we observed the disappearance of the current vortex and thus verify a prediction of the hydrodynamic model. We further observed that vortex flow is present for both hole- and electron-dominated transport regimes, while disappearing in the ambipolar regime. We attribute this effect to a reduction of the vorticity diffusion length near charge neutrality. Our work showcases the power of local imaging techniques for unveiling exotic mesoscopic transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Signature of point nodal superconductivity in the Dirac semimetal PdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Angle-Resolved Photo-emission Spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 046402 (2023)] on PdTe, a 3D-Dirac semimetal and a superconductor with the transition temperature Tc ~ 4.3 K, have revealed compelling evidence of the presence of bulk nodes in the superconducting order parameter. To investigate the validity of this proposition, here we present a detailed investigation of the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat of PdTe down to temperatures ~ 58 mK. We observed that the low temperature specific heat of PdTe with an externally applied magnetic field exhibits a power-law field dependence, a characteristic of unconventional superconductivity. Furthermore, the zero-field low-temperature electronic specific heat follows a cubic temperature dependence, which is a signature of the presence of bulk point nodes in PdTe. These intriguing observations suggest that PdTe is a rare and fascinating topological material that exhibits both Dirac semimetallic properties and superconductivity with point nodal gap symmetry.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Adiabatic Learning for Quantum-Classical Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-classical hybrid dynamics is crucial for accurately simulating complex systems where both quantum and classical behaviors need to be considered. However, coupling between classical and quantum degrees of freedom and the exponential growth of the Hilbert space present significant challenges. Current machine learning approaches for predicting such dynamics, while promising, remain unknown in their error bounds, sample complexity, and generalizability. In this work, we establish a generic theoretical framework for analyzing quantum-classical adiabatic dynamics with learning algorithms. Based on quantum information theory, we develop a provably efficient adiabatic learning (PEAL) algorithm with logarithmic system size sampling complexity and favorable time scaling properties. We benchmark PEAL on the Holstein model, and demonstrate its accuracy in predicting single-path dynamics and ensemble dynamics observables as well as transfer learning over a family of Hamiltonians. Our framework and algorithm open up new avenues for reliable and efficient learning of quantum-classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a metallic room-temperature d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, altermagnetism is a recently discovered unconventional magnetic phase characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split band structures in materials with zero net magnetization. This distinct magnetic phase not only enriches the understanding of fundamental physical concepts but also has profound impacts on condense-matter physics research and practical device applications. Spin-polarized band structures have been recently observed in semiconductors MnTe and MnTe2 with vanishing net magnetization, confirming the existence of this unconventional magnetic order. Metallic altermagnets have unique advantages for exploring novel physical phenomena related to low-energy quasiparticle excitations and for applications in spintronics as electrical conductivity in metals allows the direct manipulation of spin current through electric field. Here, through comprehensive characterization and analysis of the magnetic and electronic structures of KV2Se2O, we have unambiguously demonstrated a metallic room-temperature altermaget with d-wave spin-momentum locking. The highly anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and the spin-density-wave order emerging in the altermagnetic phase make it an extraordinary platform for designing high-performance spintronic devices and studying many-body effects coupled with the unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Singlet-Triplet Kondo Effect in Blatter Radical Molecular Junctions: Zero-bias Anomalies and Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Blatter radical has been suggested as a building block in future molecular spintronic devices due to its radical character and expected long-spin lifetime. However, whether and how the radical character manifests itself in the charge transport and magnetotransport properties seems to depend on the environment or has not yet been studied. Here, we investigate single-molecule junctions of the Blatter radical molecule in a mechanically controlled break junction device at low temperature. Differential conductance spectroscopy on individual junctions shows two types of zero-bias anomalies attributed to Kondo resonances revealing the ability to retain the open-shell nature of the radical molecule in a two-terminal device. Additionally, a high negative magnetoresistance is also observed in junctions without showing a zero-bias peak. We posit that the high negative magnetoresistance is due to the effect of a singlet-triplet Kondo effect under magnetic field originating from a double-quantum-dot system consisting of a Blatter radical molecule with a strong correlation to a second side-coupled molecule. Our findings not only provide the possibility of using the Blatter radical in a two-terminal system under cryogenic conditions but also reveal the magnetotransport properties emerging from different configurations of the molecule inside a junction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic intermetallic compound EuRhGe3 crystalizes in a non-centrosymmetric BaNiSn3-type (I4mm) structure. We studied its pressure-dependent crystal structure by using synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction at room temperature. Our results show a smooth contraction of the unit cell volume by applying pressure while preserving I4mm symmetry. No structural transition was observed up to 35 GPa. By the equation of state fitting analysis, the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative were determined to be 73 (1) GPa and 5.5 (2), respectively. Furthermore, similar to the isostructural EuCoGe3, an anisotropic compression of a and c lattice parameters was observed. Our experimental results show a good agreement with the pressure-dependent structural evolution expected from theoretical calculations below 13 GPa. Reflecting a strong deviation from integer Eu valence, the experimental volume data appear to be smaller than those of DFT calculated values at higher pressures.</description>

Abstract: The kink structure in band dispersion usually refers to a certain electron-boson interaction, which is crucial in understanding the pairing in unconventional superconductors. Here we report the evidence of the observation of a kink structure in Fe-based superconductor CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The kink shows an orbital selective and momentum dependent behavior, which is located at 15 meV below Fermi level along the Gamma-M direction at the band with dxz orbital character and vanishes when approaching the Gamma-X direction, correlated with a slight decrease of the superconducting gap. Most importantly, this kink structure disappears when the superconducting gap closes, indicating that the corresponding bosonic mode (9 meV) is closely related to superconductivity. However, the origin of this mode remains unidentified, since it cannot be related to phonons or the spin resonance mode (15 meV) observed by inelastic neutron scattering. The behavior of this mode is rather unique and challenges our present understanding of the superconducting paring mechanism of the bilayer FeAs-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Bound states in doped charge transfer insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of doping a charge transfer insulator is the most important problem in high-temperature superconductivity. In this work, we show that an in-gap bound state emerges from the localized hole of the doped charge transfer insulator. We propose an approximate ground state wavefunction based on one localized Zhang-Rice singlet and the Neel state. By calculating the excitation states with one hole added and removed from this ground state, we successfully identify the existence of bound states inside the charge transfer gap. This feature is further proved by the MPS-based Lanczos study of a system of $4\times4$ CuO$_2$ unit cells. How these bound states evolve into metallic states is further discussed. Our findings identify the key component of recent STM results on lightly doped Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ and provide a new understanding of hole-doped charge transfer insulators.</description>

      <title>Subspace-projected multireference covariant density functional theory</title>

Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear spectroscopy and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. The Bayesian analysis, which integrates the properties of nuclear matter and low-lying states, yields mean values and statistical uncertainties for the NMEs 4.33(5) for $^{136}$Xe and 5.51(14) for $^{150}$Nd. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>A topological material in the III-V family: heteroepitaxial InBi on InAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:1806.03061v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: InBi(001) is formed epitaxially on InAs(111)-A by depositing Bi on to an In-rich surface. Angle-resolved photoemission measurements reveal topological electronic surface states, close to the M bar high symmetry point. This demonstrates a heteroepitaxial system entirely in the III-V family with topological electronic properties. InBi shows coexistence of Bi and In surface terminations, in contradiction with other III-V materials. For the Bi termination, the study gives a consistent physical picture of the topological surface electronic structure of InBi(001) terminated by a Bi bilayer rather than a surface formed by splitting to a Bi monolayer termination. Theoretical calculations based on relativistic density functional theory and the one-step model of photoemission clarify the relationship between the InBi(001) surface termination and the topological surface states, supporting a predominant role of the Bi bilayer termination. Furthermore, a tight-binding model based on this Bi bilayer termination with only Bi-Bi hopping terms, and no Bi-In interaction, gives a deeper insight into the spin texture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an effective field theory of a vortex lattice in a two-dimensional neutral rotating superfluid. Utilizing particle-vortex dualities, we explore its formulation in terms of a $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to elasticity, that at low energies reduces to a compact Lifshitz theory augmented with a Berry phase term encoding the vortex dynamics in the presence of a superflow. Utilizing elasticity- and Lifshitz-gauge theory dualities, we derive dual formulations of the vortex lattice in terms of a traceless symmetric scalar-charge theory and demonstrate low-energy equivalence of our dual gauge theory to its elasticity-gauge theory dual. We further discuss a multipole symmetry of the vortex lattice and its dual gauge theory's multipole one-form symmetries. We also study its topological crystalline defects, where the multipole one-form symmetry plays a prominent role. It classifies the defects, explains their restricted mobility, and characterizes descendant vortex phases, which includes a novel vortex supersolid phase. Using the dual gauge theory, we also develop a mean-field theory for the quantum melting transition from a vortex crystal to a vortex supersolid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of dynamical screening of interactions on the transition temperatures ($T_c$) of exciton condensation in a symmetric bilayer of quadratically dispersing electrons and holes by solving the linearized Eliashberg equations for the anomalous interlayer Green's functions. We find that $T_c$ is finite for the range of density and layer separations studied, decaying exponentially with interlayer separation. $T_c$ is suppressed well below that predicted by a Hartree Fock mean field theory with unscreened Coulomb interaction, but is above the estimates from the statically screened Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using a diagrammatic framework, we show that the system is always an exciton condensate at zero temperature but $T_c$ is exponentially small for large interlayer separation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spectroscopy of semiconductor moir\'e materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use time-resolved nonlinear pump--probe measurements to reveal features of semiconductor moir\'e materials not accessible to linear spectroscopy. With an intense, red-detuned pump pulse, we generate a high density of virtual excitons or exciton--polarons in various moir\'e minibands. A broadband probe pulse in turn measures the response of all optical resonances induced by the pump-generated excitations. We generically observe a coherent blue shift originating from contact-like exciton--exciton interactions. At charge neutrality, these measurements allow us to assess the spatial overlap between different optical excitations and to observe signatures of a bound biexciton state between two different moir\'e exciton modes. In contrast to electron doped monolayers, spatially confined moir\'e attractive polarons behave as an ensemble of non-interacting two-level emitters, exhibiting an electron-density-independent ac-Stark effect. Tuning the pump laser into resonance with the attractive polaron, we demonstrate the filling of the moir\'e lattice with localized polarons and thereby realize a nonequilibrium Bose--Fermi mixture in moir\'e flat bands.</description>

Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (2d-YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the 2d-YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon et al. (arXiv:2205.04030). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper phase La4Ni3O10 has been observed with Tc of about 30 K at high pressure in recent experiment, which further expanded the family of nickelate superconductors. In this study, we explored the effects of electronic correlations in La4Ni3O10 using density function theory plus dynamical mean-field theory at ambient and high pressures. Our derived spectral functions and Fermi surface of ambient pressure phase are nicely consistent with the experimental results by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, which emphasized the importance of electronic correlations in La4Ni3O10. We also found the electronic correlations in pressured La4Ni3O10 are both orbital-dependent and layer-dependent due to the presence of Hund's rule coupling. There is a competition between the Hund's rule coupling and the crystal-field splitting, and therefore the Ni-O layers with weaker crystal-field splitting energy would have stronger electronic correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1-form symmetry, manifesting as loop-like symmetries, has gained prominence in the study of quantum phases, deepening our understanding of symmetry. However, the role of 1-form symmetries in Projected Entangled-Pair States (PEPS), two-dimensional tensor network states, remains largely underexplored. We present a novel framework for understanding 1-form symmetries within tensor networks, specifically focusing on the derivation of algebraic relations for symmetry matrices on the PEPS virtual legs. Our results reveal that 1-form symmetries impose stringent constraints on tensor network representations, leading to distinct anomalous braiding phases carried by symmetry matrices. We demonstrate how these symmetries influence the ground state and tangent space in PEPS, providing new insights into their physical implications for enhancing ground state optimization efficiency and characterizing the 1-form symmetry structure in excited states.</description>

Abstract: We address the experimentally relevant situation, where a non-equilibrium state is created at the edge of a quantum Hall system by injecting charge current into a chiral edge state with the help of a quantum point contact, quantum dots, or mesoscopic Ohmic contact. We show that the commonly accepted picture of the full equilibration of a non-equilibrium state at finite distances longer than a characteristic length scale contradicts to the charge conservation requirement. We use a phenomenological transmission line model to account for the local equilibration process and the charge and energy conserving dynamics of the collective mode. By solving this model in the limit of long distances $L$ from the injection point, we demonstrate that the correction of the electron distribution function to its eventual equilibrium form scales down slowly as $1/\sqrt{L}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon previous $2D$ studies, this research focuses on describing $3D$ tensor renormalisation group (RG) flows for lattice spin systems, such as the Ising model. We present a novel RG map, which operates on tensors with infinite-dimensional legs and does not involve truncations, in contrast to numerical tensor RG maps. To construct this map, we developed new techniques for analysing tensor networks. Our analysis shows that the constructed RG map contracts the region around the tensor $A_*$, corresponding to the high-temperature phase of the $3D$ Ising model. This leads to the iterated RG map convergence in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to $A_*$ when initialised in the vicinity of $A_*$. This work provides the first steps towards the rigorous understanding of tensor RG maps in $3D$.</description>

Abstract: We carry out a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic structure of the ambient-pressure bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing the hybrid exchange-correlation functional, we show that the exchange-correlation pushes the antibonding $d_{z^2}$ bands below the Fermi level to be fully occupied. The calculated Fermi surfaces and the correlation normalized band structure match well with the experimental findings at ambient pressure. Moreover, the electronic susceptibility calculated for this new band structure features nesting-induced peaks near the wave vector $Q=(\pi/2, \pi/2)$, suggesting a possible density wave instability in agreement with recent experiments. Through a mean field study and DFT+U calculation, we confirm the spin-charge intertwined double stripe order is the magnetic ground state. Our results provide a faithful description for the low-pressure La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Minority magnons and mode branching in monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the presence of minority magnons in monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ using first principles calculations. Minority magnons constitute a new type of collective magnetic excitation which increase the magnetic moment -- contrary to ordinary (majority) magnons which lower it -- giving rise to spin-raising poles in the dynamic susceptibility $\chi^{-+}(\omega)$. The presence of such quasi-particles is made possible by the nontrivial ferromagnetic band structure of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. We calculate the susceptibility using time-dependent density functional theory and perform a detailed mode analysis, which allows us to identify and investigate individual magnon modes as well as the Stoner excitations that constitute the many-body spectrum. The analysis reveals a plethora of both majority and minority excitations, which in addition to the main magnon branches include both satellite, valley and spin-inversion magnons thanks to the electron itinerancy of the system. Crucially, the analysis allows us to separate peaks of a coherent collective nature from those of mixed magnon/Stoner nature. To this end, we predict that the lowest energy minority magnon mode of monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ indeed constitutes a coherent collective quasi-particle at long wavelengths and introduce a simplistic gaussian model for the observed minority magnon enhancement. The underlying physics is in no way restricted to Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, and minority magnons are thus expected to be observable in other complex ferromagnetic materials as well.</description>

Abstract: We adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a systematic approach for analyzing strongly correlated systems by adapting the conventional quantum cluster method to a quantum circuit model. We have developed a more concise formula for calculating the cluster's Green's function, requiring only real-number computations on the quantum circuit instead of complex ones. This approach is inherently more suited to quantum circuits, which primarily yield statistical probabilities. As an illustrative example, we explored the Hubbard model on a 2D lattice. The ground state is determined utilizing Xiaohong, a superconducting quantum processor equipped with 66 qubits, supplied by QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. Subsequently, we employed the circuit model to compute the real-time retarded Green's function for the cluster, which is then used to determine the lattice Green's function. We conducted an examination of the band structure in the insulator phase of the lattice system. This preliminary investigation lays the groundwork for exploring a wealth of innovative physics within the field of condensed matter physics.</description>
