      <title>Cosmological Constraints on 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity and Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy: Implications for Black Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct imaging of black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables precision tests of gravity in the strong-field regime. We investigate the cosmological evolution and optical appearance of black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy (KHDE). Utilizing Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) datasets, we constrain model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. Results indicate that the late-time universe statistically favors a phantom-like equation of state ($c \approx 0.704$). Regarding the EGB coupling $\alpha$, although data favor a positive value, the parameter space permits negative values down to a theoretical stability cut-off at $\alpha \approx -0.03$. While the best-fit suggests deviation, results remain consistent with General Relativity ($\alpha=0$) within the $2\sigma$ confidence level. Based on these constraints, we model the secular mass accretion history (treating accretion efficiency as a phenomenological constant) and compute the shadow radius evolution. We find that in a realistic dispersive plasma environment, refractive effects significantly mask intrinsic gravitational and dark energy signatures, causing global shadow shrinkage. Nevertheless, a characteristic systematic intrinsic deviation of $\sim 1\%$--$1.5\%$ (under a conservative accretion scenario) persists at redshifts $z \lesssim 1.5$ relative to standard $\Lambda$CDM predictions. These findings suggest that despite environmental dominance, precise statistical analyses of shadow populations could disentangle these subtle dynamic dark energy signals from the standard cosmological paradigm.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic galaxy alignments in CAMELS simulations and the significant impact of baryon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detection of the intrinsic galaxy alignments in the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the alignment amplitude depends significantly on cosmological and supernova feedback parameters - specifically $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, $A_{\text{SN1}}$, $A_{\text{SN2}}$- while no dependence on AGN feedback is observed (due to the limited simulation volume $(25\,h^{-1}\,\text{Mpc})^3$). The dependence on $\sigma_8$ vanishes when projected correlation functions $w_{m+}$ are normalized by matter density correlations $w_{mm}$, consistent with predictions from linear alignment models. We find alignment amplitudes in quiescent galaxies to exceed those in star-forming galaxies by an order of magnitude. Moreover, examining orientation-only correlation functions from ellipticity-normalized galaxies $\tilde w_{m+}$, we confirm that alignment signals retain sensitivity to supernova feedback across full, star forming, quiescent, and ellipticity-normalized samples. Finally, we find evidence that supernova feedback impacts alignment signals differently in star-forming versus quiescent populations, suggesting that distinct alignment mechanisms operate across galaxy types. Our results offer key insights for understanding galaxy formation and alignment models for future weak gravitational lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Modeling Galaxy Formation in Cosmological Simulations with CRK-HACC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-consistently modeling baryonic effects in survey-scale cosmological simulations has become increasingly important as the diversity, precision, and statistical reach of modern observations continue to improve. The advent of exascale computing now enables a new generation of simulations that couple these physical processes across full-sky volumes with excellent statistical sampling of large-scale structure tracers such as galaxies, groups, and clusters. To support these efforts, we extend the CRK-HACC framework, a GPU-accelerated cosmological hydrodynamics code, with a suite of astrophysical subgrid models that simulate radiative cooling, star formation, stellar evolution, and AGN feedback within a numerically robust formulation optimized for scalability on modern exascale architectures. The models were selected and calibrated to reproduce observed galaxy stellar mass functions over the redshift range $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$ and cluster populations probed by cosmological surveys, capturing the large-scale baryonic evolution relevant for multi-wavelength, cross-correlated analyses. We describe the implementation and calibration of these models and demonstrate their consistency with observed galaxy population statistics and modern hydrodynamic simulations, establishing the baseline for exascale efforts that extend this framework to survey-scale volumes.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: $B$-mode delensing with DR6 data and external tracers of large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale $B$-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a prime target for current and future experiments in search of primordial gravitational waves (PGW). With increasingly sensitive instruments being deployed, secondary $B$-modes induced by the weak gravitational lensing of CMB photons are becoming an important limitation and need to be removed, a process known as delensing. In this work, we combine internally reconstructed CMB lensing maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 with galaxy samples from unWISE and a map of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations from Planck to produce a well-correlated tracer of the CMB lensing field. Our co-added tracer, shown to be 55-85% correlated with the true lensing convergence at multipoles $L \leq 2000$, is then convolved with ACT DR6 $E$-mode polarization to yield a template of the lensing $B$-modes. We assess its performance on a wide range of scales by using it to delens ACT DR6 and Planck $B$-modes over 23% of the sky, removing around 39% of the lensing power at $100\leq l \leq 1500$ and 47% at $30 \leq l \leq 300$, respectively. Our template achieves the highest delensing efficiency to date and will be useful for the analysis of early polarization maps from the Simons Observatory (SO). We finally outline prospects for further improvements by including additional large-scale structure tracers from upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Numerical implementation of flat FLRW models of cosmic expansion with Planck 2018 cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit numerical implementation of the Friedmann equations to model the expansion of the Universe in spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies. Using cosmological parameters from the Planck 2018 results for the concordance LCDM model, we compute the evolution of the scale factor a(t) by integrating the Friedmann acceleration equation together with the continuity equation for a perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state p = w*rho. The model includes radiation, non-relativistic matter, and a dark-energy component with constant equation-of-state parameter w. An explicit Euler scheme implemented in Python is used to evolve a(t) into the past and the future, allowing exploration of the qualitative behavior of the expansion for different values of w, including the LCDM case (w = -1), phantom energy (w &lt; -1), and values associated with domain walls and cosmic strings. The simulations qualitatively reproduce the standard radiation-, matter-, and dark-energy-dominated expansion regimes. The code is simple and modular, and is intended as a computational and pedagogical tool for undergraduate and graduate cosmology courses.</description>

      <title>Deep insights into Abell 2163: unveiling the treasure trove of ICM plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonthermal emission observed in galaxy clusters provides a direct probe into the plasma physics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) under extreme conditions. We report the first detailed analysis of the giant radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2163, using upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and Very Large Array (VLA) observations. Combining radio data (300-1400 MHz) with archival X-ray data offers a unique opportunity to study the complex ICM physics of the cluster. The sensitive uGMRT observations map the halo emission for the first time out to an extent of ~3.3 Mpc, up to $r_{500}$, and also effectively recover other diffuse sources. The radio surface brightness profile is well fitted with an exponential function up to r$_{500}$, with an evolution of e-folding radius over frequencies (larger at low frequencies). The spatially resolved spectral index map reveals fluctuations and outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. Radio and X-ray surface brightness are well correlated, with a correlation slope of $\sim$0.70 for the halo, and $\sim$0.40 for the ridge. The correlation slope varies from cluster centre to outskirts, suggesting the magnetic field and thermal gas density scaling relation (B $\propto n_{e}^{0.5}$) should be reassessed, provided that the re-acceleration efficiency is constant. We propose that diffuse lobes at the periphery could serve as a reservoir for seed electrons, behind the radio halo emission, with an estimated acceleration efficiency reaching $\sim$0.1% in the external regions. Additionally, a major E-W merger is suggested, leading to turbulence in the ICM and generating the halo.</description>

      <title>Probing CMB Polarization Gaussianity with the Statistics of Unpolarized Points: Non-Gaussianity of Planck Data and Prospects for Future B-Mode Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Gaussianity test of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization by analyzing the statistics of unpolarized points in the sky, classified into three distinct types: saddles, comets, and beaks. This classification of singular points where both Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ vanish stems from the fact that linear polarization is described by a second-rank tensor. By varying the number of spherical harmonics included in the polarization maps, one can probe the statistics of these singularities across a range of angular scales. Applying this method to Planck data we find clear evidence of non-Gaussianity in both $E$ and $B$ modes of polarization. This approach may be especially useful for processing data from current and future experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO). In particular, it can help to assess the Gaussianity of a potentially detected B mode signal, thereby determining whether it arises from primordial tensor perturbations -- as predicted by inflation -- or from alternative sources such as polarized foregrounds (e.g., thermal dust), E-to-B mode leakage, systematics, photon noise or gravitational lensing. We have made publicly available software that finds
  unpolarized points of all three types on any polarization map in
  Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelation (HEALPix) format with full or incomplete sky coverage
  to enable testing of the observed signal for Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Primordial Non-Gaussianity from UNIONS Lyman-Break Galaxies and Planck CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs), characterized by $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, provide a powerful window into the physics of inflation. Cross-correlating high-redshift tracer samples with the CMB lensing potential offers a particularly robust probe of PNGs, mitigating imaging systematics that typically affect large-scale measurements from tracer auto-spectra. In this context, UNIONS enables the selection of $u$-dropout high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs). We perform a MCMC-based forecast to estimate the uncertainties on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and on a galaxy bias parameter, which captures our uncertainty in the tracer bias. From the angular cross-power spectrum between LBGs and Planck CMB lensing, we forecast $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=34$ for an idealized photometric sample of $r&lt;24.3$ LBGs selected with a Random Forest classification algorithm from UNIONS-like $ugriz$ imaging, with a resulting surface density of $1,100$ deg$^{-2}$. This precision can be improved to $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=20$ after spectroscopic follow-up with DESI, during its next phase starting in 2029, DESI-II. We test a more realistic $u$-dropout LBG selection using early UNIONS data, which yields a denser sample of $r&lt;24.2$ objects at $1,400$ deg$^{-2}$. From this sample, covering a larger footprint and expected to have a higher large-scale galaxy bias, we forecast $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=20$, with similar precision achievable after DESI spectroscopic follow-up. In addition, we perform preliminary validation of the redshift distribution using the clustering-redshift method with DESI DR1 data, confirming the calibration from deep, small-area photometric fields. However, accounting for uncertainties in the clustering-redshift distribution significantly degrades the $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ constraining power.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints from future measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) will soon allow for the unprecedented detection of small-scale secondary anisotropies, such as the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. Linking the kSZ power spectrum to the properties of ionising sources would provide an opportunity to use such observations to access astrophysical and cosmological information from the Epoch of Reionisation, including the morphology of ionised regions, while simultaneously improving CMB analyses. The aim of this work is to assess this potential of the kSZ power spectrum to measure reionisation-era galaxy properties. We repurpose the publicly available LoReLi II simulations, which track the evolution of neutral hydrogen during reionisation, to generate a training set of patchy kSZ angular power spectra. We then train an emulator using neural network regression in order to allow for efficient Bayesian inference, and conduct forecasts assuming mock observations from current and future CMB experiments. We find that measurements of the kSZ power spectrum from such surveys can provide meaningful constraints on several of the astrophysical model parameters of the LoReLi II suite, including the ionising escape fraction for which we expect a 14% relative error, on average. They also provide an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth, marginalised over the astrophysics and with error bars competitive with the cosmic variance limit from large scale surveys. The kSZ power spectrum offers a promising avenue for probing the properties of reionisation-era galaxies and providing an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth with upcoming CMB experiments. Since the error budget of our mock observations is dominated by emulator reconstruction errors, we expect our results could be further improved with a more extended simulation training set.</description>

      <title>The life of central radio galaxies in clusters: AGN-ICM studies of eRASS1 clusters in the ASKAP fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical feedback from the central AGNs can be crucial for balancing the radiative cooling of the intracluster medium at the cluster centre. We aim to understand the relationship between the power of AGN feedback and the cooling of gas in the centres of galaxy clusters by correlating the radio properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with the X-ray properties of their host clusters. We used catalogues from the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) along with ASKAP radio data. In total, we identified 134 radio sources associated with BCGs of the 151 eRASS1 clusters located in the PS1, PS2, and SWAG-X ASKAP fields. Non-detections were treated as upper limits. We correlated BCG radio luminosity, largest linear size (LLS), and BCG offset with the integrated X-ray luminosity of their host clusters. To characterise cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs), we used the concentration parameter $c_{R_{500}}$ and combined it with the BCG offset to assess cluster dynamical state. We analysed the correlation between radio mechanical power and X-ray luminosity within the CC subsample. We observe a potential positive trend between LLS and BCG offset, suggesting an environmental effect on radio-source morphology. We find a weak trend where more luminous central radio galaxies are found in clusters with higher X-ray luminosity. Within the CC subsample, there is a positive but highly scattered relationship between the mechanical luminosity of AGN jets and the X-ray cooling luminosity. This finding is supported by bootstrap resampling and flux-flux analyses. The correlation indicates that AGN feedback is ineffective in high-luminosity (high-mass) clusters. At a cooling luminosity of $L_{\mathrm{X},~r&lt;R_\mathrm{cool}}\approx 5.50\times10^{43}$ erg/s, on average, AGN feedback appears to contribute only about 13%-22% of the energy needed to offset the radiative losses in the ICM.</description>

      <title>Clustering in dynamical dark energy: observational constraints from DESI, CMB, and supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the clustering properties of dynamical dark energy using the latest cosmological observations. We describe the dark energy perturbation within two complementary frameworks, namely the Parameterized Post-Friedmann (PPF) approach and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy. Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations together with Planck 2018 CMB data and the Union3 supernova sample, we constrain the effective sound speed of dark energy in both the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM backgrounds. Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \simeq 0.3$--$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $\Lambda$CDM reaches $3.42\sigma$, rising to $3.63\sigma$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19\sigma$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $\Lambda$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively.</description>

Abstract: Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest a significant preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) that exhibits the phantom-like behavior in the past and has transitioned into quintessence-like behavior today. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2\sigma$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $\Lambda$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence analysis indicates that the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, BA and Exponential models are moderately favored relative to $\Lambda$CDM based on the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of axion dark energy in supersymmetric models and constraints on high scale parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis is given of interacting dark energy and dark matter where the dark energy is assumed to be an ultralight axionic field with a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson potential which is in general a superposition of $N$ number of cosine terms motivated by supergravity and string models with a $U(1)$ global symmetry, where the symmetry is broken by instanton effects. The case $N=2$ is investigated in detail and a fit to cosmological data is performed where it is found that a better fit is obtained in comparison with the $N=1$ case. The fits also constrain high scale parameters, i.e., the axion decay constant which is determined to be sub-Planckian, a result consistent with string theory that disfavors trans-Planckian axion decay constant. Furthermore, the dark energy-dark matter interaction strength is constrained to be feeble, i.e., $\lambda\lesssim 4\times 10^{-6}$ m$_{\rm Pl}^{-2}$ Mpc$^{-2}$. We study possible implications of this type of potential on the Hubble tension and on the dynamics of the dark energy equation of state using the DESI-DR2 data. For the cases $N=3,4$, the analysis exhibits the phenomenon of transmutation even in the absence of coupling to dark matter, where thawing quintessence transmutes to freezing quintessence. The analysis is internally consistent in its treatment of the dark energy-dark matter interaction as it is based on an underlying Lagrangian, in contrast with several previous works where the sources are chosen in an ad hoc manner to satisfy energy conservation.</description>

      <title>The network analysis of the cosmic web as a tool to constrain cosmology and cosmic magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The spatial distribution of haloes in the Cosmic Web encodes a wealth of information about the underlying cosmological model. These haloes can be represented as nodes of a graph, whose structural properties reflect cosmological parameters. Aims. Using our new MAKITRA suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations covering a total volume of $(300\,\text{Mpc})^3$ and with 21 physical model variations (including variations of $\sigma_8$ and of different models of primordial magnetic fields, PMFs), we investigate the sensitivity of network-based statistics describing the Cosmic Web to variations in cosmological and PMF scenarios. Methods. We focus on several complementary metrics that characterise the spatial distribution of dark and baryonic matter haloes: two-point correlation functions, network-centrality statistics, and counts-in-cell measurements. We first compare the halo-halo correlation functions across different cosmological models. For the network analysis, we represent haloes as vertices of the Cosmic Web and compute multiple centrality measures, whose cumulative distributions we evaluate for universes with varying PMF strengths. Finally, we quantify halo abundances within randomly placed spheres of fixed radius to assess differences between scenarios. Results. First, we find that the statistics of the centralities of the network can serve as a novel sensitive probe of the cosmological parameter $\sigma_8$. Moreover, we find that this network analysis approach can allow us to distinguish the presence of PMFs with initial strength $\approx\,4 \text{nG}$ from the scenarios with much weaker PMFs.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraint on Primordial Black Hole Properties with the CSST $3\times2$pt Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study forecasts the constraints on the properties of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a cold dark matter component using the galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing (i.e. $3\times2$pt) measurements from the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) photometric survey. Since PBHs formed via gravitational collapse in the early Universe, they can additionally affect the formation and evolution of the cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) through the ``Poisson" effect. We compute the angular power spectra for PBH-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and generate mock data based on the CSST instrumental and survey design. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to constrain the free parameters, such as the product of the PBH fraction and mass $f_{\rm PBH}m_{\rm PBH}$ and other cosmological parameters. The systematic parameters are also included in the fitting process, such as the parameters of the baryonic effect, intrinsic alignment, galaxy bias, photometric redshift (photo-$z$) calibration, shear calibration, and noise terms. We find that the CSST 3$\times$2pt analysis can achieve tight constraints on $f_{\rm PBH}m_{\rm PBH}$, with 68% and 95% confidence levels (CLs) reaching $&lt;10^{3.9} M_{\odot}$ and $&lt;10^{4.7} M_{\odot}$, respectively. Additionally, the cosmological parameters, e.g. $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and $w$, can be constrained with the precisions of 3.3%, 1.7%, 13%, respectively. This indicates that the CSST 3$\times$2pt analysis is a powerful tool to advance the PBH dark matter studies in the near future.</description>

      <title>Skew-spectra: a generalization to spin-$s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skew-spectra allow us to extract non-Gaussian information by taking the square of a map and finding the power spectrum of this new map with the original map. This allows us to use much of the infrastructure of power spectra and avoid the intricacies of estimating three point statistics. In this paper we present the first extension of skew-spectra to arbitrary spin-$s$ fields, as a means to extract non-Gaussian information efficiently from cosmological data sets like cosmic shear or CMB polarization. We apply the formalism to weak lensing in the context of large scale structure, and discuss different ways of combining fields to build skew-spectra, all while avoiding the problems associated with mass-mapping. We provide plots of these new statistics for $\Lambda$CDM and vary cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity in SMICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new formalism for the component separation method Spectral Matching Independent Component Analysis (SMICA) in order to include the information contained in the foregrounds beyond second-order statistics. We also develop a binned bispectrum estimator that works directly using maps of different frequency channels, capable of determining the bispectrum of multiple components at the same time, shifting the traditional approach to non-Gaussianity estimation from a cleaned map to the component separation step, for a better handling of foreground uncertainty. We test our method on 400 E and B polarization simulations based on the LiteBIRD experiment, containing the two main sources of contamination for CMB polarization experiments: polarized dust and synchrotron emission. We show that the bispectrum does not improve the precision of the power spectrum estimation or of the spectral parameters. However, we are capable of recovering the correct 3-point correlator of the foregrounds and standard constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity in a coherent multi-frequency and multi-component framework. The advantage of our approach is that it combines data in an optimal way accounting for the power spectrum and the bispectrum of the various components, which is not true for the standard approach.</description>

      <title>Tracing Structure: Shape and Centroid Deviations in 39 Strong Lensing Clusters as a Test of Cluster Formation Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong lensing galaxy clusters provide a unique and powerful way to test simulation-derived structure predictions that follow from $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. Specifically, the relative alignments of the dark matter (DM) halo, stars, and hot intracluster gas in these clusters offer insights into how well theoretical structure predictions hold. We measure the position angles, ellipticities, and locations/centroids of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), the Intracluster Light (ICL), the hot Intracluster Medium (ICM), and the Core Lensing Mass (CLM) for a sample of strong lensing galaxy clusters from the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS). We measure the shapes (position angles and ellipticities) and centroids of these distributions using ellipse-fitting methods applied to different datasets: HST WFC3 imaging for the BCG and ICL, Chandra X-ray observations for the ICM, and strong-lensing mass reconstructions for the CLM. Additionally, we incorporate ICM morphological measures to classify the dynamical state of the cluster sample. Using this multi-component approach, we constrain the shape and centroids of these distributions in this sample and evaluate the different observable components in terms of their ability to trace the gravitational potential of their respective clusters. We find that misalignments between cluster components can be explained by astrophysical processes related to cluster assembly, relaxation, and merger histories. We find that the ICL is most closely aligned with its host DM halo, as traced by the CLM distribution, in both position angle and centroid. Additionally, we find that on average the ICL and CLM are more elliptical than the ICM and BCG.</description>

      <title>EMU and Euclid: Detection of a radio-optical galaxy clustering cross-correlation signal between the Evolutionary Map of the Universe and Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synergies between large-scale radio-continuum and optical/near-infrared galaxy surveys are a powerful tool for cosmology. Cross-correlating these surveys can constrain the redshift distribution of radio sources, mitigate systematic effects, and place constraints on cosmological models. We perform the first measurement of the clustering cross-spectrum between radio-continuum sources in the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey and galaxies from the ESA Euclid satellite mission's Q1 release. Our goal is to detect and characterise the cross-correlation signal, test its robustness against systematic effects, and compare our measurements with theoretical predictions. We use data from the Australian SKA Pathfinder's EMU Main Survey, which overlaps with the Euclid Deep Field South. We generate two radio-source catalogues using different source finders to create galaxy maps. We measure the harmonic-space cross-correlation signal using a pseudo-spectrum estimator. The measured signal is compared to theoretical predictions based on a {\Lambda}CDM cosmology, using several models for the EMU source redshift distribution and bias. We report detection above 8{\sigma} of the cross-correlation signal consistent across all tested models and data sets. The measured cross-spectra from the two radio catalogues are in excellent agreement, demonstrating that the cross-correlation is robust against the choice of source-finding algorithm. The measured signal also agrees with theoretical models developed from previous cross-correlation studies and simulations. This pathfinder study establishes a statistically significant cross-correlation between EMU and Euclid. The robustness of the signal is a crucial validation of the methodology, paving the way for future large-scale analyses leveraging the full power of this synergy to constrain cosmological parameters and our understanding of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The Shear-to-Cosmology Paradigm I: Hybrid Field-Level and Simulation-Based Framework for Weak Lensing Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise cosmological inference from next-generation weak lensing surveys requires extracting non-Gaussian information beyond standard two-point statistics. We present a hybrid machine-learning (ML) framework that integrates field-level inference (FLI) with simulation-based inference (SBI) to map observed shear fields directly to cosmological parameters, eliminating the need for convergence reconstruction. The FLI network extracts rich non-Gaussian information from the shear field to produce informative features, which are then used by SBI to model the resulting complex posteriors. To mitigate noise from intrinsic galaxy shapes, we develop a blind, training-free, PCA-based shear denoising method. Tests on CSST-like mock catalogs reveal significant performance gains. The shear-based inference achieves approximately twice the cosmological constraining power in Figure of Merit (FoM) compared to the conventional convergence-based approach. Moreover, the combination of PCA denoising and ML compression can deliver a 36.4% improvement in FoM over standard shear two-point statistics. This work establishes a scalable and robust pathway for cosmological inference, unlocking the full potential of Stage-IV weak-lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Axion Domain Wall Induced by Helical Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable domain wall (DW) must decay to avoid overclose the Universe. A commonly used solution is to slightly break the PQ symmetry by introducing a bias term in the potential. In this work, we propose an alternative, symmetry-preserving mechanism: coupling the axion field to a helical primordial magnetic field (PMF) via the Chern-Simons term. Using three-dimensional lattice simulations, we evolve the DW network and demonstrate that it can successfully drive DW decay. Our quantitative results further show that the correlation length of the PMF plays a crucial role in determining the decay rate of the DW network and the resulting axion and gravitational wave radiation.</description>

      <title>High-resolution cosmological simulations of primordial dark matter clustering under long-range and fractional forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range attractive fifth forces can lead to exponential instabilities in the early Universe. For fermions with a Yukawa coupling to a sufficiently light scalar mediator, rapid oscillations of the scalar field can lead to a conservative force law with fractional behaviour on sufficiently large scales. We study cosmological systems evolving under both this fractional potential and the Newtonian potential using high-resolution N-body simulations. We find that, at the same mass scale, halos that form under the fractional potential are much more dense than those that from the Newtonian potential. However, we also find that the perturbed scalar field may have large fluctuations once halo sizes become comparable to an effective Compton length, which will modify subsequent clustering and collapse.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark matter halo profiles with symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter and the Tachyonic Trap During Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that resonant processes during multi-field inflation can generate a large curvature perturbation on small scales. This perturbation naturally leads to the formation of primordial black holes that may constitute dark matter, as well as to the production of stochastic induced gravitational waves in the deci-Hz band. Such waves are within reach of future space-based interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO and BBO. In addition, primordial black hole binaries formed at late times produce merger gravitational waves that can be probed by the resonant cavity experiments in addition to DECIGO and BBO.</description>

      <title>Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential revisited in the context of Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warm Inflation is a scenario in which the inflaton field dissipates its energy during inflation to maintain a subdominant constant radiation bath. Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</description>

      <title>Detection of the Pairwise Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect and Pairwise Velocity with DESI DR1 Galaxies and ACT DR6 and Planck CMB Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 9.3-sigma detection of the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect by combining a sample of 913,286 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1) catalog and co-added Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature maps. This represents the highest-significance pairwise kSZ measurement to date. The analysis uses three ACT CMB temperature maps: co-added 150 GHz, total frequency maps, and a component-separated Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map, all of which cover 19,000 square degrees of the sky from Advanced ACTPol observations conducted between 2017 and 2022. Comparison of the results of these three maps serves as a consistency check for potential foreground contamination that may depend on the observation frequency. An estimate of the best-fit mass-averaged optical depth is obtained by comparing the pairwise kSZ curve with the linear-theory prediction of the pairwise velocity under the best-fit Planck cosmology, and is compared with predictions from simulations. This estimate serves as a reference point for future comparisons with thermal SZ-derived optical depth measurements for the same DESI cluster samples, which will be presented in a companion paper. Finally, we employ a machine-learning approach trained on simulations to estimate the optical depth for 456,803 DESI LRG-identified clusters within the simulated mass range (greater than about 1e13 solar masses). These are combined with the measured kSZ signal to infer the individual cluster peculiar velocities, providing the opportunity to constrain the behavior of gravity and the dark sector over a range of cosmic scales and epochs.</description>

      <title>Inflation Driven by Scalar-Neutrino Coupling in a Mass-Varying Neutrino Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a cosmological framework in which neutrino masses evolve dynamically through coupling with a scalar field that simultaneously drives inflation. The neutrino mass is modeled as a power-law, exponential, or hybrid function of the scalar field, yielding an effective potential that includes neutrino backreaction. Starting from the Einstein-Hilbert action in a flat FLRW background, we derive the modified Friedmann and Klein Gordon equations incorporating this coupling. Using the Fermi-Dirac integrals, we account for the continuous transition of neutrinos from relativistic to non-relativistic regimes. The inflationary dynamics are analyzed via the slow roll parameters derived from the effective potential. Our results show that the scalar neutrino coupling alters the potential slope and curvature, thereby influencing the duration of inflation. The hybrid coupling form provides the most flexible realization, unifying neutrino mass generation with early universe inflation within a single scalar field framework.</description>

      <title>A measurement of $H_0$ from DESI DR1 using energy densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new measurement of the Hubble constant, independent of standard rulers and robust to pre-recombination modifications such as Early Dark Energy (EDE), obtained by calibrating the total energy density of the Universe. We start using the present-day photon density as an anchor, and use the baryon-to-photon ratio from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis based measurements and the baryon-to-matter ratio from the baryons' imprint on galaxy clustering to translate to a physical matter density at present day. We then compare this to measurements of the ratio of the matter density to the critical density ($\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$), calculated using the relative positions of the baryon acoustic oscillations, to measure the critical density of the universe and hence $H_0$. The important measurements of the evolution of the energy density all happen at low redshift, so we consider this a low-redshift measurement. We validate our method both on a suite of $N$-body mocks and on noiseless theory vectors generated across a wide range of Hubble parameters in both $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmologies. Using DESI DR1 data combined with the angular CMB acoustic scale and the latest BBN constraints, we find $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with existing early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant. We consider the impact of non-standard dark energy evolution on our measurement. Future data, including that from further iterations of DESI and from Euclid, will add to these results providing a powerful test of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Baryon fraction from the BAO amplitude: a consistent approach to parameterizing perturbation growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clustering constrains the baryon fraction Omega_b/Omega_m through the amplitude of baryon acoustic oscillations and the suppression of perturbations entering the horizon before recombination. This produces a different pre-recombination distribution of baryons and dark matter. After recombination, the gravitational potential responds to both components in proportion to their mass, allowing robust measurement of the baryon fraction. This is independent of new-physics scenarios altering the recombination background (e.g. Early Dark Energy). The accuracy of such measurements does, however, depend on how baryons and CDM are modeled in the power spectrum. Previous template-based splitting relied on approximate transfer functions that neglected part of information. We present a new method that embeds an extra parameter controlling the balance between baryons and dark matter in the growth terms of the perturbation equations in the CAMB Boltzmann solver. This approach captures the baryonic suppression of CDM prior to recombination, avoids inconsistencies, and yields a clean parametrization of the baryon fraction in the linear power spectrum, separating out the simple physics of growth due to the combined matter potential. We implement this framework in an analysis pipeline using Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure with HOD-informed priors and validate it against noiseless LCDM and EDE cosmologies with DESI-like errors. The new scheme achieves comparable precision to previous splitting while reducing systematic biases, providing a more robust way to baryon-fraction measurements. In combination with BBN constraints on the baryon density and Alcock-Paczynski estimates of the matter density, these results strengthen the use of baryon fraction measurements to derive a Hubble constant from energy densities, with future DESI and Euclid data expected to deliver competitive constraints.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Mixing and the Phantom Illusion: Axion-Dilaton Quintessence in Light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from DESI BAO analyses suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant and is in fact dynamical. Furthermore, the data suggest that the equation of state may have been in the phantom regime in the distant past, recently undergoing a phantom crossing. In this work, we investigate whether this preference can be realized within a kinetically mixed axion-dilaton (KMIX) quintessence model, a string-motivated system in which an axion-like field couples exponentially to a dilaton-like (moduli) field. Crucially, KMIX can appear phantom in a standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) based analysis. To confront the model with data, we develop a fast pipeline based on normalizing flows that (i) learns a theory-informed prior on $(w_0,w_a)$ from KMIX realizations and (ii) provides an inverse mapping from CPL parameters back to the physical KMIX parameters. By importance-sampling pre-computed CPL chains using this framework, we effectively transform generic phenomenological constraints into direct, computationally efficient constraints on the underlying KMIX theory, avoiding the prohibitive cost of full parameter space exploration. Applied to Planck+DESI DR2 BAO measurements, our framework finds support for KMIX at $2.5\sigma$ compared to the base CPL fit at $3.1\sigma$, demonstrating that KMIX may account for the DESI preference without invoking true phantom behavior. When additionally including Type Ia supernovae data, we find that the preference remains above $3\sigma$ for Union3 and DES Y5, but drops to $2.1\sigma$ with Pantheon+. The latter, combined with the DESI full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum data, further reduces the preference to $1.7\sigma$. Ultimately, should the DESI deviation persist with future data, KMIX may offer a theoretically well-motivated explanation for the phantom-like signatures inferred from phenomenological fits.</description>

      <title>Probing Exotic Astrophysical Dark objects through Astrometric Microlensing from Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of astrometric microlensing by exotic astrophysical dark objects, focusing on two theoretically motivated models -- Q-ball and boson star. We demonstrate that these extended objects generate distinctive signatures that depart markedly from point-mass lenses like primordial black holes. The smoking-gun signature for these exotic objects is the emergence of caustics, which form when the lens radius is below a critical threshold. Crossing these caustics induces discontinuous jumps in the images-centroid trajectory, a distinctive feature of these extended dark objects. We show these patterns are sensitive to the internal mass profile, with boson stars generating larger, more prominent caustic structures than Q-balls -- enabling the models to be distinguished. Using the Gaia DR3 stellar catalogue, we forecast a high-yield discovery potential, up to $\sim 6000$ detectable astrometric microlensing events for a 10-year mission, peaking for $M \sim 1-10~M_\odot$ and $R \lesssim 10~\text{AU}$. In the absence of anomalous detections, Gaia can set powerful 90% confidence level constraints on the fractional abundance of these exotic objects, reaching $f_{\mathrm{DM}} \le 10^{-3}$ in the peak region which covers masses from $10^{-1}-10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and radii $R&lt;10^{6}~\text{AU}$. Crucially, these projected astrometric microlensing constraints are significantly stronger than existing photometric microlensing limits in the $1-10~M_\odot$ mass range. This work establishes astrometric microlensing with Gaia as a powerful, complementary, and near-future probe with the potential to discover exotic astrophysical dark objects.</description>

      <title>LYRA ultra-faints: The emergence of faint dwarf galaxies in the presence of an early Lyman-Werner background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a suite of zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies using the LYRA galaxy formation model with an extremely high mass resolution of $4\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, evolved to $z=0$. The suite contains 65 haloes selected from Local Group like environments, spanning $M_{\mathrm{200c}}=10^7$ to $5\times10^9\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The sample includes small ultra-faints with $M_\ast\sim100\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ through to classical dwarfs with $M_\ast \sim 5\times10^6 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, as well as haloes that remain dark to the present day. We explore two prescriptions for the high-redshift ($z&gt;7$) Lyman-Werner background (LWB), differing in intensity and redshift evolution. Star formation begins early ($z\gtrsim8$) in progenitors with $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^5$-$10^6 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, where molecular hydrogen enables warm moderate-density gas to efficiently cool. The LWB strongly influences the $z=0$ halo occupation fraction, shifting the dark-to-luminous transition from $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^7 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ (weaker LWB) to $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^8 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ (stronger LWB). Galaxies with $M_\ast\gtrsim10^5 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ are mostly insensitive to the LWB choice, whereas lower mass systems respond strongly, producing markedly different stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relations. The weaker LWB yields a very shallow SMHM slope with nearly constant scatter, while the stronger LWB introduces a pronounced break at $M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim10^9 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, where haloes of similar mass host galaxies with $M_\ast\sim10^3$ to $10^5 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ or remain dark. Both models produce a minimum stellar mass floor at $M_\ast\sim10^3 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, originating from galaxies that undergo a single burst of star formation at high redshift before self-quenching from their first supernovae.</description>

      <title>Bubble Nucleation from Boson Star Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new classical mechanism for nucleation of bubbles of true vacuum. The mechanism arises when dense boson stars form in the false vacuum. As the boson stars collapse due to attractive self-interactions, the field inside the stars core is enhanced beyond the potential barrier. Subsequently the stars explode as true vacuum bubbles, and induce a cosmological phase transition. The mechanism raises the possibility that a vacuum that is stable against quantum tunneling can be vulnerable to ``astrophysical'' processes.</description>

      <title>Data span and frequency coverage requirements for robust detection and inference in PTAs: A case study with EPTA DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) are approaching the sensitivity required for a $5\sigma$ detection of the nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB). This makes it crucial to deeply understand the behaviour of our analysis pipelines. A counterintuitive feature of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) second data release is that restricting the dataset to the last 10.3 years (DR2new) increases the inferred GWB significance from $\leq2\sigma$ for the full 25-year dataset (DR2full) to $\geq3.5\sigma$. We investigate whether this behaviour indicates an anomaly or is a possible outcome of the pipeline. Using realistic, DR2-like simulations with varying timespans, we find that the first 10 years contribute little to the GWB evidence due to their limited frequency coverage. This produces substantial overlap between the HD S/N distributions of DR2full and DR2new. Random noise fluctuations therefore yield a higher GWB evidence in DR2new than in DR2full in $15\%$ of cases. Furthermore, $5\%$ of simulations match the HD S/N of the real data, indicating that the observed behaviour is consistent with being a $\sim2\sigma$ outcome due to noise fluctuations. Regardless of significance, DR2new simulations introduce biases in the GWB parameter estimation due to spectral leakage effects that are ignored in standard analyses and which flatten the inferred spectrum. Including leakage removes these biases, demonstrating the reliability of DR2new when the signal is properly modelled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining EPTA DR2full with long-baseline data from NANOGrav and PPTA, as well as low-frequency data from LOFAR and NenuFAR, significantly enhances GWB evidence and parameter accuracy. Finally, we examine the impact of the observation timespan and find that short-baseline datasets introduce strong amplitude biases and are ineffective at constraining the GWB.</description>

      <title>Searches for Post-Merger Gravitational Waves with CoCoA: Sensitivity Projections Across Large Template Banks for Current and Next-Generation Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-messenger detection of the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 has revolutionized the field of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, several important questions remain to be answered. One of these is the nature of the compact remnant leftover by GW170817 (short- or long-lived NS versus black hole). A key goal going forward is to understand the diversity of NS-NS merger remnants, and how such diversity maps onto their viability as gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines. Here, we present a study aimed at assessing the sensitivity of triggered searches for intermediate-duration, post-merger GWs powered by long-lived GRB remnants using networks of current and future ground-based GW detectors and the Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA). We develop a Python-based framework to efficiently estimate CoCoA distance horizons for a broad range of post merger secular bar-mode waveforms and for different GW detector networks.

      <title>Lorentz Violation in Emergent Gravity and Its Cosmological Consequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that General Relativity and other geometrical theories can be viewed as a degenerate Otto cycle with only heat-exchange legs in emergent gravity. Including work-producing legs yields controlled violations of local Lorentz invariance and energy-momentum conservation, which produce late-time cosmological acceleration. Implications for the cosmological constant problem, structure formation and local observations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Misalignment dynamics of Scalar Condensates with Yukawa coupling: Particle and Entropy Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misalignment dynamics, the non-equilibrium evolution of a scalar (or pseudoscalar) condensate in a potential landscape, broadly describes a solution to the strong CP problem, a mechanism for cold dark matter production and (pre) reheating post inflation. Often, radiative corrections are included phenomenologically by replacing the potential by the effective potential which is a \emph{static quantity}, its usefulness is restricted to (near) equilibrium situations. We study the misalignment dynamics of a scalar condensate Yukawa coupled to $N_f$ fermions in a manifestly energy conserving, fully renormalized Hamiltonian framework. A large $N_f$ limit allows us to focus on the fermion degrees of freedom, which yield a negative contribution to the effective potential, a radiatively induced instability and ultraviolet divergent field renormalization. We introduce an adiabatic basis and an adiabatic expansion that embodies the derivative expansion in the effective action, the zeroth order is identified with the effective potential, higher orders account for the derivative expansion including field renormalization and describe profuse particle production. Energy conserving dynamics leads to the conjecture of emergent asymptotic highly excited stationary states with a distribution function $n_k(\infty)\propto 1/k^6$ and an extensive entropy which is identified with an entanglement entropy. Subtle aspects of renormalization associated with the initial value problem are analyzed and resolved. Possible new manifestations of asymptotic spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) as a consequence of the dynamics even in absence of tree level (SSB), and cosmological inferences are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinite towers of higher-order corrections to General Relativity have been proposed as a mechanism to resolve singularities in early-universe cosmology and black holes, in a variety of settings. In this work, we consider an infinite tower of higher-order Proca corrections inspired by dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. We find that the Big Bang singularity present in General Relativity is replaced by an inflationary epoch. Furthermore, the Lovelock-Proca tower allows for regular planar black hole solutions and spherically symmetric black holes with primary hair.</description>

      <title>Scalar field effective potentials in de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two different definitions of a scalar field effective potential in quantum field theory in de Sitter spacetime: the standard textbook definition, and the constraint effective potential proposed by O'Raifeartaigh et al. in 1986. While these definitions are equivalent in Minkowski spacetime, they differ significantly in de Sitter. We demonstrate this by computing them both explicitly at one-loop order in perturbation theory. It is well known that the perturbative expansion of the standard effective potential fails converge for light fields. In contrast, the constraint effective potential does not suffer from this infrared problem, and it can therefore be computed using perturbation theory. We discuss the physical interpretation of the two effective potentials. In particular, we provide evidence supporting an earlier conjecture that the constraint effective potential is the correct one to use in the stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama theory.</description>

      <title>An improved formalism for measuring the dark matter subhalos mass by its gravitational wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reexamined the framework used to determine the dark matter mass of a subhalo using the gravitational effects of its passage upon the stellar halo of a host. In particular, we aim to include different density distribution functions for the perturber and a non homogeneous background due to the host's halo gravitational potential. We have used a sample of K giant and RRLyrae stars based on Gaia DR3 data and two different set of simulations, to test the new formalism. From our analysis, we found that the inclusion of a nonhomogeneous background improves substantially the estimation of the subhalo dark matter mass. The methodology is not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between different density distribution functions for the perturber, however, in the case of the observational data, the inclussion of the cloud's circular velocity is a fundamental tool to complement the analysis. The results obtained including the host halo potential agree with the independent previous measurements or with the reported value for the subhalo dark matter mass in the simulations. These results show that it is possible to measure the mass of smaller subhalos through their gravitational wake, even for subhalos closer to their host, with distances lower than 30 kpc.</description>

      <title>Vector-field spontaneous baryogenesis with Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend spontaneous baryogenesis by considering the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$ through a complex vector field. This field interacts with baryons and leptons via a vector-current coupling and, by construction, acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Accordingly, the theory also exhibits a spontaneous violation of Lorentz invariance, effectively realizing a Bumblebee model. In this picture, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)_B$ global symmetry is the global phase of the Bumblebee vector and, in the broken phase, it results minimally coupled with the baryonic current, guaranteeing the violation of the baryon number. Consequently, we assume that the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone, arising from spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$, plays the role of the inflaton, leading to baryogenesis across the entire inflationary stage, up to when the inflaton decays into baryon-antilepton and antibaryon-lepton pairs through a CP-violating interaction that also violates the Lorentz symmetry. Afterwards, we address the issue of flavor oscillations among baryon and lepton fields, including the oscillation probability in the calculation of the baryon asymmetry. Remarkably, our framework predicts a non-null mixing factor even for massless fermions. This mixing acts on the spatial momenta rather than on the masses of the produced fermions, allowing larger values of the coupling constant even guaranteeing the production of light fermions. The net baryon asymmetry results accordingly modified, and may also reproduce the experimental data for allowed values of the coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement features of primordial non-gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss some entanglement features associated with cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in single-field inflationary scenarios. We adopt standard momentum-space techniques to show how multipartite entanglement arises for inflationary perturbation modes, focusing on the dynamics of the comoving curvature perturbation. In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a higher-dimensional universe that is a product of Minkowski space and the non-orientable Klein Bottle. The topology explicitly breaks important symmetries, such as translational invariance and (5+1)-dimensional CP invariance. Somewhat surprisingly, the (3+1)-dimensional cp of the Minkowski space can also be broken by the Klein Bottle, both explicitly and in the presence of a brane. The topology enforces a background of fermion correlations that amounts to a condensate wall localized in the Klein Bottle. The wall acts as an order parameter for the broken symmetries. If a brane passes through the wall, brane fermions that couple to the condensate are produced as quantified by the Bogoliubov coefficients for a time-dependent mass. The scenario meets the conditions, including cp violation, to potentially generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>From metallicity distributions to mutual information: A new perspective on stellar halo assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metallicity structure of stellar halos encodes the fossil record of galaxy assembly, tracing the chemical evolution and dynamical imprint of past mergers. Using five Milky Way-mass halos from the Aquarius simulations, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to quantify spatial-chemical correlations through the mutual information (MI) between angular position and metallicity. We divide stars in each halo into high- and low-metallicity populations based on their median metallicity and examine their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), spatial anisotropies, and angular-metallicity couplings as a function of galactocentric radius. The MDFs exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from single-peaked distributions dominated by one or two massive progenitors to broad or bimodal forms shaped by multiple accretion events, revealing the stochastic nature of halo assembly. The low-metallicity stars, primarily contributed by disrupted satellites, display higher spatial anisotropy and stronger angular clustering than their metal-rich counterparts. After removing bound satellites, anisotropy decreases significantly, yet high-metallicity stars remain marginally more anisotropic, reflecting the lingering debris of massive, centrally deposited progenitors. The mutual information between angular position and metallicity increases with radius before saturating in the outskirts, with the difference between the data and randomized controls confined mainly to the inner halo signifying residual spatial-chemical coupling driven by incomplete phase mixing. Our results demonstrate that information-theoretic diagnostics provide a powerful and intuitive way to quantify the chemical complexity of stellar halos and offer a promising route to compare simulations with forthcoming high-dimensional Galactic survey data.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints of diffusive dark-fluid cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02913v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate late-time cosmology and the evolution of cosmic structures using an interacting dark fluid model in which dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) interact through a diffusive mechanism. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we derive the background evolution and perturbation equations within this model and obtain cosmological parameters through MCMC simulations. We use recent measurements for statistical analysis and constrain the parameters $H_0$ in km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_m$, $r_d$, $M$, $\sigma_8$, $S_8$, and the interaction term $Q_{dm}$. From the constrained values of $Q_{dm}$, we show that the diffusive model is a promising alternative DE model, capable of driving late-time cosmic acceleration due to energy exchange from DM to DE. State-finder diagnostics indicate that the model behaves like a Chaplygin gas when energy transfers from DM to DE during the Universe's expansion. We also investigate the growth of density contrast, finding $\delta_m(z)\gg\delta_{de}(z)$, which highlights the dominant role of DM in structure formation. Redshift space distortion and growth rate analysis show that minor deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at low redshifts, with larger differences at higher redshifts, indicate the impact of energy diffusion on early structure growth. Finally, we perform a detailed statistical analysis, including ${\mathcal{L}(\hat{\Theta}|data)}$, $\chi^2$, $\rm{AIC}$, and $\rm{BIC}$, which strongly supports the proposed diffusive dark-fluid model.</description>

Abstract: We present the first joint-likelihood analysis of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Bayesian inference is performed on the baryon abundance and the effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, using a CMB Boltzmann solver in combination with LINX, a new flexible and efficient BBN code. We marginalize over Planck nuisance parameters and nuclear rates to find $N_{\rm{eff}} = 3.08_{-0.13}^{+0.13},\,2.94 _{-0.16}^{+0.16},$ or $2.98_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$, for three separate reaction networks. This framework enables robust testing of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter paradigm and its variants with CMB and BBN data.</description>

By leveraging JAX, LINX achieves both speed and differentiability, enabling the use of Bayesian inference, including gradient-based methods. We discuss the formalism used in LINX for rapid primordial elemental abundance predictions and give examples of how LINX can be used. When combined with differentiable Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum emulators, LINX can be used for joint CMB and BBN analyses without requiring extensive computational resources, including on personal hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The galaxy--Lyman-$\alpha$ cross-correlation (GaLaCC) is a promising tool to study the interplay of galaxies and inter-galactic medium (IGM) in the first billion years of the Universe. Here we thoroughly characterise the impact of observational limitations on our ability to retrieve the intrinsic GaLaCC and provide new physical insights on its origin and connection to other IGM properties. This is extremely relevant to identify promising datasets, design future surveys and assess the limitations of current measurements. We find that sightline-to-sightline variations demand at least 25 independent sightlines to quantitatively recover the true signal. Once this condition is met, the intrinsic signal can be recovered even for a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution. The galaxy selection method does not affect the inferred GaLaCC and lightcone effects are only relevant for redshift windows $\Delta z \gtrsim 0.5$. We discuss the implications of these findings for previous theoretical studies. We elucidate explicitly for the first time the physical origin of the GaLaCC and demonstrate that this signal is collectively sourced by the ensemble of galaxies residing in overdense regions rather than individual objects. We show that GaLaCC measured for opaque sightlines shows a larger peak at smaller scales with respect to transparent lines of sight. We connect this to the evolution of the mean free path of ionizing photons, showing that GaLaCC peak position has a very similar evolution but on smaller scales, as it probes only the core of ionised regions. Finally, we discuss which ongoing surveys can be used to measure the GaLaCC and provide an initial analysis of future developments, including using galaxies as background sources. Our results outline a bright future for the GaLaCC as a tool to unveil the galaxy-IGM interplay during the first billion years of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background anisotropies from inflation with non-Bunch-Davies states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) have anisotropies generated by squeezed-type tensor non-Gaussianities originating from scalar-tensor-tensor (STT) and tensor-tensor-tensor cubic interactions. While the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities in the standard slow-roll inflation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are suppressed due to the so-called consistency relation, those in extended models with the violation of the consistency relation can be enhanced. Among such extended models, we consider the inflation model with the non-Bunch-Davies state that is known to enhance the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities. We explicitly formulate the primordial STT bispectrum induced during inflation in the context of Horndeski theory with the non-Bunch-Davies state and show that the induced SGWB anisotropies can be enhanced. We then discuss the detectability of those anisotropies in future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>The dynamical and thermodynamic effects of turbulence for the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>

Abstract: Both simulations and observations indicate that the so-called missing baryons reside in the intergalactic medium (IGM) known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this paper, we employ the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation to demonstrate that turbulence in the cosmic baryonic fluid is crucial for correctly understanding both the spatial distribution and the physical origins of the missing baryons in the universe. First, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in low-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon fractions, while prevent the convergence of the gas in high-density regions, leading to low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal energy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially reached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in a steady state within this redshift range. Due to turbulent heating, as redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is heated and transitions into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas. We find that, compared with turbulence in the cosmic fluid, shocks are unimportant in intermediate-density regions and even negligible in high-density regions, both dynamically and thermodynamically. This finding not only provides the origin of WHIM in terms of both dynamics and thermodynamics, but also questions the traditional view of the shock heating and highlights the importance of turbulence in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe, particularly in the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. In addition to TNG50-1, we validated our key findings with TNG50-2, TNG100-1, WIGEON, and EAGLE simulations, demonstrating that resolution, box size, and subgrid-physics variations do not affect our main conclusions.</description>

      <title>A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism</title>

Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply and test our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.</description>

      <title>A New Wavelet Scattering Transform-Based Statistic for Cosmological Analysis of Large-Scale Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale structure (LSS) analysis in galaxy surveys is a powerful cosmological probe but is limited by tracer bias, which can obscure underlying information and weaken parameter constraints. Existing methods either model bias or restrict analyses to low-density regions, yet their sensitivity to bias remains poorly understood. We propose a novel method based on the wavelet scattering transform (WST) to distinguish LSS across cosmological models while mitigating tracer bias. Central to our approach are the WST $m$-mode ratios, $R^{\rm wst}$, a new statistical measure, and a high-density apodization preprocessing that smoothly rescales extreme values. We use a reduced chi-square to assess the cosmological parameter constraints and find that $R^{\rm wst}$, in the scale range $j \in [3,7]$, achieves $\chi^2_{\nu, \rm cos} \approx 6$ for cosmology while maintaining $\chi^2_{\nu, \rm bias} \sim 1$--a regime unattained by other statistics. $R^{\rm wst}$ thus provides robust cosmological sensitivity with effective bias mitigation for future surveys.</description>

Abstract: Modelling star-forming galaxies is crucial for upcoming observations of large-scale matter and galaxy distributions with galaxy redshift surveys and line intensity mapping (LIM). We introduce CosmoGLINT (Cosmological Generative model for Line INtensity mapping with Transformer), a Transformer-based generative framework designed to create realistic galaxy populations from dark matter (DM)-only simulations. CosmoGLINT auto-regressively generates sequences of galaxy properties -- including star formation rate (SFR), distance to the halo centre, and radial and tangential velocities relative to the halo -- conditioned on halo mass. Trained on the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation, the model reproduces key statistical properties of the original data, including the voxel intensity distribution and the power spectrum both in real and redshift space. It can efficiently generate a number of different realisations of the designated galaxy populations, enabling the creation of mock LIM/redshift survey catalogues from large halo catalogues produced by fast DM-only simulations. We show that our model trained at multiple redshifts can be applied to DM halo lightcone data to generate a realistic mock galaxy lightcone with incorporating the redshift evolution of the galaxy population. The mock catalogues can be readily used to derive statistical quantities and to develop data analysis pipelines for ongoing and future wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$, are $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Direct correlation of line intensity mapping and CMB lensing from evolution along the lightcone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) promises to probe previously inaccessible corners of the faint and high-redshift universe. However, confusion with bright foregrounds is a major challenge for current-era pathfinder LIM experiments. Cross-correlation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing is a promising avenue to enable the first LIM detections at high redshifts, a pristine probe of fundamental physics but sparsely populated by faint galaxies, and to further probe the connection between matter and spectral line emission, expanding our understanding of galaxies and the IGM. Previous works have suggested that this direct correlation between LIM and CMB lensing is effectively impossible because smoothly varying modes in the intensity map are lost to bright foregrounds. In this work, we analytically revisit the direct correlation of foreground-filtered line intensity mapping with CMB lensing, highlighting lightcone evolution's previously neglected yet unavoidable and crucial effects. Indeed, the growth of structure and evolution of line emission along the lightcone breaks statistical translational invariance and thus induces mode coupling, even in linear theory, which enables the recovery of the smoothly varying modes lost to bright foregrounds. We compute the effects of these lightcone evolution-induced mode couplings on the LIMxCMB lensing cross-spectrum detectability, predicting that future wider-sky versions of COMAP and CCAT will be able to precisely measure this cross-correlation. Although we focus on the direct correlation of LIM with CMB lensing in this paper, our arguments generalize to the direct correlation of LIM with any projected field.</description>

      <title>The Filament Rift: $\Lambda$CDM's Structural Challenge Against Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the first extended comparison of cosmic filaments identified in SDSS DR10 observations ($z &lt; 0.05$) and the IllustrisTNG300-1 $\Lambda$CDM simulation ($z = 0$), utilizing the novel GrAviPaSt filament-finder method. The analyses are performed on both macro- and micro-filaments, each characterized by their length, thickness, and contrast in mass density. In addition to total sample comparisons, two subcategories of micro-filaments, GG (linking galaxy groups) and CC (linking galaxy clusters), are introduced to further analyze discrepancies between the $\Lambda$CDM model and observation. While $\Lambda$CDM produces extended macro-filaments, such structures are largely absent in SDSS, and where present, they exhibit higher densities than their simulated counterparts. Micro-filaments also show notable density discrepancies: at fixed length and thickness, observational filaments are significantly denser than those in the simulation. Employing radial density profiles reveal that micro-filaments in the $\Lambda$CDM simulation exhibit higher contrasts in mass density relative to the background compared to their observational counterparts. Notably, CC type micro-filaments displayed enhanced density contrasts over GG types in the simulation, while observational data showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, SDSS galaxies in both GG and CC micro-filaments exhibit lower specific star formation rates (sSFR) and older stellar populations, while TNG300-1 micro-filaments host more actively star-forming galaxies within the intermediate stellar mass range. These results reveal persistent discrepancies between observational data and the $\Lambda$CDM reconstruction of cosmic filaments, pointing to possible tensions in our current understanding of large-scale structures and their environmental effects on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Field-level Reconstruction from Foreground-Contaminated 21-cm Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current and upcoming 21-cm experiments will soon be able to map 21-cm spatial fluctuations in three dimensions for a wide range of redshifts. However, bright foreground contamination and the nature of radio interferometry create significant challenges, making it difficult to access rich cosmological information from the Fourier modes that lie within the "foreground wedge". In this work, we introduce two approaches aiming to reconstruct the full 21-cm density field, including the missing modes in the wedge: (a) a field-level inference under an effective field theory (EFT) framework; (b) a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on simulations. Under the EFT framework, we implement a fully differentiable forward model that maps the initial conditions of matter fluctuations to the observed, foreground-filtered 21-cm maps. This enables a gradient-based sampler to simultaneously sample the initial conditions and bias parameters, allowing a physically motivated mode reconstruction. Alternatively, we apply a variational diffusion model to perform 21-cm density reconstruction at the map level. Our model is trained on semi-numerical simulations over a wide range of astrophysical parameters. Our results from both approaches should provide improved cosmological constraints from the field level and also enable cross-correlation between experiments that have little or no overlapping modes.</description>

      <title>Constraining deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the Hubble expansion rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM cosmolgical model has long been regarded as highly successful in accurately describing a wide range of astronomical observations. However, numerous observational findings have also provided hints of discrepancies from the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario, which is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\rm \Lambda CDM}(\Omega_m, z)[1+\delta(z)]$. We consider three distinct forms for the deviation parameter $\delta(z)$: in model I, $\delta(z)=\delta_c$; in model II, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and in model III, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}{\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\delta_c$ represents a constant value. We utilize a comprehensive set of observational data to constrain the models. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\delta_c$ tends to take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive values in model III. Furthermore, we find that both models I and II remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. In contrast, model III exhibits a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding $2\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The AIC indicates that models I and II are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model being disfavored for the combined datasets DESI BAO + CMB + CC + DESY5. These results suggest that the Hubble expansion rate likely deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction.</description>

Abstract: Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant ($H_0$), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods. In this study, we present an improved strong lens mass modeling analysis of the cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal, incorporating the latest spectroscopic redshift data from the MUSE on the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope CANUCS/Technicolor. The robustness of our lens models is confirmed using the Jackknife method. From our analysis that considers four lens mass models with different assumptions on profiles of dark matter halos and external perturbations, we derive a constraint on the Hubble constant of $H_0=66.0\pm{4.3}\Mpc$ after combining best-fitted values of the four lens models.</description>

      <title>Evidence for increasing dark energy in DESI from the Local Distance Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. A comprehensive survey of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) in the Large Scale Structure (LSS), in stratified data covering a finite redshift range is provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Extracting cosmological parameters in a joint analysis of LSS-CMB data is hereby inherently a nonlinear problem. Aims. In particular, this nonlinearity may concern the unknown equation of state of dark energy w(a), defined in the general w(a)CDM framework. Nevertheless, a common approach is the linearized approximation hereto notably w0waCDM, also applied by DESI. Here, we consider a potential source of a systematic uncertainty in this linearization due to non-commutativity between w0waCDM and a posteriori linearization of w(a)CDM, identified with an intrinsic symmetry in the latter, which is violated in the former. We shall refer to these as early and late linearization, respectively. Methods. Observational consequences of symmetry violation is inherent to early linearization regardless of choice of data, here elucidated in the analysis of the Hubble expansion in the Local Distance Ladder (LDL) using cosmic chronometer data. Results. Strikingly, opposite results are found for the evolution of dark energy by early versus late linearization, indicating a thawing or respectively, increasing dark energy. This is further confirmed by mock data experiments. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the DESI pipeline is immune to the same contradiction. Conclusions. Our results show rather than thawing, claimed by DESI, dark energy may in fact be increasing upon preserving the underlying symmetry. Further confirmation is expected from Euclid.</description>

      <title>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited: II. Rotational Halo Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The peak model of structure formation was built more than fifty years ago with the aim to address the origin of dark matter halo rotation in the tidal torque theory (TTT). Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation, which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.</description>

      <title>Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis. V. Hubble tension, the cosmological constant and aperiodic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the appearance and specific properties of the structures in the local Universe by means of the Vlasov kinetic technique. We consider the role of the cosmological constant in local structure formation via the theorem on the general function that satisfies the identity of the gravity of the sphere and of the point mass. Then, the Hubble tension is naturally explained as a result of two flows, a local and a global one, with non-coinciding Hubble parameters. The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term is shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, Landau damping, and then to aperiodic structures. Aperiodicity thereby emerges as a intrinsic feature of the filamentary and void structure of the local Universe, and reveals the self-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the aperiodicity is then predicted and can be observationally traced upon the increase in the scale of the filaments.</description>

Abstract: We study a cosmological model featuring evolutionary dark energy, according to the idea that the creation of its constituents arises from the gravitational field of the expanding universe, whose non-equilibrium physics is described by a non-zero bulk viscosity coefficient. This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the {\Lambda}CDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the {\Lambda}CDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the {\Lambda}CDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the matter in the universe is in the form of dark matter, that has evaded detection so far. ALPs -- ultralight axionlike particles -- are a class of dark matter candidates that produce measurable signatures in the form of oscillating violations of discrete symmetries in nuclei. We report results from a search for an oscillating parity-odd time-reversal-odd nuclear Schiff moment of $^{153}$Eu ions in a crystal, which leads to constraints on ALP-gluon coupling strength across a wide band spanning eight decades in ALP mass.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of First-Order Electroweak Phase Transitions in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use modern dimensionally-reduced effective field theory methods, with careful attention to scale hierarchies, to analyze and catalog the types of first-order electroweak phase transitions that are possible in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Our calculations lay the necessary groundwork to perform gauge invariant, properly resummed perturbative expansions, and therefore address many of the theoretical problems with phase transition calculations. We find three types of configurations of the scalar potential that allow for a first-order phase transition, namely tree-level barriers, radiative barriers, or radiative symmetry breaking through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. We also find versions of these with significant supercooling. We perform a global likelihood scan over the Wilson coefficients of SMEFT operators involving only the Higgs field, to identify parameter regions that exhibit these first-order phase transitions and are consistent with experimental and theoretical constraints. We comment on the possibilities for electroweak baryogenesis within the SMEFT, and roughly estimate if the gravitational wave spectra generated by the phase transitions are detectable.</description>

Abstract: We present an explicit formulation of cosmological perturbation theory for three-field models with a flat field space. By performing rotations to align one field with the direction of curvature perturbations and applying the same rotations to the other two field directions, we introduce the semikinematic basis, which is applicable to models with more than two fields. We derive the governing equations in this basis. We also stress a characteristic property of more-than-two-field models: the freedom in choosing the isocurvature perturbations. This framework enables the computation of the curvature and two isocurvature power spectra for any given potential. We numerically solve the background and perturbation equations for three distinct scenarios. First, to validate the consistency of our three-field formalism, we examine an effective two-field model inspired by the two-block case of the multigiant vacua matrix inflation scenario. Next, we analyze a purely three-field system without direct interfield interactions. Finally, we study a three-field case that incorporates direct interactions. For all scenarios, we numerically compute the curvature perturbation power spectra and highlight the effects of rapid turns on the spectra. Finally, we investigate the relationship between these quantities and the observables in the early radiation-dominated era. Through both general arguments and a simple example, we show that three-field inflation can yield a much richer phenomenology. This is particularly true when we assume the initial perturbations in the radiation era include two isocurvature modes.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation to equilibrium distributions in cold dark matter halos: origin of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating in the pre-assembled halo develops an $r^{-\gamma}$ inner density cusp, accretion and relaxation in which develops an $r^{-\beta}$ outer fall-off with $\beta \approx 5 - 2\gamma$ in the quasi-steady state. Spherical collapse theory dictates that a quasi-steady outer halo must settle to $\beta \approx 3$, for which the mass enclosed within a shell barely changes with time. This implies that $\gamma\approx 1$, which is possible in the quasilinear framework only if (i) the pre-assembled halo harbors an $r^{-\gamma_{\mathrm{P}}}$ profile with $\gamma_{\mathrm{P}} \gtrsim 0.5$, (ii) its fluctuations are correlated in time (red noise), and (iii) the initial value of $\gamma$ is smaller than $1$, implying that the $r^{-1}$ cusp is a neutral equilibrium. We demonstrate for the first time how the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile emerges as a quasi-steady state of collisionless relaxation.</description>

      <title>Hubble constant measurement from QPEs as electromagnetic counterparts to extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts provide a novel methodology to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens. However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered nuclear transient, quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme/intermediate mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as LISA. Here, we model the secular orbital evolution of known QPE systems using two frameworks: a stripping scenario in which periodic mass transfer at periapsis drives the evolution; and an orbiter-disk collision scenario in which the companion interacts with a misaligned accretion disk, modulated by coupled orbiter-disk precession. For each framework, we assess detectability by LISA, together with the resulting constraints on $H_0$. Our principal findings are: (i) in the stripping scenario, no currently known QPE reaches detectability within a four-year LISA mission. (ii) in the orbiter-disk scenario, two sources-eRO-QPE2 and eRO-QPE4-are detectable with signal-to-noise ratios $\simeq 8.5-28.8$ and constrain $H_0$ with fractional uncertainty of 6.7-14.9\%. QPE systems remain uncertain on the decade-long secular evolution. Therefore, they motivate continued time-domain monitoring of QPE candidates.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the conversion mechanism from scalar field to gravitational waves in magnetic background in $f(R)$ gravity minimal coupled to the Maxwell electrodynamics. Applying the conversion in early universe with primordial magnetic field and the neutron star with strong magnetosphere, the generated gravitational waves, converted from the scalar field, exhibit distinct power spectra which can be potentially probed by future experiments such as DECIGO, BBO, CE and ET.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Reionisation with the Cosmic Star Formation and Active Galactic Nuclei Luminosity History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of the $z=0-13.5$ cosmic star formation history and active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity history as inferred by the James Webb Space Telescope is connected to the cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) to explore the sources of reionisation. We compute the redshift evolution of the corresponding cosmic ionising photon emissivity, the neutral fraction and the cosmic microwave background optical depth. We use the generative SED modelling code ProSpect to bracket the ionising emissivity between escape fractions of $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 1 - 100\%$ for both the stars and AGN. Stars alone could have achieved reionisation by $z\approx 6$ with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} \gtrsim 30\%$ for solar metallicity ($Z=0.02$) stars or $f_{\mathrm{esc}} \gtrsim 10\%$ for metal-poor ($Z=10^{-4}$) stars. On the other hand, AGN by themselves would have struggled to produce sufficiently many ionising photons even with $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 100\%$. A hybrid model containing both stars and AGN is explored where we find best fit (median$\pm 1\sigma$) $f_{\mathrm{esc}}=$ $12\%$ ($14^{+9}_{-7}\%$) for the stars and $f_{\mathrm{esc}}=$ $63\%$ ($60^{+28}_{-32}\%$) for the AGN, maintained at all redshifts. In essence, the joint growth of stellar mass and supermassive black holes produces neither more nor fewer ionising photons than needed to reionise $\gtrsim 99\%$ of the intergalactic medium by $z\approx 6$.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic dark matter in $U(1)_{L_{i}-L_{j}}$ models: a solution to the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess consistent with cosmological and laboratory observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The particle origin of dark matter (DM) remains elusive despite decades of direct, indirect, and collider searches. Several groups have reported a $\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV and a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce the GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that are approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free extensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number, $U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show that these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the observed relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection constraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing. The $L_\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\chi\sim 40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment anomalies, $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection limits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\sim 70-86$ GeV and a DM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and experimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e., approximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also matches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by strong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where $m_\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the few-percent level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Phenomenological study of Quantum-gravity effects is introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.</description>

      <title>Dark-Matter-Deficient Galaxies from Collisions: A New Probe of Bursty Feedback and Dark Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-velocity collisions between gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies present a promising formation channel for dark-matter-deficient galaxies (DMDGs). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the progenitors' baryonic binding energy, $|E_{\rm bind}|$, critically controls the outcome. Repeated potential fluctuations, e.g., from bursty feedback, inject energy and reduce $|E_{\rm bind}|$ by $\approx 15\%$, yielding fewer but substantially more massive DMDGs. By contrast, elastic self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) produces comparable cores without lowering $|E_{\rm bind}|$, resulting in negligible effect. This differs from the other DMDG formation scenario, where SIDM-induced cores enhance dark matter tidal stripping while keeping baryons compact and resilient to tidal effects. The contrasting roles of SIDM help distinguish feedback-formed halo cores from those created by SIDM. Among 15 paired simulation runs, 13 show higher DMDG masses in the weakened-binding case, and about two thirds exhibit $&gt;100\%$ mass enhancements. The simulations also predict systematically lower gas fractions due to sustained post-collision star formation, yielding a clean observational signature. Upcoming wide-field imaging (CSST, LSST), HI surveys (FAST), and kinematic follow-up will be crucial to test this scenario.</description>

      <title>Bound State Perturbations in the Interior of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit our earlier work and investigate the bound state perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The bound sates are defined as the perturbations in the interior of the black hole with an imaginary spectrum which are regular at the center of black hole while their time-dependent profile falls off exponentially on the event horizon. Using the scale factor in the expanding direction in the interior of the black hole as the clock, we rewrite the corresponding Regge-Wheeler equation and solve it semi-analytically as well as numerically. We confirm that the bound state solutions exist for scalar, vector and axial tensor perturbations. It is shown that for a given value of $\ell &gt;s$, there are total $\ell-s$ such bound states. We obtain the universal lower bound $2 G M \omega_I &gt;1$ for the spectrum of bound state which is asymptotically saturated in the large $\ell$ limit. Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound on the spectrum of axial perturbations which for large $\ell$ scales like $2 G M \omega_I \lesssim 0.04\, \ell^4 $. As observed recently, these bound states have the curious property that the profile of the total wave function has a non-zero magnitude near the future event horizon.</description>

      <title>WallGo investigates: Theoretical uncertainties in the bubble wall velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine theoretical uncertainties in state-of-the-art calculations of the bubble wall velocity during first-order cosmological phase transitions. By utilising the software WallGo for two extensions of the Standard Model, we find several $O(1)$ uncertainties arising from the number of particles taken out of equilibrium, the logarithmically and power enhanced collision integrals, the treatment of thermal masses, the nucleation temperature, the $\tanh$ ansatz, and the perturbative order of the effective potential. However, we show that the linearisation of the Boltzmann equations is generally a good approximation with much smaller associated errors. We further clarify the limitations of the quasiparticle approximation in regions with negative mass squared. This study provides a detailed uncertainty budget and highlights where future efforts should be directed to improve the reliability of wall velocity and hence gravitational wave predictions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bound State Perturbations Inside Black Holes and Isospectrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bound state solutions for the polar perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. It is shown that for a given value of the spherical harmonic index $\ell$, there are a total of $\ell-1$ bound states for polar perturbations. We show both analytically and numerically that the spectrum of $\ell-2$ of these perturbations coincides exactly with the spectrum of axial perturbations. Consequently, the isospectrality between the bound states of axial and polar perturbations in the interior of the black hole is preserved. Furthermore, the additional mode found in the spectrum of polar perturbations is the algebraically special mode, which also furnishes the ground state of polar perturbations. It is shown that the spectrum of the highly excited states is equally spaced, which, in the semi-classical approximation, yields the black hole area quantization $\Delta A = 16 \pi l_{\mathrm{Pl}}^2$.</description>

      <title>Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

      <title>Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO): Options for robust Deep Spectral Line Imaging in the SKA-Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The data storage requirements for deep spectral line observations with next-generation radio interferometers like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are extremely challenging. The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\% of the true {\HI} flux. In contrast, our \textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.</description>

      <title>Ghost instabilities and strong coupling in quadratic non-metricity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the framework of Newer General Relativity, defined by all independent quadratic invariants of the non-metricity tensor, including the unique quadratic parity-violating term. We analyze linear perturbations around a flat FLRW background and find that the theory generically exhibits ghost instabilities and/ or propagates more degrees of freedom than in the Minkowski limit, signalling strong coupling. There are two notable exceptions: the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) and the transverse-diffeomorphism-invariant gravity subclass, both of which are supplemented by the parity-violating operator. However, since the parity-violating term explicitly breaks (transverse) diffeomorphism invariance, we show, using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, that the parity-violating extension of STEGR propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>
