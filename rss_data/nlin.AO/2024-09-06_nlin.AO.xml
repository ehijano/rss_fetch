      <title>Gaussian Process Phase Interpolation for estimating the asymptotic phase of a limit cycle oscillator from time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhythmic activity commonly observed in biological systems, occurring from the cellular level to the organismic level, is typically modeled as limit cycle oscillators. The phase reduction theory serves as a useful analytical framework for elucidating the synchronization mechanism of these oscillators. Essentially, this theory describes the dynamics of a multi-dimensional nonlinear oscillator using a single variable phase model. In order to understand and control the rhythmic phenomena in the real world, it is crucial to estimate the asymptotic phase from the observed data. In this study, we propose a new method, Gaussian Process Phase Interpolation (GPPI), for estimating the asymptotic phase from time series data. The GPPI method first evaluates the asymptotic phase on the limit cycle and subsequently estimates the asymptotic phase outside the limit cycle employing Gaussian process regression. Thanks to the high expressive power of Gaussian processes, the GPPI is capable of capturing a variety of functions. Notably, the GPPI is easily applicable even when the dimension of the system increases. The performance of the GPPI is tested by using simulation data from the Stuart-Landau oscillator and the Hodgkin-Huxley oscillator. The results demonstrate that the GPPI can accurately estimate the asymptotic phase even in the presence of high observation noise and strong nonlinearity. Additionally, the GPPI is demonstrated as an effective tool for data-driven phase control of a Hodgkin-Huxley oscillator. Thus, the proposed GPPI will facilitate the data-driven modeling of the limit cycle oscillators.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Limits of Empirical Finance: Causal Reductionism and Self-Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16570v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The clarion call for causal reduction in the study of capital markets is intensifying. However, in self-referencing and open systems such as capital markets, the idea of unidirectional causation (if applicable) may be limiting at best, and unstable or fallacious at worst. In this work, we critically assess the use of scientific deduction and causal inference within the study of empirical finance and financial econometrics. We then demonstrate the idea of competing causal chains using a toy model adapted from ecological predator/prey relationships. From this, we develop the alternative view that the study of empirical finance, and the risks contained therein, may be better appreciated once we admit that our current arsenal of quantitative finance tools may be limited to ex post causal inference under popular assumptions. Where these assumptions are challenged, for example in a recognizable reflexive context, the prescription of unidirectional causation proves deeply problematic.</description>
