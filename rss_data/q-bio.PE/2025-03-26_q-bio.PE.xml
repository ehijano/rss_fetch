      <title>Stem-cell differentiation underpins reproducible morphogenesis</title>

Abstract: Morphogenesis of complex body shapes is reproducible despite the noise inherent in the underlying morphogenetic processes. However, how these morphogenetic processes work together to achieve this reproducibility remains unclear. Here, we ask how morphogenetic reproducibility is realised by developing a computational model that evolves complex morphologies. We find that evolved, complex morphologies are reproducible in a sizeable fraction of simulations, despite no direct selection for reproducibility. Strikingly, reproducible morphologies had also evolved stem-cell systems. We show that reproducibility is caused by a morphogenetic division of labour based on these stem-cell systems, where moving, dividing stem cells ``shape'' morphologies and irreversibly differentiate into stationary, non-dividing cells. These results suggest that stem-cell systems observed in natural development play fundamental roles in morphogenesis in addition to their known role of producing specialised cell types. This previously-unrecognised role of stem-cell systems has major implications for our understanding of how morphologies are generated and regenerated.</description>

      <title>Phylo2Vec: a vector representation for binary trees</title>

Abstract: Binary phylogenetic trees inferred from biological data are central to understanding the shared history among evolutionary units. However, inferring the placement of latent nodes in a tree is computationally expensive. State-of-the-art methods rely on carefully designed heuristics for tree search, using different data structures for easy manipulation (e.g., classes in object-oriented programming languages) and readable representation of trees (e.g., Newick-format strings). Here, we present Phylo2Vec, a parsimonious encoding for phylogenetic trees that serves as a unified approach for both manipulating and representing phylogenetic trees. Phylo2Vec maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to a unique integer vector of length $n-1$. The advantages of Phylo2Vec are fourfold: i) fast tree sampling, (ii) compressed tree representation compared to a Newick string, iii) quick and unambiguous verification if two binary trees are identical topologically, and iv) systematic ability to traverse tree space in very large or small jumps. As a proof of concept, we use Phylo2Vec for maximum likelihood inference on five real-world datasets and show that a simple hill-climbing-based optimisation scheme can efficiently traverse the vastness of tree space from a random to an optimal tree.</description>

      <title>Tractable fish growth models considering individual differences with an application to the fish Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling fish growth is an important research topic in ecological and fishery sciences because body weight statistics directly affect the total biomass of fish in a habitat, which in turn affects their population dynamics. Many models of fish growth assume that the fish population in a habitat is homogenous, meaning that there is no physiological spectrum and, therefore, no size spectrum. Moreover, models that account for the size spectrum are not always analytically tractable. We present novel mathematical models of fish growth in which the body weight of each fish is assumed to follow a von Bertalanffy-type model whose proportionality coefficient, representing the maximum body weight, may differ among individual fish. This probabilistic description introduces the size spectrum into the model, owing to which the time-dependent probability density of this model is obtained explicitly. We also consider a misspecified version and a stochastic version of the model as advanced cases. We apply the first model to the real growth data of Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis as a keystone fish species in Japan. The model successfully reproduces the skewed size spectrum of this fish species over multiple years. We further use the stochastic model to investigate how fish growth dynamics are affected by environmental fluctuations.</description>
