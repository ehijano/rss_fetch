      <title>Crystal Fields and Zeeman Effect for Thulium in Solid Argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active defects suspended in an inert solid are an interesting system for sensing and magnetometry at the nanometer scale, in addition to being a potential source of high-density, identical quantum emitters for quantum information. Beyond their response to external fields, the optical absorption and emission spectra also reflect information about the host matrix, which is critical to understand for either application. For the particular system of thulium atoms implanted in solid argon, high resolution laser spectroscopy reveals narrow ensemble linewidths of the 1140 nm f to f ground state spin-orbit transition, which is split due to crystal field effects and hyperfine coupling. Pump-probe spectroscopy is used to identify crystal field levels in at least two stable trapping sites, and the crystal field is determined to be nearly axial in both sites. Strong selection rules indicate that this transition becomes magnetic-electric in the argon host, most likely due to dielectric effects. In the presence of mT magnetic fields, Zeeman shifts are resolvable by laser fluorescence, allowing crystal axis selective polarized spectroscopy. These results show that all-optical detection schemes for DC magnetic fields are already possible with thulium-doped argon, and point towards more informed strategies for monitoring and improving crystal growth and annealing.</description>

      <title>Observation of the electric Breit-Rabi Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of an atom to external electric and magnetic fields can reveal fundamental atomic properties. It has long been verified that, in a static magnetic field, those atomic energy levels with hyperfine interactions shift according to the Breit-Rabi formula, which introduces nonlinear dependence on the magnetic field. On the other hand, the corresponding Breit-Rabi dependence on a static electric field has not been observed before due to a combination of experimental challenges. Here we precisely measure the Stark shift of the $6s^2\ ^1S_0\ \leftrightarrow\ 6s6p\ ^1P_1$ transition of $^{171}$Yb ($I$ = 1/2) with cold atoms held by an optical dipole trap in a static electric field up to 120 kV/cm. We observe the electric Breit-Rabi effect displaying high-order ($E^4$ and $E^6$) DC Stark shifts. These effects arise from the influence of the strong electric field on hyperfine interactions.</description>

      <title>Electric field measurements of Rydberg atomic frequency comb based on pulsed laser excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an innovative frequency comb methodology utilizing pulsed lasers for Rydberg atoms and implement it for electric field measurement. It achieves the Rydberg state population of multi-velocity group atoms through the two-photon resonant excitation of a 509 nm pulsed laser and an 852 nm continuous laser. The frequency comb approach markedly elevates the population of Rydberg atoms and augments the atomic density for sensing, thereby enhancing measurement sensitivity. Our investigations generated high-sensitivity measurements of electric fields across a broad spectrum from 20 kHz to 96 MHz, with a minimum measured electric field sensitivity of 2.9uV/cm/Hz(1/2). Additionally, we have exhibited a high degree of measurement sensitivity in the 66 MHz and 88 MHz broadcast communication frequencies. This research enhances the effective detection of microwave signals over a broad spectrum of frequency bands utilizing Rydberg atoms and introduces an innovative technical methodology for microwave metrology grounded in Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Ionization Energy of Rb$_2$ by electric field-ionization of molecular Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the measurement of the ionization energy of the $^{85}\text{Rb}_2$ molecule through resonantly enhanced 2-photon ionization in a supersonic beam. The first photon excites the $X^1\Sigma_g^+ (v_X = 0)\rightarrow B^1\Pi_u (v_B = 2)$ transition, while the second photon wavenumber is scanned over the 16720 cm$^{-1}$-16750 cm$^{-1}$ range, thus yielding a structured spectrum of Rb$_2^+$ ions extracted by an electric field and recorded by mass spectrometry. We modeled the onset of the ionization signal as a function of the electric field strength between $18 V/cm$ and $180 V/cm$, leading to the Rb$_2$ ionization energy $E_i = 31497.3 \pm 0.6 $cm$^{-1}$, and to the dissociation energy of the Rb$_2^+$ ground state $D_0 = 6158.2 \pm 0.6$ cm$^{-1}$. Our measured value $E_i$ is found to be $149.3$ cm$^{-1}$ larger than the one reported in the experiment by Bellos et al. [Phys. Rev. A 87, 012508 (2013)]. Our value of $D_0$ agrees with our theoretical determination using a quantum chemistry approach. Using a simple theoretical model, we assign unevenly spaced structures of the ionization spectrum to molecular Rydberg levels belonging to several series that converge to the lowest vibrational levels of Rb$_2^+$.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optical double-resonance vector magnetometry with warm Rb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a non-invasive, accurate vector magnetometer that operates at ambient temperature and is conducive to miniaturization and is self-calibrating is a significant challenge. Here, we present an unshielded three-axis vector magnetometer whose operation is based on the angle-dependent relative amplitude of magneto-optical double-resonance features in a room-temperature atomic ensemble. Magnetic-field-dependent double resonance features change the transmission of an optical probe tuned to the D2 optical transition of $^{87}$Rb in the presence of a microwave field driving population between the Zeeman sublevels of the ground state hyperfine levels $F = 1$ and $F = 2$. Sweeping the microwave frequency over all Zeeman sublevels results in seven double-resonance features, whose amplitudes vary as the orientation of the external static magnetic field changes with respect to the optical and microwave field polarization directions. Using a convolutional neural network model, the magnetic field direction is measured in this proof-of-concept experiment with an accuracy of 1{\deg} and its amplitude near 50 $\mu$T with an accuracy of 115 nT.</description>

      <title>Reversing adiabatic state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of an adiabatic state preparation in an effective three-level quantum system. States can be prepared with high speed and fidelity by adding a counterdiabatic quantum control protocol. As a second step, we invert the preparation protocol to get back to the initial state. This describes an overall cyclic evolution in state space. Using counterdiabatic terms, the resulting composed fast evolution can be repeated many times. We then analyze the control of Berry's phase along the adiabatic cyclic path, and show that Berry's phase can act as a sensitive detector of non-perfect state transfer.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Structure and Helicity Anomaly in Relativistic Electron Vortex Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relativistic electron vortex beam (REVB) has attracted increasing attention due to its nontrivial spin-orbit structure recently. As relativistic electrons are governed by the Dirac equation, exact solutions to this equation provide the most reliable starting point for understanding angular momentum characteristics of REVBs. In this work, a set of exact eigensolutions of the Dirac equation are derived in a complex cylindrical coordinate system using a generalized series expansion method. We demonstrate that the eigenstate carries net angular momentum with the vortex charge being the quantum number of the total angular momentum along the propagation direction and deduce the explicit expression for the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Furthermore, we show that helicity, which exhibits anomaly in the vortex state, can serve as a practical characterizing quantity for the REVB. This work lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration of REVBs in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms exhibit remarkable sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, making them promising candidates for revolutionizing field sensors. Unlike conventional antennas, they neither disturb the measured field nor necessitate intricate calibration procedures. In this study, we propose a protocol for signal reception near the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, harnessing the capabilities of warm Rydberg atoms. Our focus lies on exploring various quadrature amplitude modulations and transmission frequencies through heterodyne detection. We offer a comprehensive characterization of our setup, encompassing the atomic response frequency range and attainable electric field amplitudes. Additionally, we delve into analyzing communication errors using Voronoi diagrams, along with evaluating the communication channel capacity across different modulation schemes. Our findings not only lay the groundwork for future wireless communication applications, but also present opportunities to refine protocols in classical communication and field sensing domains.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine anomaly in mercury and test of the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Moskowitz-Lombardi rule gives a simple relation between the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus and the effect of its radial distribution on the hyperfine structure - the magnetic hyperfine anomaly or "Bohr-Weisskopf" effect. It was originally formulated for mercury, for which experimental data for nuclear magnetic moments and hyperfine constants were available for a number of isotopes. While the relation for the differential effect between isotopes may be completely determined experimentally, the value for the additive constant that is needed to give the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect for a single isotope has remained untested. In this work, we determine the BW effect in singly-ionized and neutral mercury from experimental muonic Hg-199 data together with our atomic calculations. We check this result by directly extracting the BW effect from the hyperfine constant for singly-ionized Hg-199 using state-of-the-art atomic many-body calculations. From this we deduce an empirical value for the additive constant in the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule, which differs significantly from the values advocated previously.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Properties of Light Diatomic Molecules in Strong Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we develop and implement a specialized coupled-cluster (CC) approach tailored for accurately describing atoms and molecules in strong magnetic fields. Using the open-source Ghent Quantum Chemistry Package (\texttt{GQCP}) in conjunction with the Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework (\texttt{PySCF}), we calculate potential energy curves, permanent and transient dipole moments, as well as vibrational spectra for the diatomic molecules H$_2$, HeH$^+$ and LiH under various magnetic field strengths adopting a fully non-perturbative treatment. The main computational difficulties stem from the inclusion of the magnetic field in the Hamiltonian, in particular, from the presence of the angular momentum operator, which leads to a complication of the wave function and introduces a gauge-origin dependence. Addressing these challenges requires advanced modifications to existing routines, which we achieve by implementing gauge-comprising atomic orbitals (GIAOs) by using \texttt{GQCP}, and the capabilities offered by \texttt{PySCF}. This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of the CC theory, opening pathways for more comprehensive investigations in molecular quantum chemistry at strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dress-State Engineered Rydberg Electrometry: Achieving 100-MHz-level Instantaneous-Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10541v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms, with their giant electric dipole moments and tunable energy-level transitions, offer exceptional potential for microwave (MW) electric field sensing, combining high sensitivity and broad frequency coverage. However, simultaneously achieving high sensitivity and wide instantaneous bandwidth in a Rydberg-based MW transducer remains a critical challenge. Here, we propose a multi-dress-state engineered superheterodyne detection scheme for Rydberg electrometry that exploits a detuning-dependent dual-peak response structure and a Rabi-frequency-driven dip-lifting effect to overcome the limitation on instantaneous bandwidth. By strategically engineering the multiple dress states of Rydberg atoms, we demonstrate a thermal $\mathrm{^{87}Rb}$ vapor-based transducer with a record sensitivity of $\mathrm{140.4\,nV\,cm^{-1}\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ and an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 54.6$\,$MHz. The performance metrics are now approaching the practical requirements of modern MW receivers (100-MHz-level) in certain application fields. This advancement bridges the gap between atomic sensing and real-world applications, paving the way for Rydberg-atom technologies in radar,wireless communication, and spectrum monitoring.</description>

      <title>Interference of photons from independent hot atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherence of light from independent ensembles of elementary atomic emitters plays a paramount role in diverse areas of modern optics. We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. It relies on the feasibility of the preservation of coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. The presented interferometry represents a sensitive and robust methodology for Doppler-free optical atomic and molecular spectroscopy based on photon correlation measurements on scattered light.</description>

      <title>Superheterodyne Rydberg S-band receiver with a multi-tone local oscillator based on an atomic transition loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-vapor sensors based on Rydberg atoms now face a transition towards practical applications, with several outstanding challenges. To achieve the best sensitivities, a superheterodyne mode of operation is desired, which requires the presence of a local oscillator in the vapor cell. This local oscillator hinders several advantages of the sensor, such as stealthy and all-optical operation. We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor. Our sensor operates at the S-band frequency, known for its usage in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, without interfering with the signal itself.</description>
