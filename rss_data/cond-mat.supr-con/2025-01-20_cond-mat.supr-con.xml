      <title>Optical probes of two-component pairing states in transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures based on 2H-NbSe$_2$ and 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ have recently displayed surprising signatures of unconventional superconductivity. While the pairing channel remains unknown, it has been argued that spin fluctuations should lead to a two-component $E'$ pairing state which is compatible with some experimental features. Exploiting the particular multi-orbital character of the Fermi surface and the presence of Ising spin-orbit coupling which enable finite optical conductivity in the clean limit, in this work we predict clear-cut optical signatures of the chiral and nematic ground states of the $E'$ pairing. In particular, we show how the spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and threefold symmetry are reflected in the optical Hall and anisotropic conductivities, respectively, while different spectral features can be connected with the momentum dependence of the gap functions. Our work provides a fingerprint that can be measured experimentally, constraining the pairing channel in TMD superconductors, and will help determine whether superconductivity is topological in these systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Hubbard pairing in a cuprate ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubbard model is believed to capture the essential physics of cuprate superconductors. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that it fails to reproduce a robust and homogeneous superconducting ground state. Here, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that magnetic excitations in the prototypical cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ are inconsistent with those of a simple Hubbard model. The magnetic response of hole carriers, contributing to an emergent branch of spin excitations, is strongly suppressed. This effect is the consequence of d-wave-like pairing, enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude through a large nearest-neighbor attractive interaction. The similarity between cuprate ladders and the two-dimensional compounds suggests that such an enhanced hole pairing may be a universal feature of superconducting cuprates.</description>

      <title>Cooper-Pair Localization in the Magnetic Dynamics of a Cuprate Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spin dynamics of the cuprate ladder Sr$_{2.5}$Ca$_{11.5}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ to elucidate the behavior of its intrinsically doped holes. Combining high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and density matrix renormalization group calculations enables a comprehensive analysis of the collective magnetic dynamics. We find a general absence of magnetic signatures from unpaired charges, indicating holes within the system form strongly bound localized Cooper pairs. A one-band Hubbard model fails to match the spectral features but a straightforward extension to a large attractive nearest-neighbor interaction quantitatively explains our results. Our finding shows the significance of additional interactions beyond the long-predicted quantum spin pairing in the ($d$-wave) charge pairing process. Considering the parallels between ladders and two-dimensional cuprates, these results are potentially relevant for square lattices as well.</description>

      <title>p-wave superconductivity induced by nearest-neighbor attraction in the square-lattice extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model is widely believed to contain the key ingredients of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials. Here, we report a constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) study of the square-lattice extended Hubbard model with on-site Coulomb repulsion U and nearest-neighbor (NN) electron attraction V. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.125, we find that the NN electron attraction V can notably drive an exotic spin-triplet (p-wave) superconducting (SC) phase, and enhance the p-wave SC correlations with the increase of V. But in the intermediate coupling regime, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (d-wave) does not significantly increase with the increase of V, indicating that the d-wave is not affected by V in strongly correlated system. Besides the pairing phase, a spin density wave (SDW) only exists near the half-filling in the particle-hole channel, and doping disrupts the formation of SDW order. Especially, the NN electron attraction V has no significant effect on SDW, reflecting the consistent relationship between d-wave SC and spin correlation. Moreover, as doping increases, the dominant region of p-wave also expands, further suppressing the presence of d-wave, which may help explain the disappearance of d-wave SC in overdoped cuprate superconductors. We also find the d-wave exhibits a singular nonzero (near point ($2{\pi}/3, {\pi}$)) condensation structure in momentum space, resulting in a different staggered behavior in the x and y direction with distance in real space. On the contrary, the p-wave condensed at zero momentum, and the p-wave correlation exhibits exponential decay in real space. Our work suggests the p-wave SC region can be induced and further broadened by the NN electron attraction V, offering a feasible mechanism to realize p-wave superconductivity in realistic cuprate materials.</description>

      <title>Quantized current steps due to the synchronization of microwaves with Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization of Bloch oscillations in small Josephson junctions (JJs) under microwave radiation, which leads to current quantization, has been proposed as an effect that is dual to the appearance of Shapiro steps. This current quantization was recently demonstrated in superconducting nanowires in a compact high-impedance environment. Direct observation of current quantization in JJs would cofirm the synchronization of Bloch oscillations with microwaves and help with the realisation of the metrological current standard. Here, we place JJs in a high-impedance environment and demonstrate dual Shapiro steps for frequencies up to 24 GHz (I=7.7 nA). Current quantization exists, however, only in a narrow range of JJ parameters. We carry out a systematic study to explain this by invoking the model of a JJ in the presence of thermal noise. The findings are important for fundamental physics and application in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Critical Filaments and Superconductivity in Quasiperiodic Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer moir\'e materials can exhibit topological electronic features yet are inherently quasiperiodic -- leading to wave function interference whose Anderson-localizing tendency can be mitigated by topology. We consider a quasiperiodic variant of the chiral Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene with two incommensurate moir\'e potentials that serves as a toy model for twisted trilayer. We observe "filaments" linking magic angles with enhanced density of states and fractal wave functions that evade localization; states away from the filaments mimic fractal surface states of dirty topological superconductors. We demonstrate that topological quasiperiodicity can broadly enhance superconductivity without magic-angle fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>The fate of poor man's Majoranas in the long Kitaev chain limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A minimal Kitaev chain, consisting of two quantum dots connected via a superconductor, can host highly localized near-zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). These states have been proposed as promising candidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup. However, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are actually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we study PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit, not all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some PMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there is no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve into true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid transport and strong mass enhancement near the nematic quantum critical point in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity is often accompanied by non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior, which emerges near a quantum critical point (QCP) - a point where an electronic ordered phase is terminated at absolute zero under non-thermal parameters. While nematic orders, characterized by broken rotational symmetry, are sometimes found in unconventional superconductors, the role of nematic fluctuations in driving NFL transport behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigated electrical and thermoelectric transport properties in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films and observed hallmark NFL behavior: temperature-linear resistivity and logarithmic divergence of thermoelectricity at low temperatures. Notably, the thermoelectricity peaks sharply at the nematic QCP ($x$ = 0.45), highlighting the dominant role of nematic fluctuations in the NFL transport. Furthermore, we found that the pair-breaking mechanisms in the superconducting phase crosses over from orbital- to Pauli-limited effects, indicating the mass enhancement near the nematic critical regime. These findings reveal the profound impact of nematic fluctuations on both normal-state transport and superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Interplay of orbital-selective Mott criticality and flat-band physics in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Correlated electronic structures and unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates opens new possibilities for investigating electronic structures in this new class of high-transition temperature $T_C$ superconductors. Here, we construct a realistic multi-orbital Hubbard model for the thin-film system, by integrating ab initio calculations with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements, which reveal a higher-symmetry lattice. The interaction parameters are calculated with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Density functional theory (DFT) plus cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) calculations, with cRPA calculated on-site Coulomb repulsive $U$ and experimentally measured electron filling $n$, quantitatively reproduces Fermi surfaces from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. The distinct Fermi surface topology from simple DFT+$U$ results features the indispensable role of correlation effects. Based upon the correlated electronic structures, A modified random-phase-approximation (RPA) approach yields a pronounced $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing instability, due to the strong spin fluctuations originated from Fermi surface nesting between bands with predominantly $d_{z^{2}}$ characters. Our findings highlight the quantitative effectiveness of the DFT+cRPA+CDMFT approach that precisely determines correlated electronic structure parameters without fine-tuning. The revealed intermediate correlation effect may explain the same order-of-magnitude onset $T_C$ observed both in pressured bulk and strained thin film bilayer nickelates.</description>
