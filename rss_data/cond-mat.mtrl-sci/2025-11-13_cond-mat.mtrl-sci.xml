      <title>Polaron and Strain Effects on Ion Migration in WO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion migration in WO$_3$ is a critical process for various technological applications, such as in batteries, electrochromic devices and energy-efficient brain-inspired computing devices. In this study, we investigate the migration mechanisms of H$^+$, Li$^+$, and Mg$^{2+}$ ions in monoclinic WO$_3$, and how energy barriers are affected by the presence of electron polarons and by lattice strain. Our approach in calculating the migration paths and barriers is based on density functional theory methods. The results show that the presence of polarons leads to association effects and lattice deformations that increase ion migration barriers. Therefore, the consideration of polarons is critical to accurately predict activation energies of ion migration. We further show that lattice strain modulates ion migration barriers, however, the impact of strain depends on the migrating ion. For protons that are embedded in the oxygen ion electronic shells and hop from donor to acceptor oxygens, compressive lattice strain accelerates migration by reducing the donor-acceptor distance. In contrast, the migration barriers of larger ions decrease with tensile lattice strain that increases the free space for the ion in the transition state. These insights into the effects of polarons and lattice strain are important for understanding and tuning properties of WO$_3$ when aiming for optimized device characteristics.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Composition and Band Gap in $\kappa$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Heterostructures via STEM-EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution mapping of electronic properties at oxide heterointerfaces remains challenging due to probe delocalization and overlapping signals. In this work, we employ monochromated, probe-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) to resolve band gap variations across $\kappa$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based multilayers with nanometer-scale precision. A custom automated quantitative-based EELS analysis framework enabled automated band gap fitting and visualization, ensuring reproducibility and high spatial resolution. By optimizing acquisition parameters and quantifying inelastic delocalization, we demonstrate reliable extraction of band gap excitations from layers only a few nanometers thick. For heterostructures grown on ITO templates, strain at defect-free interfaces induces a gradual band gap transition from $5.08~\mathrm{eV}$ to $4.28~\mathrm{eV}$ over $\sim 10~\mathrm{nm}$, despite an abrupt compositional change. In contrast, ZnO-based templates introduce structural defects that relieve strain, yielding band gaps consistent with composition. These results establish STEM-EELS as a powerful tool for nanoscale electronic characterization and highlight the dominant role of interfacial strain over composition in governing local band structure.</description>

      <title>Average density of Bloch electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field: a second-order response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the average density of a three-dimensional multiband crystal of arbitrary symmetry, metal or insulator, to first and second order in a weak static magnetic field. To linear order and for insulators, the density follows the well-known Streda formula, but for metals there is an extra contribution from the orbital magnetic moments at the Fermi surface. To second order, we find that the average density depends on several microscopic processes. Among these, the quantum metric tensor plays an important role by generating a pseudo-magnetic moment resulting from the rotation of the Bloch wave functions in the complex projective plane. We also discuss the implications of our results for the volume and pressure. The method we develop is explicitly gauge invariant, considers intraband and interband processes on equal footing, accommodates relaxation processes, and can be readily extended to other observables.</description>

      <title>TEM Agent: enhancing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with modern AI tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have had a dramatic effect on capabilities and productivity across many disciplines involving critical thinking and writing. The development of the model context protocol (MCP) provides a way to extend the power of LLMs to a specific set of tasks or scientific equipment with help from curated tools and resources. Here, we describe a framework called TEM Agent designed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that leverages the benefits of LLMs through a MCP approach. We simultaneously access and control several subsystems of the TEM, a data management platform, and high performance computing resources through text-based instructions. We demonstrate the abilities of the TEM Agent to set up and complete intricate workflows using a simplified set of MCP tools and resources accompanying a commercial LLM without any additional training. The use of a framework such as the TEM Agent simplifies access to complex microscope ecosystems comprised of several vendor and custom systems enhancing the ability of users to accomplish microscopy experiments across a range of difficulty levels.</description>

      <title>Mobile chemical cage: Revealing the origin of anomalous lithium diffusion in liquid $Li_{17}Pb_{83}$ alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-temperature performance of liquid $Li_{17}Pb_{83}$, a key fusion reactor material, is governed by its atomic-scale dynamics. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we discover that lithium diffusion is not free but confined within cages formed by lead atoms, a phenomenon we term the chemical cage effect. Structurally, RDF and CSRO analyses confirm a stable local environment where Li is preferentially surrounded by Pb. Dynamically, the MSD and NGP reveal anomalous, heterogeneous lithium diffusion characterized by repeated cage-breaking events. The double-exponential relaxation of the Li-Pb bond probability further distinguishes the escape dynamics of Li from surface and bulk cages. ELF and DOS analyses identify the polar covalent Li-Pb bond as the electronic origin of this cage. This study establishes the chemical bond-directed synergistic cage effect as the core mechanism in $Li_{17}Pb_{83}$, moving beyond traditional geometric constraint models and providing a new paradigm to understand transport in multi-component liquid alloys.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear magnetoresistance and paramagnetic singularity in Hypervalent Bismuthide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials featuring hypervalent bismuth motifs have generated immense interest due to their extraordinary electronic structure and exotic quantum transport. In this study, we synthesized high-quality single crystals of La3ScBi5 characterized by one-dimensional hypervalent bismuth chains and performed a systematic investigation of the magnetoresistive behavior and quantum oscillations. The metallic La3ScBi5 exhibits a low-temperature plateau of electrical resistivity and quasi-linear positive magnetoresistance, with anisotropic magnetoresistive behaviors suggesting the presence of anisotropic Fermi surfaces. This distinctive transport phenomenon is perfectly elucidated by first-principles calculations utilizing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. Furthermore, the nonlinear Hall resistivity pointed towards a multiband electronic structure, characterized by the coexistence of electron and hole carriers, which is further supported by our first-principles calculations. Angle-dependent de Haas-van Alphen oscillations are crucial for further elucidating its Fermiology and topological characteristics. Intriguingly, magnetization measurements unveiled a notable paramagnetic singularity at low fields, which might suggest the nontrivial nature of the surface states. Our findings underscore the interplay between transport phenomena and the unique electronic structure of hypervalent bismuthide La3ScBi5, opening avenues for exploring novel electronic applications.</description>

      <title>MicroEvoEval: A Systematic Evaluation Framework for Image-Based Microstructure Evolution Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.</description>

      <title>AC magnetometry of van der Waals magnets using ultrasensitive Graphene Hall sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the dynamical magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials requires sensitive techniques capable of detecting small magnetic fields from nanoscale samples. We demonstrate quantitative AC and DC magnetometry of a ferromagnetic Fe3-xGeTe2 nanoflakes using ultrasensitive graphene Hall sensors. These devices achieve record-low magnetic field detection noise at both cryogenic and room temperature, enabled by hBN encapsulation, low-resistance fluorographene contacts, and a novel fabrication process. We perform quantitative AC susceptibility measurements up to 1 kHz, resolving both real and imaginary components with nanotesla-scale sensitivity and milliradian phase accuracy, the first such measurement in a van der Waals magnet. Our results establish graphene Hall sensors as a powerful and broadly applicable platform for studying magnetic and superconducting phases near the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>High-speed, High-Resolution, Three-Dimensional Imaging of Threading Dislocations in beta-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ via Phase-Contrast Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a nondestructive, high-resolution method for three-dimensional imaging of threading dislocations in beta-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ (010) using phase-contrast microscopy (PCM). A one-to-one correspondence between dislocation contrasts in PCM images and synchrotron X-ray topography (SR-XRT) images confirms the detection capability of PCM. Compared to SR-XRT, PCM provides enhanced spatial resolution, enabling the distinction of closely spaced dislocations with sub-10-micrometer separation. PCM facilitates direct visualization of dislocation propagation paths along the depth (z) direction by systematically shifting the focal plane into the crystal. In addition, the projection of stacked PCM images enables in-plane (XY) tracing of dislocation lines, providing insight into the preferred slip systems in beta-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$. This work establishes PCM as a versatile and laboratory-accessible technique for three-dimensional, nondestructive characterization of dislocations across entire wide-bandgap semiconductor wafers within a practically acceptable time frame.</description>

      <title>High-throughput, Non-Destructive, Three-Dimensional Imaging of GaN Threading Dislocations with in-Plane Burgers Vector Component via Phase-Contrast Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a nondestructive, high-throughput method for observing dislocations in GaN (0001) using phase-contrast microscopy (PCM). The PCM images (359x300 $\mu$m$^2$) analyzed in this study were acquired with an exposure time of 3 ms per image. The one-to-one correspondence between threading dislocation (TD) contrasts in PCM images and the corresponding contrasts in multiphoton excitation photoluminescence (MPPL) images provides clear evidence that PCM can detect TDs with in-plane Burgers vector components. The contrast shape in PCM reflects the inclination of dislocations with respect to the surface normal: dot contrasts correspond to vertical dislocations, whereas line contrasts correspond to inclined dislocations. By shifting the focal plane from the top surface to the back surface, the three-dimensional propagation paths of dislocations can be visualized. The PCM image obtained represents a projection of threading dislocations within a thickness of approximately 43 $\mu$m. Dislocations spaced as close as 1.3 $\mu$m can be individually resolved. In addition, the capability of PCM to detect scratches, subsurface scratches, facet boundaries, and voids was demonstrated. This study establishes PCM as a versatile and laboratory-accessible technique for three-dimensional, nondestructive characterization of dislocations and other defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new magnesium iron boride Mg4Fe1.1B13.9 in the Mg-Fe-B-N system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new boron-rich ternary phase, Mg4Fe1.1B13.9, was discovered in the Mg-Fe-B-N quaternary system. This novel phase appears in the form of plate-like shaped crystals formed on the surface of Fe-substituted MgB2 during high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) solution growth at 3 GPa and 1960 C. Mg4Fe1.1B13.9 crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with space group Pnam (No. 62) and lattice parameters a = 10.95(2) A, b = 7.07(1) A, and c = 8.72(1) A. Structural refinement reveals a layered architecture composed of alternating layers of Mg-Fe and boron, with boron atoms forming 5-, 6-, and 7-membered ring motifs. A structural comparison indicates that Mg4Fe1.1B13.9 is closely related to the Y2ReB6-type borides. This discovery highlights the effectiveness of the HPHT synthesis in accessing new, complex boron-rich phases. As research in the binary Mg-B system approaches saturation, the identification of Mg4Fe1.1B13.9 offers new insights into the formation of phases in the Mg-Fe-B-N system. This paves the way for the guided synthesis of novel borides with unique properties in other multicomponent systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced spectral range of strain-induced tuning of quantum dots in circular Bragg grating cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable sources of entangled and single photons are essential for implementing entanglement-based quantum information protocols, as quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping depend on photon indistinguishability. Tunable devices are fabricated from indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dots (QDs) embedded in gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanomembranes placed on monolithic piezoelectric substrates. Circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators enhance emission brightness and exploit the Purcell effect; however, the inclusion of CBGs reduces strain-mediated tunability compared to planar nanomembranes. A simple and effective solution is introduced: filling the CBG trenches with a stiff dielectric (aluminum oxide) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) restores up to 95% of the tunability of planar structures. Finite element analysis (FEA) confirms that the tunability loss originates from bending in the device layers due to strain relief in the CBG geometry. Lowering the stiffness of intermediate layers between the QDs and the piezoelectric actuator, such as in bonding or reflector layers, further increases strain losses in uncoated CBGs. Coated devices maintain 98-99% strain-tuning efficiency across all simulated underlayer stiffnesses. The results demonstrate that advantageous optical cavity properties can be effectively combined with piezoelectric strain tuning, enabling scalable, bright, and tunable quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Assessing Band Gap Stability of Organic Semiconductor Thin Films for Flexible Electronic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of organic semiconductors into flexible electronics requires that their optoelectronic properties remain stable under mechanical deformation. Among these, the optical band gap governs exciton generation and limits photovoltaic voltage, making it a key parameter for strain-resilient design. In this work, we investigate band gap shifts in poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT thin films deposited on flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates under uniaxial tensile strain ranging from 1\% to 10\%. Samples were subjected to mechanical deformation and then characterized by ultraviolet--visible (UV--Vis) absorption spectroscopy. The optical band gaps extracted using a standardized Tauc analysis and statistically validated through equivalence testing and robust regression models. We find that up to 7\% strain, the band gap shift ($\Delta E_g$) remains effectively invariant, independent of annealing condition or stack configuration, demonstrating electronic stability. However, at 10\% strain, all groups exhibit a reproducible widening of $\sim$4--5~meV. This threshold-like behavior marks a transition from mechanical accommodation to electronic perturbation. These findings confirm that the optical band gap in semicrystalline P3HT-based thin films is robust under practical deformation, which provides clear strain thresholds to inform mechanical modeling and device-level simulation of flexible organic optoelectronic systems.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the phase transitions occurring during linear heating of the Zr15Nb alloy through a comprehensive, multi-technique methodology comprising in-situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HEXRD), electrical resistance measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal expansion analysis, supplemented by ex-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The findings reveal a complex sequence of phase transformations and corresponding structural changes over a broad temperature range (from room temperature up to 800 ${\deg}$C). Two distinct body-centered cubic (bcc) $\beta$ phases - $\beta_{Zr}$ and $\beta_{Nb}$ - with closely related lattice parameters are identified. At room temperature, the microstructure is characterized by a mixture of the metastable $\beta_{Zr}$ + $\omega_{ath}$ phase. Upon heating, $\beta_{Zr}$ progressively decomposes, giving rise to the formation of $\beta_{Nb}$. TEM observation revealed the cuboidal shape of the $\omega_{iso}$ particles resulting from the high lattice misfit between $\beta$ and $\omega$ phase. The $\omega$ solvus temperature is determined to be approximately 555 ${\deg}$C, as evidenced by in situ HEXRD and abrupt changes in the alloy's thermal and electrical properties. The growth of the $\alpha$ phase occurs after the dissolution of the $\omega$ phase, resulting in a pronounced increase in thermal expansion.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen permeability prediction in palladium alloys and virtual screening of B2-phase stabilized Pd(100-x-y)CuxMy ternary alloys using machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a forward prediction material screening framework designed to discover Pd-Cu alloys with improved B2 phase stability, thereby unlocking simultaneous $H_2$ generation and utilization. First, we trained CatBoost models with literature-derived Pd alloy data to predict $H_2$ permeability from composition and testing conditions. We evaluated fractional, composition-based, and physics-informed descriptors, individually and in combination, and showed that sequential Pearson filtering and fold-wise SHAP-based recursive feature elimination with cross-fold aggregation reduced errors while controlling complexity. Guided by the one-SE rule, a narrower domain-informed set of 13 features provided the best accuracy parsimony trade-off ($R^2=0.81$), only 0.01 below the max. $R^2$ achievable with 3x the number of features. SHAP analysis indicated that high permeability is promoted by elevated temperature, lattice expansion relative to Pd, atomic size mismatch, and favorable mixing tendencies. Second, the selected model was applied to screen $Pd_{(100-x-y)}Cu_{x}M_{y}$ spanning 16 co-dopants M for B2 stabilization. For each M system, we obtained the Pareto set of compositions that minimize Pd content and Miedema heat of formation and maximize the permeability, then picked three compounds, including that with the highest predicted permeability, the lowest Miedema heat of formation, and the lowest Pd content. With a final filter considering M concentration for single-phase Pd-M solution formation, we recommend Pd48.48Cu43.00Y8.52, Pd49.08Cu42.45Sc8.47, Pd56.09Cu33.70La10.21, and Pd52.68Cu40.44Mg6.88 for experimental validation. We predict those alloys to exhibit permeabilities 1.7 to 1.9 higher than B2 Pd60Cu40. Our framework provides plausible experimental targets and a scalable pathway for designing stable, high-temperature, H2-selective Pd-alloy membranes.</description>

      <title>Tunable laser-generated GHz surface acoustic waves during magnetostructural phase transition in FeRh thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-generated surface acoustic waves (SAW) facilitate an efficient information processing in modern spintronics and magnonics. The ability to tune SAW parameters is crucial to achieve an acoustic control over magnonic properties. Such tunability can be achieved in phase-changing magnetic materials accommodating both spin waves and SAWs. A promising material is FeRh alloy, a metallic antiferromagnet at room temperature undergoing a phase transition into ferromagnetic state accompanied by a crystal lattice expansion at 370 K. This transition can also be induced by femtosecond laser pulses. In this paper we use the phase transition in 60 nm Fe49Rh51 film to optically generate pulses of Gigahertz quasi-Rayleigh SAWs. We detect them via photoelastic effect and show that the lattice transformation during phase transition is a dominant strain-generation mechanism for above-threshold excitation. The weight of this contribution rises as the sample is heated closer to AFM-FM transition temperature and 'switches off' when heated above it allowing to control the SAW amplitude. A model based on thermodynamical parameters of Fe49Rh51 shows that the lattice transformation occurring within 95 ps effectively contributes to SAW generation happening at a comparable timescale, while non-equilibrium fast kinetics of the phase transition does not.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Heat Capacity and Phonon Dynamics in Expanded Graphite and EG--MWCNTs Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specific heat of expanded graphite (EG) and EG--multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites (1.0 and 3.0 wt.\% MWCNTs) was measured between 2 and 300~K. The low-temperature heat capacity is dominated by out-of-plane flexural phonons with quadratic dispersion, characteristic of two-dimensional layered systems. Compared with crystalline graphite, EG exhibits enhanced heat capacity due to increased defect density and reduced interlayer coupling. Structural characterization (XRD, Raman, EDS) confirmed variations in stacking order and defect concentration. The data were fitted using a three-term model ($C_{1}T + C_{3}T^{3} + C_{5}T^{5}$), where the negative $C_{5}$ term indicates quadratic phonon dispersion. The results demonstrate the influence of MWCNT integration and structural disorder on phonon dynamics and anisotropic heat capacity in EG-based composites.</description>

      <title>A scalable kinetic Monte Carlo platform enabling comprehensive simulations of charge transport dynamics in polymer-based memristive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer-assisted ion transport underpins both energy storage technologies and emerging neuromorphic computing devices. Efficient modeling of ion migration is essential for understanding the performance of batteries and memristors, but it remains challenging because of the interplay of drift, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions, as well as the limitations of continuum and molecular dynamics approaches. Addressing these challenges is particularly relevant in the context of the climate and energy crisis, where high-performance, low-carbon technologies require optimized ion-conducting materials and devices. Here, we introduce a scalable and flexible stochastic simulation platform that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology to model ion migration in solid-state systems. The platform employs a vectorized, rail-based representation of device geometry, enabling rapid simulation of lateral ion transport and space-charge effects while preserving the stochastic nature of hopping events. It accommodates a wide range of material systems and can integrate experimental input parameters without code modification. We also provide an implementation of the model that takes advantage of highly energy-efficient GPUs, improving the performance and reducing the carbon footprint of the simulations. Validation using polymer-based memristive devices demonstrates the simulator's ability to capture key behaviors, including relaxation decay, current-voltage hysteresis, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and learning/forgetting rates. By balancing computational efficiency with mesoscale physical considerations, the platform provides a versatile tool for exploring ion-driven phenomena in energy storage and neuromorphic devices, supporting exploratory research.</description>

      <title>Role of Wadsley Defects and Cation Disorder to Enhance MoNb12O33 Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wadsley-Roth (WR) niobates have emerged as high-rate anode materials that can combine rapid ionic diffusion with good electronic conductivity. WR compounds have been defect-enhanced by limited annealing, however, such materials often contain multiple types of defects. In particular, both Wadsley defects (variable block size) and transition metal disorder have the potential to modify transport rates, however the corresponding effects are not well understood mechanistically. Here, MoNb12O33 (MNO) was calcined at two different temperatures to compare a defect-rich condition (MNO-800) with a proximal order-rich condition (MNO-900) as assessed through XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and STEM characterizations. Galvanostatically cycled lithium half cells of MNO-800 exhibited additional capacity (307 mAh/g at 0.1C, 4.66% higher) and improved high-rate capacity of 200 mAhg-1 at 10C. ICI-based overpotential analysis identified solid state diffusion as the dominant rate limiting process where MNO-800 correspondingly exhibited ~3X faster capacity-weighted diffusivity. A machine-learning interatomic potential was trained to density functional theory and then applied with molecular dynamics (MLIP-MD) to examine the possible roles of Wadsley defects and transition metal disorder. For both defect-types, Li was found to populate and activate fast diffusion paths from window sites at lower extents of lithiation as compared to the order-rich model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.</description>

      <title>High-Purity Diamond Integration on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ via Microwave Plasma CVD for Enhanced Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of diamond with $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ presents a promising pathway to enhance thermal management in high-power electronic devices, where the inherently low thermal conductivity of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can lead to localized self-heating and elevated junction temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable, low-damage method to integrate high-quality polycrystalline diamond films on (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), enabled by dielectric interlayers and polymer-assisted electrostatic nanodiamond seeding. A systematic investigation of processing conditions was conducted to assess their effects on film morphology, grain evolution, sp3-phase purity, and optical characteristics. Diamond films grown at 800 degC exhibit grain sizes up to 126.6 nm, RMS roughness of 16.3 nm, and a sharp diamond Raman peak at around 1332 cm-1 with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 34.98 cm-1. The corresponding sp$^3$-phase purity exceeds 97.5 percent, with an optical bandgap up to 5.13 eV. Deposition time variation from 10 to 60 minutes at 800 degC results in thicknesses from 53 nm to 315 nm and corresponding grain coarsening. Interlayer comparison reveals that SiO2 yields slightly larger grains and higher purity than SiNx under identical conditions. Notably, films with more than 96 percent sp$^3$ content were achieved at temperatures as low as 480 degC, confirming the compatibility of this approach with reduced thermal budgets. These results provide a robust framework for scalable $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond integration in thermally resilient high power and RF device technologies.</description>

      <title>Material-Based Intelligence: Self-organizing, Autonomous and Adaptive Cognition Embodied in Physical Substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of intelligent materials often draws parallels with the complex adaptive behaviors of biological organisms, where robust functionality stems from sophisticated hierarchical organization and emergent long-distance coordination among a myriad local components. Current synthetic materials, despite integrating advanced sensors and actuators, predominantly demonstrate only simple, pre-programmed stimulus-response functionalities, falling short of robustly autonomous intelligent behavior. These systems typically execute tasks determined by rigid design or external control, fundamentally lacking the intricate internal feedback loops, dynamic adaptation, self-generated learning, and genuine self-determination characteristic of biological agents. This perspective proposes a fundamentally different approach focusing on architectures where material-based intelligence is not pre-designed, but arises spontaneously from self-organization harnessing far-from-equilibrium dynamics. This work explores interdisciplinary concepts from material physics, chemistry, biology, and computation, identifying concrete pathways toward developing materials that not only react, but actively perceive, adapt, learn, self-correct, and potentially self-construct, moving beyond biomimicry to cultivate fully synthetic, self-evolving systems without external control. This framework outlines the fundamental requirements for, and constraints upon, future architectures where complex, goal-directed functionalities emerge synergistically from integrated local processes, distinguishing material-based intelligence from traditional hardware-software divisions. This demands that concepts of high-level goals and robust, replicable memory mechanisms are encoded and enacted through the material's inherent dynamics, inherently blurring the distinction between system output and process.</description>

      <title>Phonon Thermal Hall Effect: The Roles of Disorder, Annealing, and Metallic Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phonon thermal Hall effect (THE) is a ubiquitous yet poorly understood phenomenon in insulators. Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\nabla T_y / \nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios.</description>

      <title>First-principles evidence for conventional superconductivity in a quasicrystal approximant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) host long-range order without translational symmetry, a regime in which the very foundations of BCS theory are not straightforwardly applicable, yet experiments on QCs and their approximant crystals (ACs) point to conventional, $s$-wave, electron-phonon coupled superconductivity. With this work we directly address this seeming contradiction from first principles. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute the superconducting properties of the recently discovered AC Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and quantitatively reproduce its bulk $T_\text{c}$. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first \emph{ab initio} determination of $T_\text{c}$ for an AC and establishes that the electron-phonon framework is predictive in these systems as well. Using the generalized quasichemical approximation for alloy modeling in the decagonal Al-Os family, we predict tunable superconductivity in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Re$_x$ and Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Ir$_x$; in particular, Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ is dynamically stable and estimated to have a $T_\text{c}$ about 30% above Al$_{13}$Os$_4$. Finally, we argue that $T_\text{c}$ obtained for ACs provides practical bounds for the $T_\text{c}$ of their parent QCs, suggesting that the quasicrystalline counterparts of Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ could harbor the highest $T_\text{c}$ among QCs yet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate orbital current induced effects arising from the orbital Hall effect in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers. Thin films of Ti in ohmic contact with Ni were studied using second-harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltage measurements under an applied a.c. current. From these signals, we extract the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). Insertion of a Cu interlayer between the Ni/Ti interface leads to an enhancement of both OHT efficiency and UOMR compared to both Ni/Ti and Ni/Cu bilayers. Furthermore, systematic variation of Ti thickness reveals that both OHT efficiency and UOMR increase with increasing Ti thickness, indicating that the observed phenomena predominantly originate from the bulk orbital Hall effect rather than purely from interfacial mechanisms and Lowering the temperature leads to a clear reduction in both the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). The nearly linear and correlated temperature dependence of both parameters suggests a common underlying mechanism, namely, the orbital Hall effect in the light-metal layer, which governs both the generation of orbital current and its subsequent influence on the ferromagnet through orbital torque and orbital magnetoresistance.</description>

      <title>Deep-lying semi-Dirac fermions in hexagonal close-packed cadmium</title>

Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands anti-crossing at $-3$ eV below the Fermi level in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed cadmium. The linear out-of-plane dispersion is kept up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <title>CrystalFormer-RL: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning played an instrumental role in enhancing the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we employ reinforcement fine-tuning for materials design, in which discriminative machine learning models are used to provide rewards to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer. By optimizing the reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material properties figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning not only enables the property-guided material design but also unlocks property-based material retrieval behavior of pretrained generative model. The present framework opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials design.</description>

      <title>The phase-field model of fracture incorporating Mohr-Coulomb, Mogi-Coulomb, and Hoek-Brown strength surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical phase-field theories of brittle fracture capture toughness-controlled crack growth but do not account for the material's strength surface, which governs fracture nucleation in the absence of cracks. The phase-field formulation of Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a blueprint for incorporating the strength surface while preserving toughness-controlled propagation by introducing a nucleation driving force and presented results for the Drucker-Prager surface. Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025) recently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary strength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a finite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that span diverse mathematical and physical characteristics-the Mohr-Coulomb, 3D Hoek-Brown, and Mogi-Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical fracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture regimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from large pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and toughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad range of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by arbitrary strength surfaces.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Dominated Thermal Transport and Large Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz Law in Topological Semimetal CoSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, relating the electronic thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm e}$) to the electrical conductivity, is vital in numerous applications such as in the design of thermoelectric materials and in the experimental determination of the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). While the WF law is generally robust, violations are frequently observed, typically manifesting in a reduced Lorenz number ($L$) relative to the Sommerfeld value ($L_0$) due to inelastic scattering. Here, we report a pronounced departure from the WF law in the topological semimetal CoSi, where the electronic Lorenz number ($L_{\rm e}$) instead rises up to $\sim40\%$ above $L_0$. We demonstrate that this anomaly arises from strong bipolar diffusive transport, enabled by topological band-induced electron-hole compensation, which allows electrons and holes to flow cooperatively and additively enhance the heat current. Concurrently, we unveil that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity is anomalously large and becomes the dominant component below room temperature. As a result, if $\kappa_{\rm L}$ is assumed negligible -- as conventional in metals, the resulting $L$ from the total thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm tot}=\kappa_{\rm L}+\kappa_{\rm e}$) deviates from $L_0$ by more than a factor of three. Our work provides deeper insight into the unconventional thermal transport physics in topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>P-DRUM: Post-hoc Descriptor-based Residual Uncertainty Modeling for Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual uncertainty modeling (P-DRUM). P-DRUM models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of P-DRUM and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.</description>

      <title>Cavity-induced coherent magnetization and polaritons in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets feature antiparallel spin sublattices with $d$-, $g$-, or $i$-wave spin order, yielding nonrelativistic spin splitting without net magnetization. We show that embedding a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet in a driven optical cavity induces a finite, tunable magnetization. Coherent photon driving couples selectively to electronic sublattices, and the resulting altermagnets' symmetry-broken spin texture yields a pronounced steady-state spin imbalance -- coherent magnetization -- absent in conventional antiferromagnets for the same lattice configuration. A mean-field Lindblad analysis reveals the dominance of quadratic over linear couplings. In the strong-coupling regime, distinct polariton signatures emerge in the steady state of induced magnetization. This work demonstrates cavity control of altermagnets for spintronic applications.</description>
