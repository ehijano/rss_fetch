      <title>Existence Theorem for Cumulative Universe Towers and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds a cumulative tower of Grothendieck universes that provides a precise size discipline for higher type theory. Starting from an increasing sequence of inaccessible cardinals, we give an inductive-recursive definition of universe codes, their decoding functor, and a rank that controls the growth of each code. For every level of the tower we prove closure under dependent products, dependent sums, identity types, and all finite limits and colimits; the colimit part is obtained with a rank-stable quotient constructor. A universe-lifting operation shows strict cumulativity across levels. Assuming propositional resizing at one level, we construct an explicit left adjoint to the inclusion of minus-one truncated types and show that resizing automatically lifts to every higher level. These ingredients combine in an Existence Theorem stating that, over Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the chosen inaccessible cardinals, the tower delivers a sound set-theoretic model of higher type theory. The results supply the size infrastructure required for forthcoming work on Rezk completions and higher topos models.</description>

      <title>A Universe with a $\Delta^1_n$-definable well-order of the reals, $\mathsf{CH}$ and $\Pi^1_n$-Uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper details the construction of a universe where $\Pi^1_3$-uniformization is true, the Continuum Hypothesis holds yet it possesses a $\Delta^1_3$-definable well-order of its reals. The method can be lifted to canonical inner models with finitely many Woodin cardinals to produce universes of $\mathsf{CH}$, $\Pi^1_n$-uniformization and where additionally a $\Delta^1_n$-definable well-order of the reals exist.</description>

      <title>Connected components in d-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given d-minimal expansion $\mathfrak R$ of the ordered real field, we consider the expansion $\mathfrak R^\natural$ of $\mathfrak R$ generated by the sets of the form $\bigcup_{S \in \mathcal C}S$, where $\mathcal C$ is a subfamily of the collection of connected components of an $\mathfrak R$-definable set. We prove that $\mathfrak R^{\natural}$ is d-minimal. A similar assertion holds for almost o-minimal expansions of ordered groups.</description>

      <title>On the Consistency of Peano Arithmetic in a Proof-theoretic Semantics for Classical Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a proof of the consistency of Peano Arithmetic (PA) within a novel semantic framework for classical logic due to Sandqvist. The argument proceeds by constructing an object $\mathfrak{A}$ -- the arithmetic base -- which supports all axioms of PA and can be shown to not support $\bot$, relative to a well-foundedness assumption equivalent to $\epsilon_0$-induction. This framework belongs to the paradigm of proof-theoretic semantics, that unlike model-theoretic approaches, offers a finitistically acceptable account in the spirit of Hilbert's Programme.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical formula classes with respect to semi-classical prenex normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [10], the authors formalized the standard transformation procedure for prenex normalization of first-order formulas and showed that the classes $\mathrm{E}_k$ and $\mathrm{U}_k$ introduced in Akama et al. [1] are exactly the classes induced by $\Sigma_k$ and $\Pi_k$ respectively via the transformation procedure. In that sense, the classes $\mathrm{E}_k$ and $\mathrm{U}_k$ correspond to $\Sigma_k$ and $\Pi_k$ based on classical logic respectively. On the other hand, some transformations of the prenex normalization are not possible in constructive theories. In this paper, we introduce new classes $\mathcal{E}_k^n$ and $\mathcal{U}_k^n$ of first-order formulas with two parameters $k$ and $n$, and show that they are exactly the classes induced by $\Sigma_k$ and $\Pi_k$ respectively according to the $n$-th level semi-classical prenex normalization, which is obtained by the prenex normalization in [10] with some restriction to the introduced classes of degree $n$. In particular, the latter corresponds to possible transformations in intuitionistic arithmetic augmented with the law-of-excluded-middle schema restricted to formulas of $\Sigma_n$-form. In fact, if $ n\geq k$, our classes $\mathcal{E}_k^n$ and $\mathcal{U}_k^n$ are identical with the cumulative variants $\mathrm{E}^+_k$ and $\mathrm{U}^+_k$ of $\mathrm{E}_k$ and $\mathrm{U}_k$ respectively. In this sense, our classes are refinements of $\mathrm{E}^+_k$ and $\mathrm{U}^+_k$ with respect to the prenex normalization from the semi-classical perspective.</description>

      <title>The exact strength of generic absoluteness for the universally Baire sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of reals is \textit{universally Baire} if all of its continuous preimages in topological spaces have the Baire property. $\sf{Sealing}$ is a type of generic absoluteness condition introduced by Woodin that asserts in strong terms that the theory of the universally Baire sets cannot be changed by forcing.
  The $\sf{Largest\ Suslin\ Axiom}$ ($\sf{LSA}$) is a determinacy axiom isolated by Woodin. It asserts that the largest Suslin cardinal is inaccessible for ordinal definable bijections. Let $\sf{LSA-over-uB}$ be the statement that in all (set) generic extensions there is a model of $\sf{LSA}$ whose Suslin, co-Suslin sets are the universally Baire sets.
  We show that over some mild large cardinal theory, $\sf{Sealing}$ is equiconsistent with $\sf{LSA-over-uB}$. In fact, we isolate an exact large cardinal theory that is equiconsistent with both (see \rdef{dfn:hod_pm}). As a consequence, we obtain that $\sf{Sealing}$ is weaker than the theory $``\sf{ZFC} + $there is a Woodin cardinal which is a limit of Woodin cardinals".
  A variation of $\sf{Sealing}$, called $\sf{Tower \ Sealing}$, is also shown to be equiconsistent with $\sf{Sealing}$ over the same large cardinal theory.
  The result is proven via Woodin's $\sf{Core\ Model\ Induction}$ technique, and is essentially the ultimate equiconsistency that can be proven via the current interpretation of $\sf{CMI}$ as explained in the paper.</description>

      <title>Q-points, selective ultrafilters, and idempotents, with an application to choiceless set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ultrafilters from the perspective of the algebra in the \v{C}ech-Stone compactification of the natural numbers, and idempotent elements therein. The first two results that we prove establish that, if $p$ is a Q-point (resp. a selective ultrafilter) and $\mathscr F^p$ (resp. $\mathscr G^p$) is the smallest family containing $p$ and closed under iterated sums (resp. closed under Blass--Frol\'{\i}k sums and Rudin--Keisler images), then $\mathscr F^p$ (resp. $\mathscr G^p$) contains no idempotent elements. The second of these results about a selective ultrafilter has the following interesting consequence: assuming a conjecture of Blass, in models of the form $\mathbf{L}(\mathbb R)[p]$ where $\mathbf{L}(\mathbb R)$ is a Solovay model (of $\mathsf{ZF}$ without choice) and $p$ is a selective ultrafilter, there are no idempotent elements. In particular, the theory $\mathsf{ZF}$ plus the existence of a nonprincipal ultrafilter on $\omega$ does not imply the existence of idempotent ultrafilters, which answers a question of DiNasso and Tachtsis (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146, 397-411). Following the line of obtaining independence results in $\mathsf{ZF}$, we finish the paper by proving that $\mathsf{ZF}$ plus "every additive filter can be extended to an idempotent ultrafilter" does not imply the Ultrafilter Theorem over $\mathbb R$, answering another question of DiNasso and Tachtsis from the same paper.</description>

      <title>The Mostowski Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1950, Novak and Mostowski showed that GB (G\"odel-Bernays theory of classes) is conservative over ZF, and therefore by G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem the consistency of ZF is unprovable in GB. In the same year Mostowski unveiled a contrasting result: GB provides a truth-definition for ZF-formulae. Here we first give an expository account of Mostowski's construction and surrounding results, and then we show that the construction bridges the domain of Tarski-style truth theories over PA with certain subsystems of second order arithmetic.</description>

      <title>A Strongly Non-Saturated Aronszajn Tree Without Weak Kurepa Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the negation of Chang's conjecture, there is a c.c.c. forcing which adds a strongly non-saturated Aronszajn tree. Using a Mahlo cardinal, we construct a model in which there exists a strongly non-saturated Aronszajn tree and the negation of the Kurepa hypothesis is c.c.c. indestructible. For any inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$, there exists a forcing poset which is Y-proper and $\kappa$-c.c., collapses $\kappa$ to become $\omega_2$, and adds a strongly non-saturated Aronszajn tree. The quotients of this forcing in intermediate extensions are indestructibly Y-proper on a stationary set with respect to any Y-proper forcing extension. As a consequence, we prove from an inaccessible cardinal that the existence of a strongly non-saturated Aronszajn tree is consistent with the non-existence of a weak Kurepa tree. Finally, we prove from a supercompact cardinal that the existence of a strongly non-saturated Aronszajn tree is consistent with two-cardinal tree properties such as the indestructible guessing model principle.</description>
