      <title>Poisson Log-Normal Process for Count Data Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling count data is important in physics and other scientific disciplines, where measurements often involve discrete, non-negative quantities such as photon or neutrino detection events. Traditional parametric approaches can be trained to generate integer-count predictions but may struggle with capturing complex, non-linear dependencies often observed in the data. Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a robust non-parametric alternative to modeling continuous data; however, it cannot generate integer outputs. We propose the Poisson Log-Normal (PoLoN) process, a framework that employs GP to model Poisson log-rates. As in GP regression, our approach relies on the correlations between data points captured via GP kernel structure rather than explicit functional parameterizations. We demonstrate that the PoLoN predictive distribution is Poisson-LogNormal and provide an algorithm for optimizing kernel hyperparameters. Furthermore, we adapt the PoLoN approach to the problem of detecting weak localized signals superimposed on a smoothly varying background - a task of considerable interest in many areas of science and engineering. Our framework allows us to predict the strength, location and width of the detected signals. We evaluate PoLoN's performance using both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the open dataset from CERN which was used to detect the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. Our results indicate that the PoLoN process can be used as a non-parametric alternative for analyzing, predicting, and extracting signals from integer-valued data.</description>

      <title>Almanac: MCMC-based signal extraction of power spectra and maps on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16134v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference in cosmology often starts with noisy observations of random fields on the celestial sphere, such as maps of the microwave background radiation, continuous maps of cosmic structure in different wavelengths, or maps of point tracers of the cosmological fields. Almanac uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling to infer the underlying all-sky noiseless maps of cosmic structures, in multiple redshift bins, together with their auto- and cross-power spectra. It can sample many millions of parameters, handling the highly variable signal-to-noise of typical cosmological signals, and it provides science-ready posterior data products. In the case of spin-weight 2 fields, Almanac infers $E$- and $B$-mode power spectra and parity-violating $EB$ power, and, by sampling the full posteriors rather than point estimates, it avoids the problem of $EB$-leakage. For theories with no $B$-mode signal, inferred non-zero $B$-mode power may be a useful diagnostic of systematic errors or an indication of new physics. Almanac's aim is to characterise the statistical properties of the maps, with outputs that are completely independent of the cosmological model, beyond an assumption of statistical isotropy. Inference of parameters of any particular cosmological model follows in a separate analysis stage. We demonstrate our signal extraction on a CMB-like experiment.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Bias Profile of Cosmic Voids:A Comparison of Void Finders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic voids, the largest underdense regions in the Universe, provide unique laboratories for studying galaxy formation and constitute powerful probes of cosmology. Recent work has shown that individual galaxy bias (b_i), which quantifies how each galaxy traces the underlying dark matter field, exhibits a characteristic radial dependence within spherical voids, defining a void bias profile in which galaxies near void centers display systematically lower bias values. We investigate how the environmental modulation of individual galaxy bias depends on the adopted void-finding algorithm by comparing measurements across five distinct void definitions: spherical voids 'sparkling', watershed-based methods ('zobov' and 'revolver' in two modes), and free-form integrated-density voids ('popcorn'). We apply these complementary void-finding algorithms to the same galaxy sample drawn from the IllustrisTNG simulation (TNG300-1 at $z=0$) and compute individual galaxy bias profiles as a function of distance from void centers. We quantify the correlation between b_i and the membership of the void catalogs and explore how this relationship varies with the integrated underdensity threshold for density-based methods. We find that the radial gradient of individual bias within voids, generally increasing from negative values at the void centers to higher values at the boundaries, is robust across most void definitions. However, density-threshold methods preferentially select galaxies with b_i&lt;0, while watershed methods without density constraints include substantial contamination from high-bias boundary galaxies. The correlation between negative bias and void membership is systematically strengthened as the integrated underdensity threshold becomes less restrictive, with popcorn achieving the highest purity in isolating anti-biased populations.</description>

      <title>Statistics within UV-Visible Absorption Spectrum of Ethanolic Azobenzene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a statistical simulation of the UV--visible absorption spectrum of {\it trans}-azobenzene in ethanol solution. Due to intermolecular interactions, the used explicit solvent environment necessitates accounting for numerous transitions for a spectrum covering the two energetically lowest lines, S$_1$ and S$_2$. Furthermore, the spectrum manifests vast variation as a function of the underlying local structure, in conjunction with previous observations for spectra of liquids in the X-ray regime. We disentangle the complex structure--spectrum relationship using a machine learning-based method known as the emulator-based component analysis. This structural decomposition outperforms commonly used principal component analysis in explained spectral variation and reveals a small subset of latent structural variables responsible for the total spectral variance. Among other structural characteristics, blueshifting of the S$_2$ peak occurs with fewer hydrogen bonds with the ethanol solvent, and a contracted N=N bond within the C--N=N--C bridge. The observed structural dependence of the absorption spectrum thus implies an overrepresentation of certain structural classes after a photoexcitation, potentially significant for the subsequent nuclear dynamics, photophysics, and photochemistry.</description>
