      <title>From X-rays to High-Energy Gamma-rays: A Comprehensive Multi-Wavelength Study of Early Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) generate powerful relativistic jets that inject a large amount of energy into their surrounding environment, producing blast waves that accelerate particles to high energies. The GRB afterglow radiation provides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic shocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this study, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed between 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope and Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon energies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband spectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and high-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and energy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is modeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an SSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with expectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new benchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission, particularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines previous estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the most detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date. Notably, our results naturally account for the comparable energy output observed in both the soft X-ray and TeV bands, consistent with the previously detected TeV-GRBs.</description>

      <title>First X-ray and radio polarimetry of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 17+2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first polarimetric results of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) Z-source GX 17+2 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the Very Large Array (VLA). We find that the X-ray source was polarized at PD = 1.9 +/- 0.3 % (1-sigma errors) with a polarization angle of PA = 11 +/- 4 degree (1-sigma errors). Simultaneous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations show that the source was in the normal branch (NB) during our IXPE observations. The X-ray spectro-polarimetry results suggest a source geometry comprising an accretion disk component, a Comptonization component, and a reflection component. The VLA radio polarization study shows a PD = 2.2 +/- 0.2 % with a Faraday-corrected intrinsic polarization angle of 1 +/- 5 degree, which is an indication of the jet axis. Thus, we find the estimated X-ray PA from the source is consistent with the radio PA. We discuss the accretion geometry of the Z-source in light of our X-ray spectro-polarimetry and radio findings.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of high-energy radiation lasting from a fraction of a second to several hours. Military satellites made the first detections of GRBs in the late 1960s. The $\gamma$-ray emission forms from shocks in a relativistic jet launched from a compact central engine. In addition to the emission of $\gamma$-rays, the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium yields afterglow emission that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. Redshift measurements from these afterglows place GRBs from the local to the distant Universe. The central engines of GRBs are thought to be either a hyperaccreting black hole or a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar). There is now strong observational evidence that this central engine is created either in the core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star or via the merger of two compact objects (neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole). The combination of stellar scale events with extreme energies and luminosities makes GRBs powerful probes of the extreme physics involved in their production and of other areas of astrophysics and cosmology. These include as the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources, the production and acceleration of relativistic jets, the synthesis of heavy elements, the study of the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and the identification of the collapse of early generations of stars.</description>

      <title>Scalarized Hot Neutron Stars Containing Hyperons and $\Delta$-Resonances in Different Evolution Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity models are among the prime candidates to explain cosmic acceleration, and compact stars provide unique laboratories for testing such theories. Predictions of scalar-tensor gravity in compact stars can be examined during the evolution of neutron stars. Spontaneous scalarization in relativistic stars is influenced by different properties of stellar matter in various evolution regimes. In the present study, we investigate the scalarization of neutron stars in different stages of the evolvement. For this aim, we apply the isentropic equations of state for the neutron star matter including nucleons, hyperons, and $\Delta$- resonances in neutrino-trapped, neutrino diffusion, and neutrino-transparent stages as well as cold-catalyzed neutron star. Our equations of state are based on the relativistic model within the mean-field approximation. To emphasize the role of scalar-tensor theories in exploring the properties and structure of compact stars, we calculate the structure of neutron stars with hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances in different snapshots of the neutron star evolution in the scalar-tensor gravity. Our calculations confirm that the neutron star scalarization is affected by the hyperons as well as the $\Delta$-resonances. Moreover, the properties of scalarized neutron stars depend on the stage of the star evolution.</description>

      <title>On the statistical characterization of the synchrotron multi-zone polarization of blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiwavelength polarimetric observations of blazars reveal complex, energy-dependent polarization behavior, including a decrease in polarization fraction from X-rays to millimeter bands and significant variability in the electric vector position angle (EVPA). These trends challenge simple single-zone synchrotron models and suggest a more intricate, turbulent jet structure with multiple emission zones. We develop a statistical framework to model the observed energy-dependent polarization patterns in blazars, focusing on the behavior captured by IXPE in the X-ray band and RoboPol in the optical. The goal is to statistically characterize multi-zone models in terms of the distributions of cell size and the physical parameters of the electron energy distribution (EED). A Monte Carlo approach, implemented with the JetSeT code, is used to generate synthetic multi-zone synchrotron emission from a spherical region filled with turbulent cells with randomly distributed physical properties. Simulations explore scenarios ranging from identical cells to power-law distributions of cell sizes and EED parameters with variable cutoff and low-energy slopes. The results show that a purely turbulent, multi-zone model can reproduce the observed energy-dependent polarization without requiring correlations between cell size and EED parameters. The polarization degree is primarily determined by the effective, flux-weighted, number of emitting cells, modulated by the dispersion in cell properties, particularly the EED cutoff energy at high frequencies and the low-energy spectral index at low frequencies. With a fractional dispersion in cutoff energy of about 90% and a low-energy spectral index dispersion of ~0.5-1.5, the model reproduces the chromatic mm-to-X-ray polarization trends seen by IXPE and the optical polarization limiting envelope observed in the RoboPol dataset.</description>

      <title>SN 2021tsz: A luminous, short photospheric phase Type II supernova in a low-metallicity host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the luminous Type II Supernova (SN) 2021tsz, which exploded in a low-luminosity galaxy. It reached a peak magnitude of -18.88 $\pm$ 0.13 mag in the $r$ band and exhibited an initial rapid decline of 4.05 $\pm$ 0.14 mag (100 d)$^{-1}$ from peak luminosity till $\sim$30 d. The photospheric phase is short, with the SN displaying bluer colours and a weak H$\alpha$ absorption component--features consistent with other luminous, short-photospheric phase Type II SNe. A distinct transition from the photospheric to the radioactive tail phase in the $V$ band--as is common in hydrogen-rich Type II SNe--is not visible in SN 2021tsz, although a modest $\sim$1 mag drop is apparent in the redder filters. Hydrodynamic modelling suggests the luminosity is powered by ejecta-circumstellar material (CSM) interaction during the early phases (&lt;30 days). Interaction with 0.6 M$_\odot$ of dense CSM extending to 3100 R$_\odot$ reproduces the observed luminosity, with an explosion energy of 1.3$\times$10$^{51}$ erg. The modelling indicates a pre-SN mass of 9 M$_\odot$, which includes a hydrogen envelope of 4 M$_\odot$, and a radius of $\sim$1000 R$_\odot$. Spectral energy distribution analysis and strong-line diagnostics reveal that the host galaxy of SN 2021tsz is a low-metallicity, dwarf galaxy. The low-metallicity environment and the derived high mass loss from the hydrodynamical modelling strongly support a binary progenitor system for SN 2021tsz.</description>

      <title>The Gamma-ray Luminosity Function of Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have utilized the largest sample of $\gamma$-ray selected Fermi flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) ever used (519 sources) to construct the luminosity function and its evolution through the cosmic history. In addition to spanning large redshift ($0&lt;z\lesssim 4$) and luminosity ranges ($2.9\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ - $7.3\times10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$), this sample also has a robust calculation of the detection efficiency associated with its observation, making its selection effects and biases well understood. We confirm that the local luminosity function is best explained by a double power law. The evolution of the luminosity function of FSRQs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolution. FSRQs experience positive evolution with their space density growing with increasing redshift up to a maximum redshift, after which the numbers decrease. This peak in redshift occurs at larger redshifts for higher luminosity sources and at lower redshifts for lower luminosity sources. We find an unexpected similarity between the luminosity function of FSRQs and that of BL Lacertae objects at intermediate luminosity. This could be a sign of a strong genetic link between the two blazar sub-classes or that BL Lac samples are contaminated by large amounts of FSRQs with their jets nearly perfectly aligned with our line of sight.</description>

      <title>Gaussian process analysis of type-B quasiperiodic oscillations in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed Insight-HXMT data of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 during the type-B QPO phase of its 2019 outburst. Using the Gaussian process method, we applied an additive composite kernel model consisting of an SHO, a DRW, and an additional white noise (AWN) to data from three energy bands: LE (1-10 keV), ME (10-30 keV), and HE (30-150 keV). We find that for the DRW component, correlations on the timescale of $\tau_{\rm DRW}\sim10$ s are absent in the LE band, while they persist in the ME and HE bands over the full duration of the light curves. This energy-dependent behavior may reflect thermal instabilities, with the shorter correlation timescale in the disk compared to the corona. Alternatively, it may reflect variable Comptonizations of seed photons from different disk regions. Inner-disk photons are scattered by a small inner corona, producing soft X-rays. Outer-disk photons interact with an extended, jet-like corona, resulting in harder emission. The QPO is captured by an SHO component with a stable period of $\sim 0.2$ s and a high quality factor of $\sim 10$. The absence of significant evolution with energy or time of the SHO component suggests a connection between the accretion disk and the corona, which may be built by coherent oscillations of disk-corona driven by magnetorotational instability. The AWN components are present in all the three-band data and dominate over the DRW and SHO components. We interpret the AWN as another fast DRW with its $\tau_{\rm DRW} &lt; 0.01$ s. It may trace high-frequency fluctuations that occur in both the inner region of the accretion disk and the corona. Overall, our work reveals a timescale hierarchy in the coupled disk-corona scenario: fast DRW &lt; SHO &lt; disk DRW &lt; corona DRW.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Changing-Look behavior in AGN NGC 3822: A long-term multiwavelength study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive long-term multi-wavelength study of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 3822, based on 17 years (2008 to 2025) of X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and optical observations.The dataset includes observations from Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, the Very Large Telescope, and the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. Our multiwavelength light curve analysis reveals flux variations across X-ray to optical/UV bands, with an increased variability amplitude at shorter wavelengths. X-ray spectral analysis indicates the presence of intrinsic absorption during the 2016 and 2022 observations; however, this absorption disappeared before and after these epochs. The presence and absence of the absorber are attributed to clouds moving in and out of the line of sight. During the long-term monitoring period, the bolometric luminosity of the source varies between ($1.32-17)\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Optical spectroscopic monitoring reveals changing-look (CL) behaviour in NGC~3822, characterized by the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines (BELs). These CL transitions are associated with changes in the Eddington ratio rather than changes in the obscuration. The BELs appear only when the Eddington ratio is relatively high ($\sim 3.8\times10^{-3}$) and disappear when it drops to a lower value ($\sim 0.9\times10^{-3}$).</description>

      <title>Estimation of intrinsic fast radio burst width and scattering distributions from CRAFT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic width and scattering distributions of fast radio bursts (FRBs) inform on their emission mechanism and local environment, and act as a source of detection bias and, hence, an obfuscating factor when performing FRB population and cosmological studies. Here, we utilise a sample of 29 FRBs with measured high-time-resolution properties and known redshift, which were detected using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey (CRAFT), to model these distributions. Using this sample, we estimate the completeness bias of intrinsic width and scattering measurements, and fit the underlying, de-biased distributions in the host rest-frame. We find no evidence for a down-turn towards high values of the intrinsic distributions of either parameter in the 0.01-40 ms range probed by the data. Rather, the intrinsic scattering distribution at 1 GHz is consistent with a log-uniform distribution above 0.04 ms, while the intrinsic width distribution rises as a Gaussian in log-space in the 0.03-0.3 ms range, and is then log-uniform above that. This is inconsistent with previous works, which assumed that these parameters have lognormal distributions. This confirms that FRB observations are currently strongly width- and scattering-limited, and we encourage FRB searches to be extended to higher values of time-width. It also implies a bias in FRB host galaxy studies, although the form of that bias is uncertain. Finally, we find that our updated width and scattering model - when implemented in the zDM code - produces 10% more FRBs at redshift $z=1$ than at $z=0$ when compared to alternative width/scattering models, highlighting that these factors are important to understand when performing FRB population modelling.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Most Extreme Blazars: New Insights from MAGIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely high-peaked BL Lac objects (or extreme blazars) are unique extragalactic laboratories where particle acceleration processes are pushed at their physical limits. In these blazars, synchrotron emission peaking above keV energies is reprocessed to very-high-energy (VHE, energies &gt; 100 GeV) gamma rays, often resulting in very hard TeV spectra. Over the past two decades, they have attracted a growing interest from the scientific community, both experimentally and theoretically, as crucial targets for understanding the diversity within the blazar class. On the experimental side, new sources have been detected and characterized, populating the extreme blazars class. Notably, VHE campaigns have revealed evidence of emerging spectral differences in this energy band, suggesting inhomogeneity within this class of sources. Recent studies have also unveiled intriguing differences in the temporal evolution of their spectral emission. On the theoretical side, these spectral differences are challenging the current standard emission and acceleration models for blazars, suggesting the need for more complex theoretical frameworks. In this contribution, we present the latest results from recent MAGIC Collaboration observing campaigns aimed to enlarge the extreme blazars population at VHE and understand the origin of their extreme properties. Furthermore, we will present the results of the most recent observations, discussing analogies and differences with well-known sources such as the archetypal 1ES 0229+200, as well as interpretations of their non-conventional spectral emission.</description>

      <title>Convolution and Graph-based Deep Learning Approaches for Gamma/Hadron Separation in Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of $\gamma$-rays from the predominant hadronic-background is a key aspect in their ground-based detection using Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). While current methods are limited in their ability to exploit correlations in complex data, deep learning-based models offer a promising alternative by directly leveraging image-level information. However, several challenges involving the robustness and applicability of such models remain. Designing model architectures with inductive biases relevant for the task can help mitigate the problem. Three such deep learning-based models are proposed, trained, and evaluated on simulated data: (1) a hybrid convolutional and graph neural network model (CNN-GNN) using both image and graph data; (2) an enhanced CNN-GNN variant that incorporates additional reconstructed information within the graph construction; and (3) a graph neural network (GNN) model using image moments serving as a baseline. The new combined convolution and graph-based approach demonstrates improved performance over traditional methods, and the inclusion of reconstructed information offers further potential in generalization capabilities on real observational data.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from beyond the light cylinder in millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A striking aspect of the radio profiles of many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is that they consist of components separated from each other by regions lacking in emission. We devise a technique for determining "disjoint" from "contiguous" components and show that 35% of MSPs have disjoint components as opposed to only 3% of the slow pulsar population. We surmise that the pulsars with these disjoint components show evidence for both emission above the polar cap and from the current sheet beyond the light cylinder, co-located with gamma-ray emission. For a sub-class of radio MSPs only the light cylinder emission is being observed. It is our contention that almost all of the current population of gamma-ray MSPs show evidence for co-located radio emission. A simple geometric explanation allows the presence (or not) of light cylinder emission and the relationship (or not) between the gamma-ray and radio profiles to be determined. The light-cylinder components have frequently very high polarization and typically flat position-angle traverses thus helping to explain the difficulties in determining the geometry of MSPs. In cases where the geometry can be determined the values broadly align with expectations. If our picture is correct, the beaming fraction of radio MSPs is higher than previously thought and a mechanism is required to produce coherent radio emission far from the stellar surface. This has implications for our understanding of the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, and could relate to the timing stability of some of these sources.</description>

      <title>Hunting Very High-Energy ($&gt;$100 GeV) Emitting High-Synchrotron Peaked Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very-high energy (VHE; $&gt;$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission originates via some of the most extreme particle acceleration processes in the universe. Considering beamed active galactic nuclei, i.e., blazars, only a small fraction, mainly high synchrotron peak BL Lacs, have been detected in the VHE band with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. We utilized $\sim$16 years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations in the 0.1$-$2 TeV energy range to systematically search for potential VHE emitters in a sample of high synchrotron peaked ($\nu^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}&gt;10^{15}$ Hz) BL Lac sources. We identified, for the first time, 92 VHE emitting blazars at $\geq 5\sigma$ confidence level. A significant VHE emission was also detected from 52 objects, which have been previously reported to be a VHE blazar. Comparing with the general blazar population, these VHE emitting blazars are found to be located at low redshifts (mean $z=0.2 \pm 0.1$) and exhibit bright synchrotron emission ($\log F^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}=-11.2 \pm 0.4$, in erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). We also investigated the coincidence of VHE photon arrivals with the source activity states and found that Fermi-LAT has detected VHE photons during both quiescent and elevated activity epochs. These VHE emitting blazars represent promising targets for current and next-generation ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, and provide valuable laboratories for probing particle acceleration in relativistic jets, testing multi-messenger connections, and constraining extragalactic background light models.</description>

      <title>The gamma-ray emission from Radio Galaxies and their contribution to the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the contribution to the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background (IGRB) coming from Radio Galaxies (RGs), the subclass of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the highest misalignment from the line of sight (l.o.s.). Since only a small number of RGs are detected in gamma rays compared to the largest known radio population, the correlation between radio and gamma-ray emission serves as a crucial tool to characterize the gamma-ray properties of these sources. We analyse the population of RGs using two samples. The first sample contains 26 sources individually detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at gamma rays. The second sample contains 210 RGs for which the gamma-ray emission is not significantly detected by the LAT. We use a stacking analysis to characterize the average properties of the gamma-ray emission of the two samples, separately at first and then combined. We then evaluate the correlation between their gamma-ray emission and the emission from their radio core at 5 GHz, and we use it to determine their contribution to the IGRB. Due to the limited number of RGs detected at the gamma-rays, information on the gamma-ray luminosity function is limited. The correlation between the gamma-ray emission and the emission of the radio core allows us to characterize it starting from the luminosity function of the radio cores, which is modeled with greater accuracy due to the larger number of sources detected at these frequencies. We find that the diffuse emission as extrapolated from the properties of the subthreshold RGs is lower than the one inferred from detected RGs, showing that the contribution of the population of RGs to the IGRB is lower than the previous estimates and it is around the 30% level of the IGRB intensity.</description>

      <title>Rare Transients in Nearby Galaxies Explain Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays remains one of the central open questions in astroparticle physics. Recent measurements reveal anisotropies in arrival directions, a rigidity-dependent composition dominated by intermediate-mass nuclei, and striking hemispheric differences in the energy spectra. Here we show that rare transients in nearby galaxies can naturally account for these features. In our fiducial neutron-star merger model, the cosmic ray flux above $25$ EeV is dominated by ten nearby galaxies within $8\,$Mpc. This accounts for the observed hotspots: seven of the ten brightest galaxies coincide with reported excess regions, a chance probability of $p\simeq0.003$. Nearby transients also explain the spectral excess of TA over Auger; link their angular sizes to extragalactic magnetic fields at $\sim$1 nG; explain the dominance of individual species over narrow energy ranges; and the rigidity-aligned succession of isotopes.</description>

      <title>Torus feeding and outflow launching in the active nucleus of the Circinus galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Most active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to be surrounded by a dusty molecular torus on the parsec scale which is often embedded within a larger circumnuclear disk (CND). AGN are fuelled by the inward transport of material through these structures and can launch multi-phase outflows that influence the host galaxy through AGN feedback. Aims: We use the Circinus Galaxy as a nearby laboratory to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for feeding the torus and launching a multi-phase outflow in this Seyfert-type AGN, as these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: We analysed observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of the Circinus nucleus at angular resolutions down to 13 mas (0.25 pc). We traced dust and the ionised outflow using 86-665 GHz continuum emission, and studied the morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. Results: We find that the Circinus CND hosts molecular and dusty spiral arms, two of which connect directly to the torus. We detect inward mass transport along these structures and argue that the non-axisymmetric potential generated by these arms is the mechanism responsible for fuelling the torus. We estimate a feeding rate of 0.3-7.5 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, implying that over 88% of the inflowing material is expelled in a multi-phase outflow before reaching the accretion disk. The inferred torus feeding time scale (120 kyr - 2.7 Myr) suggests that variability in AGN activity may be driven by changes in torus feeding. On parsec scales, the ionised outflow is traced by optically thin free-free emission. The outflow is stratified, with a slightly wider opening angle in the molecular phase than in the dusty and ionised components. The ionised outflow is launched or collimated by a warped accretion disk at a radius of r ~ 0.16 pc, and its geometry requires an anisotropic launching mechanism.</description>

      <title>Binary Neutron Stars from the Moon: Early Warnings and Precision Science for the Artemis Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers are unique probes of matter at extreme density and standard candles of cosmic expansion. The only such event observed in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, GW170817, revealed the origin of heavy elements, constrained the neutron star equation of state, and provided an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Current detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA capture only the final minutes of inspiral, offering limited advance warning and coarse sky localization. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of binary neutron star signals for lunar-based gravitational-wave observatories (LILA, LGWA, GLOC) envisioned within NASA's Artemis and Commercial Lunar Payload Services programs, and compare their performance with current and next-generation Earth-based facilities. For GW170817-like sources, we find that lunar detectors can forecast mergers weeks to months in advance and localize them to areas as small as 0.01 deg$^{2}$, far beyond the reach of terrestrial detectors. We further show that lunar observatories would detect on the order of 100 well-localized mergers annually, enabling coordinated multi-messenger follow-up. When combined in a multi-band LIGO+Moon network, sky-localization areas shrink to just a few arcsec$^{2}$, comparable to the field of view of the James Webb Space Telescope at high zoom. Multi-band parameter estimation also delivers dramatic gains: neutron star mass-ratio uncertainties can be measured with $\sim0.1\%$ precision, spin constraints to 0.001$\%$ with luminosity distance errors to 1$\%$ level, enabling precision measurements of the equation of state and the cosmic expansion rate. Our results demonstrate that lunar gravitational-wave observatories would revolutionize multi-messenger astrophysics with binary neutron stars and open a unique discovery landscape in the Artemis era.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\rho^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Accretion, Jets, and Recoil in Merging Supermassive Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation that captures the full, self-consistent evolution from the late inspiral through merger and subsequent recoil of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) with misaligned spins embedded in an equilibrated circumbinary disk (CBD). Our full numerical simulation follows the final 40 orbits of the inspiral and merger of the binary, following an initial phase of 165 orbits of CBD evolution toward equilibrium. We find that the jets, launched from the minidisks surrounding each black hole, are tilted toward the black hole spin direction close to the individual black holes, but align with the binary's total angular momentum at larger distances. Following the merger, the remnant black hole receives a recoil kick exceeding 1000 km/s. Remarkably, it retains its gravitationally bound CBD as if it were ejected from a galactic nucleus. Furthermore, the jet launched by the recoiling remnant black hole preserves the large-scale orientation established during the late inspiral. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity emerges from a region in close proximity to the black hole, suggesting that the accretion disk surrounding the recoiling remnant would remain the most luminous feature postmerger, persisting for long enough to be observable by modern telescopes (hours in the case of LISA sources). These findings introduce a direct, first-principles model for the recoil of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), offering a comprehensive theoretical basis to support and elucidate both ongoing and future observational efforts.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Axion-Photon Coupling from Chandrayaan-2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) have gained immense attention in searches for beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. Experiments searching for axions leverage their predicted couplings to Standard Model (SM) particles to look for observable signals. Though weak, these couplings allow axions to be produced abundantly in the interiors of stars such as the Sun. Once created, axions can escape the Sun and while passing through the solar atmosphere, oscillate into photons in the magnetic field producing x-rays. For the first time, we used data from the observation of soft x-rays from the quiet Sun during the 2019-20 solar minimum by the solar x-ray monitor (XSM), onboard India's Chandrayaan-2 lunar exploration mission, to constrain the coupling of axions to photons ($g_{a \gamma \gamma}$). Using the latest models of the solar atmosphere to calculate the magnetic field and plasma frequency, we constrain $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \lesssim (0.47\,-\,2.2) \times 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95% confidence level for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$eV.</description>

      <title>Mass loading of outflows from evolving Young Massive Clusters</title>

Abstract: Feedback from Young Massive Clusters (YMCs) is an important driver of galaxy evolution. In the first few Myr, mechanical feedback is dominated by collective effects of the massive stellar winds in the YMC. The mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of these stars change by orders of magnitude over pre-SN timescales as the massive stars evolve, and mass-loss rates of Cool Supergiant (CSG) stars in particular are uncertain by a factor $\sim~20$ or more. In this work we perform a first study of the time evolution of average cluster wind velocity $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ as a function of stellar metallicity $Z$, assuming single star evolution. We also check the validity of assuming Wolf-Rayet stars dominate the feedback effects of a YMC, as often done when interpreting X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations, and test how sensitive $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ is to current uncertainties in mass-loss rates. We use pySTARBURST99 to calculate integrated properties of YMCs for $Z$ in the range of $0.0004-0.02$, representing a range of environments from IZw18 to the Galactic Centre. We find that $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ drops off rapidly for sub-LMC $Z$, and we recommend a value of $500-1000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ be used in this regime. We show accounting only for WR stars can overestimate $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ by $500-2000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ at $Z \geq Z_\text{LMC}$. We also find that different RSG mass-loss assumptions can change the inferred $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ by $\sim1000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$, highlighting the need for improved observational constraints for RSGs in YMCs.</description>

      <title>Resolving Star Cluster Formation in Galaxy Simulations with Cosmic Ray Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star clusters host the massive stars responsible for feedback in star-forming galaxies. Stellar feedback shapes the interstellar medium (ISM), affecting the formation of future star clusters. To self-consistently capture the interplay between feedback and star formation, a model must resolve the parsec-scale star formation sites and the multiphase ISM. Additionally, the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on star formation rates (SFRs) must also be considered. We present the first simulations of the formation of an ensemble of star clusters with dynamically-coupled CRs, near-individual star particles, and a feedback-regulated ISM. We analyze tallbox simulations performed using the CRISP model in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We apply varied implementations of CR transport under the theory of self-confinement. We find that CRs simultaneously reduce the SFR, the power law slope of the cluster mass function, and the cluster formation efficiency. Each simulation is compatible with observations, and CR feedback tends to move results along observed star cluster relations. We see only modest changes in cluster radius and velocity dispersions, but significant differences in the virial parameters. Ultimately, the primary impact of CRs is to reduce SFRs. Lower SFRs imply fewer supernovae, and consequently a lower turbulent energy budget for gas. Star clusters formed in a CR-regulated ISM have lower velocity dispersions, and are therefore more bound under self-gravity. The effective clustering of SNe is unchanged by CRs. Through this work, we demonstrate the predictive power of the CRISP feedback model, despite this idealized setup.</description>

      <title>100,000 Crab giant pulses at 215 MHz detected with an SKA-Low prototype station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report detection and analysis of the largest low-frequency (200 - 231.25 MHz) sample of Crab giant pulses (GPs) reported in the literature. In total about 95000 GPs were detected. The observations were performed in 2024/2025 with the EDA2, a prototype station of the SKA-Low telescope. The fluence distribution of GPs in the entire sample is very well characterised with a single power law (no flattening at higher fluences) N(F) $\propto$ F$^\alpha$, where $\alpha = -3.17\pm0.02$ for all GPs, and $\alpha_{MP} = -3.13\pm0.02$ and $\alpha_{IP} = -3.59\pm0.06$ for GPs at the phases of the main pulse and interpulse respectively. The index of the power law fluence distribution remained approximately constant over the observing period, but the normalisation of the distribution was strongly correlated with the scatter broadening time ($\tau$). As a result, the measured fluence distribution increased for lower ($\tau \approx$ 2 ms) and decreased for higher ($\tau \approx$ 5 ms) scatter broadening time $\tau$ causing the GP rate to vary between 3000 and 100 per hour respectively. The timescale of variations (weeks) indicates refractive scintillation as the root cause. We also observe a strong positive correlation between the scatter broadening time and dispersion measure. Our modelling favours the screen of the size $\sim10^{-5}$ pc and mean electron density $\sim 400$e$^{-}$cm$^{-3}$ located within 100 pc from the pulsar. The frequency scaling of the scattering broadening time ($\tau \propto \nu^{\beta}$) with $\beta \approx -3.6\pm0.1$ is in agreement with earlier measurements. Our results agree with the current views that GPs from extra-galactic Crab-like pulsars can be responsible for very weak repeating FRBs, but cannot explain the entire FRB population. Finally, these results demonstrate an enormous scientific potential of individual SKA-Low stations.</description>

      <title>{\tt RapidGBM}: An Efficient Tool for Fermi-GBM Visibility Checking and Data Analysis with a Case Study of EP240617a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a lightweight tool, {\tt RapidGBM}, featuring a web-based interface and capabilities of rapid calculation of Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) visibilities and performance of basic data analysis. It has two key features: (1) it can immediately check the visibility of Fermi-GBM for new transients, and (2) it can check the light curve and perform spectral analysis after the hourly Time-Tagger Event data are released. The visibility check and the response matrix generation required for spectral analysis can be achieved through the historical pointing file after the orbit calculation, even when the real-time pointing file is not yet available. As a case study, we apply the tool to EP240617a, an X-ray transient triggered by Einstein Probe (EP). We demonstrate the workflow of visibility checking, data processing, and spectral analysis for this event. The results suggest that EP240617a can be classified as an X-ray-rich gamma-ray burst (XRR) and confirm the feasibility of using historical pointing files for rapid analysis. Further, we discuss possible physical interpretations of such events, including implications for jet launching and progenitor scenarios. Therefore, {\tt RapidGBM} is expected to assist EP Transient Advocates, Space-based multiband astronomical Variable Objects Monitor burst advocates, and other members of the community in cross checking high-energy transients. Based on prompt emission parameter relations (e.g. $E_{\rm p}$-$E_{\gamma,\rm iso}$), it can also help identify peculiar GRBs (e.g. long-short burst, magnetar giant flare, etc.) and provide useful references (e.g. more accurate $T_0$) for scheduling follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae: a model for SN2022jli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 3D hydrodynamical modelling of supernova-induced binary-interaction-powered supernovae; a scenario proposed for the peculiar type Ic supernova SN2022jli. In this scenario, supernova ejecta of a stripped-envelope star impact a close-by stellar companion, temporarily inflating the envelope. The expanded envelope engulfs the neutron star, causing strong mass accretion at super-Eddington rates. Feedback from the accretion powers the supernova light curve with periodic undulations. Our simulations capture key features of SN2022jli, both the overall decline and the superimposed undulations of the light curve. Based on our parameter study, we find that (i) the accretion feedback should be sufficiently geometrically confined and (ii) the eccentricity of the post-supernova binary orbit should be $0.8\lesssim e\lesssim0.9$ to sustain a high accretion rate and match the low undulation amplitude ($\Delta L/L\sim0.1$) of SN2022jli. Different combinations of parameters could account for other supernovae like SN2022mop, SN2009ip and SN2015ap, which have varying undulation periods and amplitudes. We also discuss possible explanations for other key features of SN2022jli such as the $\gamma$-ray detection at $\sim200~\mathrm{d}$ and the rapid optical drop at $\sim250~\mathrm{d}$. Finally, we speculate on the future evolution of the system and its relation to existing neutron star binaries.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and nuclear symmetry energy from neutron star observations: Constraints in light of PSR J0614--3329</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possible occurrence of a first-order hadron-quark phase transition (FOPT) in neutron-star interiors remains an open question. Whether such a transition can be directly tested with improved observations is a key challenge. Here, we incorporate the latest constraints, especially a new NICER radius measurement for PSR J0614--3329, into a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) EOS framework that explicitly includes a first-order transition. We find a Bayes factor of $B\approx2.3$ when comparing models with and without an explicit phase transition, marginally favoring its presence. At $68\%$ credibility, the transition onset density $n_{\rm PT}$ is either below $2\,n_s$ (corresponding to masses $\lesssim1\,M_\odot$, with density jump $\Delta n\sim0.5\,n_s$) or, more prominently, above $4\,n_s$ (near the central density of the heaviest NS, with $\Delta n\sim3\,n_s$), where $n_s$ represents the nuclear saturation density. In addition, by using symmetry-energy expansion at low densities ($&lt;1.1\,n_s$), we infer a slope parameter $L=40.2^{+19.3}_{-14.3}$ MeV, in good agreement with nuclear-experiment values. Intriguingly, $L$ correlates positively with the radius difference between $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.0\,M_\odot$ stars.</description>

      <title>Diffusive shock acceleration: non-classical model of cosmic ray transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work the theory of diffusive shock acceleration is extended to the case of non-classical particle transport with L\'{e}vy flights and L\'{e}vy traps, when the mean square displacement grows nonlinearly with time. In this approach the Green function is not a Gaussian but it exhibits power-law tails. By using the propagator appropriate for non-classical diffusion, it is found for the first time that energy spectral index of particles accelerated at shock front is $\gamma = [\alpha (\mathrm{r} + 5) - 6 \beta]/[\alpha(\mathrm{r}-1)]$, where $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2$ and $0 &lt;\beta &lt; 1$ are the exponents of power-law behavior of L\'{e}vy flights and L\'{e}vy traps, respectively.
  We note that this result coincides with standard slope at $\alpha=2, \beta=1$ (normal diffusion), and also includes those obtained earlier for the subdiffusion ($\alpha=2, \beta&lt;1$) and superdiffusion ($\alpha&lt;2, \beta=1$) regimes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical equilibria of fast neutrino flavor conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak interaction, have deep parallels with mean-field kinetic systems governed by other fundamental forces. We identify analogues in fast flavor conversion (FFC) of some time-honored nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and self-gravitating systems. We focus in particular on nonlinear Landau damping and collisionless equilibria, which are likely important pieces of the unsolved puzzle of neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our analysis additionally reveals the previously unexplored phenomenon of flavor-wave synchronization.</description>

      <title>On the Universality of Energy Extraction from Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The launching of astrophysical jets provides the most compelling observational evidence for direct extraction of black hole (BH) spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. Whilst it is known that spinning Kerr BHs within general relativity (GR) follow the BZ jet power relation, the nature of BH energy extraction in general theories of gravity has not been adequately addressed. This study performs the first comprehensive investigation of the BZ jet power relation by utilizing a generalized BH spacetime geometry which describes parametric deviations from the Kerr metric of GR, yet recovers the Kerr metric in the limit that all deviation parameters vanish. Through performing and analyzing an extensive suite of three-dimensional covariant magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of magnetized gas accretion onto these generalized BH spacetimes we find that the BZ jet power relation still holds, in some instances yielding jet powers far in excess of what can be produced by even extremal Kerr BHs. It is shown that independent variation of the frame-dragging rate of the BH can enhance or suppress the effects of BH spin, and by extension of frame-dragging. This variation greatly enhances or suppresses the observed jet power and underlying photon ring image asymmetry, introducing a previously unexplored yet important degeneracy in BH parameter inference. Finally we show that sufficiently accurate measurements of the jet power, accretion rate and photon ring properties from supermassive BHs can potentially break this degeneracy, highlighting the need of independent investigations of BH frame-dragging from observations.</description>

      <title>On the (Im)possibility of Electrically Charged Planck Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I revisit whether black-hole remnants, from sub-Planckian compact objects to Planck relics and up to (super)massive black holes, can preserve Standard-Model (SM) electric charge. Two exterior-field mechanisms -- Coulomb-focused capture from ambient media and QED Schwinger pair production -- robustly neutralize such objects across cosmic history. I first derive the general capture rate including both Coulomb and gravitational focusing, and sum the stepwise discharge time in closed form via the trigamma function, exhibiting transparent Coulomb- and gravity-dominated limits. I then integrate the Schwinger rate over the near-horizon region to obtain an explicit $\dot Q(Q)$ law: discharge proceeds until the horizon field falls below $E_{\rm crit}$, leaving a residual charge $Q_{\rm stop}^{(e)}\!\propto\! r_h^2$ that is $\ll e$ for Planck radii. Mapping the mass dependence from sub-Planckian to astrophysical scales, I also analyze dark-sector charges with heavy carriers (including kinetic mixing and massive mediators). In a conservative ``no-Schwinger'' limit where vacuum pair creation is absent, cumulative ambient exposures alone force discharge of any integer SM charge. Three possible loopholes remain. (i) A fine-tuned SM corner in which the relic sits arbitrarily close to Reissner-Nordstr\"om extremality so greybody factors suppress charged absorption, while Schwinger pair creation is absent due to Planck-scale physics. (ii) Charge relocated to a hidden $U(1)_D$ with no light opposite carriers, e.g. if the lightest state is very heavy and/or kinetic mixing with $U(1)_{\rm EM}$ is vanishingly small. (iii) Discrete or topological charges rather than ordinary SM electric charge. Outside these cases, the conclusion is robust: within SM electromagnetism, charged black-hole relics neutralize efficiently and cannot retain charge over cosmological times.</description>
