      <title>Stabilising Lifetime PD Models under Forecast Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating lifetime probabilities of default (PDs) under IFRS~9 and CECL requires projecting point--in--time transition matrices over multiple years. A persistent weakness is that macroeconomic forecast errors compound across horizons, producing unstable and volatile PD term structures. This paper reformulates the problem in a state--space framework and shows that a direct Kalman filter leaves non--vanishing variability. We then introduce an anchored observation model, which incorporates a neutral long--run economic state into the filter. The resulting error dynamics exhibit asymptotic stochastic stability, ensuring convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure. Simulation on a synthetic corporate portfolio confirms that anchoring reduces forecast noise and delivers smoother, more interpretable projections.</description>

      <title>Why Bonds Fail Differently? Explainable Multimodal Learning for Multi-Class Default Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT (Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series (financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability. Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.</description>

      <title>Enhancing ML Models Interpretability for Credit Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting default is essential for banks to ensure profitability and financial stability. While modern machine learning methods often outperform traditional regression techniques, their lack of transparency limits their use in regulated environments. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a solution in domains like credit scoring. However, most XAI research focuses on post-hoc interpretation of black-box models, which does not produce models lightweight or transparent enough to meet regulatory requirements, such as those for Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) models.
  This paper proposes a hybrid approach: post-hoc interpretations of black-box models guide feature selection, followed by training glass-box models that maintain both predictive power and transparency.
  Using the Lending Club dataset, we demonstrate that this approach achieves performance comparable to a benchmark black-box model while using only 10 features - an 88.5% reduction. In our example, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used for feature selection, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) serves as the benchmark and the base black-box model, and Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) and Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR) are the investigated glass-box models.
  We also show that model refinement using feature interaction analysis, correlation checks, and expert input can further enhance model interpretability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Factor Models with Forward-Looking Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction models calibrated using historical data may forecast poorly if the dynamics of the present and future differ from observations in the past. For this reason, predictions can be improved if information like forward looking views about the state of the system are used to refine the forecast. We develop an approach for combining a dynamic factor model for risky asset prices calibrated on historical data, and noisy expert views of future values of the factors/covariates in the model, and study the implications for dynamic portfolio choice. By exploiting the graphical structure linking factors, asset prices, and views, we derive closed-form expressions for the dynamics of the factor and price processes after conditioning on the views. For linear factor models, the price process becomes a time-inhomogeneous affine process with a new covariate formed from the views. We establish a novel theoretical connection between the conditional factor process and a process we call a Mean-Reverting Bridge (MrB), an extension of the classical Brownian bridge. We derive the investor's optimal portfolio strategy and show that views influence both the myopic mean-variance term and the intertemporal hedge. The optimal dynamic portfolio when the long-run mean of the expected return is uncertain and learned online from data is also derived. More generally, our framework offers a generalizable approach for embedding forward-looking information about covariates in a dynamic factor model.</description>

      <title>Modelling the term-structure of default risk under IFRS 9 within a multistate regression framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lifetime behaviour of loans is notoriously difficult to model, which can compromise a bank's financial reserves against future losses, if modelled poorly. Therefore, we present a data-driven comparative study amongst three techniques in modelling a series of default risk estimates over the lifetime of each loan, i.e., its term-structure. The behaviour of loans can be described using a nonstationary and time-dependent semi-Markov model, though we model its elements using a multistate regression-based approach. As such, the transition probabilities are explicitly modelled as a function of a rich set of input variables, including macroeconomic and loan-level inputs. Our modelling techniques are deliberately chosen in ascending order of complexity: 1) a Markov chain; 2) beta regression; and 3) multinomial logistic regression. Using residential mortgage data, our results show that each successive model outperforms the previous, likely as a result of greater sophistication. This finding required devising a novel suite of simple model diagnostics, which can itself be reused in assessing sampling representativeness and the performance of other modelling techniques. These contributions surely advance the current practice within banking when conducting multistate modelling. Consequently, we believe that the estimation of loss reserves will be more timeous and accurate under IFRS 9.</description>
