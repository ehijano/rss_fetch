      <title>Characterizing the Conformational States of G Protein Coupled Receptors Generated with AlphaFold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are integral to numerous physiological processes and are the target of approximately one-third of FDA-approved therapeutics. Despite their significance, only a limited subset of GPCRs has been successfully targeted, primarily due to challenges in accurately modeling their structures. AlphaFold, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, has demonstrated remarkable capability in predicting protein structures with high accuracy. This study conducts an evaluation of AlphaFold performance in predicting GPCR structures and their conformational states by comparing its predictions to experimentally determined structures using metrics such as average deformation between alpha carbon atoms and the Helix 3 - Helix 6 (H3-H6) distance. Our analysis reveals that both AlphaFold 2 (AF2) and AlphaFold 3 (AF3) produce more accurate predictions for GPCRs in inactive conformations, with lower activity levels correlating with smaller deformations. Conversely, higher activity levels are associated with increased variability in AlphaFold performance due to difficulties with accurately predicting conformational changes upon GPCR activation and ligand binding. Additionally, AlphaFold performance varies across different GPCR classes, influenced by the availability and quality of training data as well as the structural complexity and diversity of the receptors. These findings demonstrate the potential of AlphaFold in advancing drug discovery efforts, while also highlighting the necessity for continued refinement to enhance predictive accuracy for active conformations.</description>

      <title>Exploring proteomic signatures in sepsis and non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The search for new biomarkers that allow an early diagnosis in sepsis has become a necessity in medicine. The objective of this study is to identify potential protein biomarkers of differential expression between sepsis and non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (NISIRS).
  Methods: Prospective observational study of a cohort of septic patients activated by the Sepsis Code and patients admitted with NISIRS, during the period 2016-2017. A mass spectrometry-based approach was used to analyze the plasma proteins in the enrolled subjects. Subsequently, using recursive feature elimination (RFE) classification and cross-validation with a vector classifier, an association of these proteins in patients with sepsis compared to patients with NISIRS. The protein-protein interaction network was analyzed with String software.
  Results: A total of 277 patients (141 with sepsis and 136 with NISIRS) were included. After performing RFE, 25 proteins in the study patient cohort showed statistical significance, with an accuracy of 0.960, specificity of 0.920, sensitivity of 0.973, and an AUC of 0.985. Of these, 14 proteins (vWF, PPBP, C5, C1RL, FCN3, SAA2, ORM1, ITIH3, GSN, C1QA, CA1, CFB, C3, LBP) have a greater relationship with sepsis while 11 proteins (FN1, IGFALS, SERPINA4, APOE, APOH, C6, SERPINA3, AHSG, LUM, ITIH2, SAA1) are more expressed in NISIRS.</description>

      <title>Neural Graph Matching Improves Retrieval Augmented Generation in Molecular Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular machine learning has gained popularity with the advancements of geometric deep learning. In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%. Moreover, MARASON outperforms both naive retrieval-augmented generation methods and traditional graph matching approaches.</description>

      <title>A single-snapshot inverse solver for two-species graph model of tau pathology spreading in human Alzheimer disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method that uses a two-species ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to characterize misfolded tau (or simply tau) protein spreading in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and calibrates it from clinical data. The unknown model parameters are the initial condition (IC) for tau and three scalar parameters representing the migration, proliferation, and clearance of tau proteins. Driven by imaging data, these parameters are estimated by formulating a constrained optimization problem with a sparsity regularization for the IC. This optimization problem is solved with a projection-based quasi-Newton algorithm. We investigate the sensitivity of our method to different algorithm parameters. We evaluate the performance of our method on both synthetic and clinical data. The latter comprises cases from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets: 455 cognitively normal (CN), 212 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 45 AD subjects. We compare the performance of our approach to the commonly used Fisher-Kolmogorov (FK) model with a fixed IC at the entorhinal cortex (EC). Our method demonstrates an average improvement of 25.7% relative error compared to the FK model on the AD dataset. HFK also achieves an R-squared score of 0.664 for fitting AD data compared with 0.55 from FK model results under the same optimization scheme. Furthermore, for cases that have longitudinal data, we estimate a subject-specific AD onset time.</description>

      <title>Enhancing selectivity using Wasserstein distance based reweighing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two labeled data-sets $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{T}$, we design a simple and efficient greedy algorithm to reweigh the loss function such that the limiting distribution of the neural network weights that result from training on $\mathcal{S}$ approaches the limiting distribution that would have resulted by training on $\mathcal{T}$.
  On the theoretical side, we prove that when the metric entropy of the input datasets is bounded, our greedy algorithm outputs a close to optimal reweighing, i.e., the two invariant distributions of network weights will be provably close in total variation distance. Moreover, the algorithm is simple and scalable, and we prove bounds on the efficiency of the algorithm as well.
  As a motivating application, we train a neural net to recognize small molecule binders to MNK2 (a MAP Kinase, responsible for cell signaling) which are non-binders to MNK1 (a highly similar protein). In our example dataset, of the 43 distinct small molecules predicted to be most selective from the enamine catalog, 2 small molecules were experimentally verified to be selective, i.e., they reduced the enzyme activity of MNK2 below 50\% but not MNK1, at 10$\mu$M -- a 5\% success rate.</description>

      <title>Assessing the similarity of real matrices with arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the similarity of matrices is valuable for analyzing the extent to which data sets exhibit common features in tasks such as data clustering, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, group comparison, and graph analysis. Methods proposed for comparing vectors, such as cosine similarity, can be readily generalized to matrices. However, this approach usually neglects the inherent two-dimensional structure of matrices. Here, we propose singular angle similarity (SAS), a measure for evaluating the structural similarity between two arbitrary, real matrices of the same shape based on singular value decomposition. After introducing the measure, we compare SAS with standard measures for matrix comparison and show that only SAS captures the two-dimensional structure of matrices. Further, we characterize the behavior of SAS in the presence of noise and as a function of matrix dimensionality. Finally, we apply SAS to two use cases: square non-symmetric matrices of probabilistic network connectivity, and non-square matrices representing neural brain activity. For synthetic data of network connectivity, SAS matches intuitive expectations and allows for a robust assessment of similarities and differences. For experimental data of brain activity, SAS captures differences in the structure of high-dimensional responses to different stimuli. We conclude that SAS is a suitable measure for quantifying the shared structure of matrices with arbitrary shape.</description>
