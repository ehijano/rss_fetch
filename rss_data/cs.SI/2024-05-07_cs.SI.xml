      <title>Large Language Models as Instruments of Power: New Regimes of Autonomous Manipulation and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a wide variety of rhetorical styles and generate text that expresses a broad spectrum of sentiments. This capacity, now available at low cost, makes them powerful tools for manipulation and control. In this paper, we consider a set of underestimated societal harms made possible by the rapid and largely unregulated adoption of LLMs. Rather than consider LLMs as isolated digital artefacts used to displace this or that area of work, we focus on the large-scale computational infrastructure upon which they are instrumentalised across domains. We begin with discussion on how LLMs may be used to both pollute and uniformize information environments and how these modalities may be leveraged as mechanisms of control. We then draw attention to several areas of emerging research, each of which compounds the capabilities of LLMs as instruments of power. These include (i) persuasion through the real-time design of choice architectures in conversational interfaces (e.g., via "AI personas"), (ii) the use of LLM-agents as computational models of human agents (e.g., "silicon subjects"), (iii) the use of LLM-agents as computational models of human agent populations (e.g., "silicon societies") and finally, (iv) the combination of LLMs with reinforcement learning to produce controllable and steerable strategic dialogue models. We draw these strands together to discuss how these areas may be combined to build LLM-based systems that serve as powerful instruments of individual, social and political control via the simulation and disingenuous "prediction" of human behaviour, intent, and action.</description>

      <title>Association between centrality and flourishing trait: analyzing student co-occurrence networks drawn from dining activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehending the association between social capabilities and individual psychological traits is paramount for educational administrators. Presently, many studies heavily depend on online questionnaires and self-reported data, while analysis of the connection between offline social networks and mental health status remains scarce. By leveraging a public dataset encompassing on-campus dining activities over 21 weeks, we establish student co-occurrence networks and closely observe the changes in network topology over time. Empirical analysis shows that the node centralities of the student co-occurrence networks exhibit significantly positive correlation with the enhancement of the flourishing trait within the field of mental well-being. Our findings offer potential guidance for assisting students in maintaining a positive mental health status.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Regional Importance in Cities with Human Mobility Motifs in Metro Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies within human mobility networks offers valuable insights into the analysis of urban structures. In most existing studies, human mobility networks are typically constructed by aggregating all trips without distinguishing who takes which specific trip. Instead, we claim individual mobility motifs, higher-order structures generated by daily trips of people, as fundamental units of human mobility networks. In this paper, we propose two network construction frameworks at the level of mobility motifs in characterizing regional importance in cities. Firstly, we enhance the structural dependencies within mobility motifs and proceed to construct mobility networks based on the enhanced mobility motifs. Secondly, taking inspiration from PageRank, we speculate that people would allocate values of importance to destinations according to their trip intentions. A motif-wise network construction framework is proposed based on the established mechanism. Leveraging large-scale metro data across cities, we construct three types of human mobility networks and characterize the regional importance by node importance indicators. Our comparison results suggest that the motif-based mobility network outperforms the classic mobility network, thus highlighting the efficacy of the introduced human mobility motifs. Finally, we demonstrate that the performance in characterizing the regional importance is significantly improved by our motif-wise framework.</description>

      <title>Community Detection for Heterogeneous Multiple Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The community plays a crucial role in understanding user behavior and network characteristics in social networks. Some users can use multiple social networks at once for a variety of objectives. These users are called overlapping users who bridge different social networks. Detecting communities across multiple social networks is vital for interaction mining, information diffusion, and behavior migration analysis among networks. This paper presents a community detection method based on nonnegative matrix tri-factorization for multiple heterogeneous social networks, which formulates a common consensus matrix to represent the global fused community. Specifically, the proposed method involves creating adjacency matrices based on network structure and content similarity, followed by alignment matrices which distinguish overlapping users in different social networks. With the generated alignment matrices, the method could enhance the fusion degree of the global community by detecting overlapping user communities across networks. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated with new metrics on Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr datasets. The results of the experiments demonstrate its superior performance in terms of community quality and community fusion.</description>

      <title>BBK: a simpler, faster algorithm for enumerating maximal bicliques in large sparse bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite graphs are a prevalent modeling tool for real-world networks, capturing interactions between vertices of two different types. Within this framework, bicliques emerge as crucial structures when studying dense subgraphs: they are sets of vertices such that all vertices of the first type interact with all vertices of the second type. Therefore, they allow identifying groups of closely related vertices of the network, such as individuals with similar interests or webpages with similar contents. This article introduces a new algorithm designed for the exhaustive enumeration of maximal bicliques within a bipartite graph. This algorithm, called BBK for Bipartite Bron-Kerbosch, is a new extension to the bipartite case of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, which enumerates the maximal cliques in standard (non-bipartite) graphs. It is faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms and allows the enumeration on massive bipartite graphs that are not manageable with existing implementations. We analyze it theoretically to establish two complexity formulas: one as a function of the input and one as a function of the output characteristics of the algorithm. We also provide an open-access implementation of BBK in C++, which we use to experiment and validate its efficiency on massive real-world datasets and show that its execution time is shorter in practice than state-of-the art algorithms. These experiments also show that the order in which the vertices are processed, as well as the choice of one of the two types of vertices on which to initiate the enumeration have an impact on the computation time.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Joint Estimation of Temporal Vertex and Edge Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adaptive estimation of coexisting temporal vertex (node) and edge signals on graphs is a critical task when a change in edge signals influences the temporal dynamics of the vertex signals. However, the current Graph Signal Processing algorithms mostly consider only the signals existing on the graph vertices and have neglected the fact that signals can reside on the edges. We propose an Adaptive Joint Vertex-Edge Estimation (AJVEE) algorithm for jointly estimating time-varying vertex and edge signals through a time-varying regression, incorporating both vertex signal filtering and edge signal filtering. Accompanying AJVEE is a newly proposed Adaptive Least Mean Square procedure based on the Hodge Laplacian (ALMS-Hodge), which is inspired by classical adaptive filters combining simplicial filtering and simplicial regression. AJVEE is able to operate jointly on the vertices and edges by merging two ALMS-Hodge algorithms specified on the vertices and edges into a unified formulation. A more generalized case extending AJVEE beyond the vertices and edges is being discussed. Experimenting on real-world traffic networks and population mobility networks, we have confirmed that our proposed AJVEE algorithm could accurately and jointly track time-varying vertex and edge signals on graphs.</description>

      <title>Link Me Baby One More Time: Social Music Discovery on Spotify</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the social and contextual factors that influence the outcome of person-to-person music recommendations and discovery. Specifically, we use data from Spotify to investigate how a link sent from one user to another results in the receiver engaging with the music of the shared artist. We consider several factors that may influence this process, such as the strength of the sender-receiver relationship, the user's role in the Spotify social network, their music social cohesion, and how similar the new artist is to the receiver's taste. We find that the receiver of a link is more likely to engage with a new artist when (1) they have similar music taste to the sender and the shared track is a good fit for their taste, (2) they have a stronger and more intimate tie with the sender, and (3) the shared artist is popular amongst the receiver's connections. Finally, we use these findings to build a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a shared music track will result in the receiver's engagement with the shared artist. This model elucidates which type of social and contextual features are most predictive, although peak performance is achieved when a diverse set of features are included. These findings provide new insights into the multifaceted mechanisms underpinning the interplay between music discovery and social processes.</description>

      <title>Recommendation Fairness in Social Networks Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In social recommender systems, it is crucial that the recommendation models provide equitable visibility for different demographic groups, such as gender or race. Most existing research has addressed this problem by only studying individual static snapshots of networks that typically change over time. To address this gap, we study the evolution of recommendation fairness over time and its relation to dynamic network properties. We examine three real-world dynamic networks by evaluating the fairness of six recommendation algorithms and analyzing the association between fairness and network properties over time. We further study how interventions on network properties influence fairness by examining counterfactual scenarios with alternative evolution outcomes and differing network properties. Our results on empirical datasets suggest that recommendation fairness improves over time, regardless of the recommendation method. We also find that two network properties, minority ratio, and homophily ratio, exhibit stable correlations with fairness over time. Our counterfactual study further suggests that an extreme homophily ratio potentially contributes to unfair recommendations even with a balanced minority ratio. Our work provides insights into the evolution of fairness within dynamic networks in social science. We believe that our findings will help system operators and policymakers to better comprehend the implications of temporal changes and interventions targeting fairness in social networks.</description>

      <title>Effective Edge Ranking via Random Walk with Restart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a network G, edge centrality is a metric used to evaluate the importance of edges in G, which is a key concept in analyzing networks and finds vast applications involving edge ranking. In spite of a wealth of research on devising edge centrality measures, they incur either prohibitively high computation costs or varied deficiencies that lead to sub-optimal ranking quality.
  To overcome their limitations, this paper proposes EdgeRAKE, a new centrality measure for edge ranking that leverages the novel notion of the edgewise random walk with restart. Based thereon, we present a linear-complexity algorithm for EdgeRAKE approximation, followed by an in-depth theoretical analysis in terms of various aspects. Extensive experiments comparing EdgeRAKE against six edge centrality metrics in graph analytics tasks on real networks showcase that EdgeRAKE offers superior practical effectiveness without significantly reducing computation efficiency</description>

      <title>Reverse Influential Community Search Over Social Networks (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an important fundamental task of numerous real-world applications such as social network analysis and online advertising/marketing, several prior works studied influential community search, which retrieves a community with high structural cohesiveness and maximum influences on other users in social networks. However, previous works usually considered the influences of the community on arbitrary users in social networks, rather than specific groups (e.g., customer groups, or senior communities). Inspired by this, we propose a novel Reverse Influential Community Search (RICS) problem, which obtains a seed community with the maximum influence on a user-specified target community, satisfying both structural and keyword constraints. To efficiently tackle the RICS problem, we design effective pruning strategies to filter out false alarms of candidate seed communities, and propose an effective index mechanism to facilitate the community retrieval. We also formulate and tackle an RICS variant, named Relaxed Reverse Influential Community Search (R2ICS), which returns a subgraph with the relaxed structural constraints and having the maximum influence on a user-specified target community. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our RICS and R2ICS approaches on both real-world and synthetic social networks under various parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction via the minimum description length principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status quo in this context is based on $L_{1}$ regularization combined with cross-validation. However, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight "shrinkage". This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of edges to be known in advance. We also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in the order of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ species, and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of interventions in the system.</description>
