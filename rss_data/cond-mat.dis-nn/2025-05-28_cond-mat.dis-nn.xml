      <title>Finding the right path: statistical mechanics of connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study a statistical mechanics ensemble that characterizes connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Built around a well-known local entropy bias, it allows us to better identify hardness transitions in problems where the energy landscape is dominated by isolated solutions. We apply this new device to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its manifold of connected solutions behaves. We choose this particular problem because, while its typical solutions are isolated, it can be solved using local algorithms for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. With this new ensemble, we unveil the presence of a cluster composed of delocalized connected solutions. In particular, we demonstrate its stability until a critical threshold $\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$ (dependent on $\alpha$). This transition appears as paths of solutions shatter, a phenomenon that more conventional statistical mechanics approaches fail to grasp. Finally, we compared our predictions to simulations. For this, we used a modified Monte-Carlo algorithm, designed specifically to target these delocalized solutions. We obtained, as predicted, that the algorithm finds solutions until $\kappa\approx\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$.</description>

      <title>Quantized Transport of Disordered Superconducting $\nu=2/3$ Fractional Quantum Hall Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states, which have counter-propagating modes, are known to flow under relevant neutral disorders into a stable Kane-Fisher-Polchinski (KFP) renormalization group (RG) fixed point, which yields a quantized two-terminal conductance $\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^2}{h}$ consistent with the experiments. Motivated by growing interests in superconducting (SC) quantum Hall systems, we study the $\nu=2/3$ FQH edge states with disordered SC proximity by generalizing the KFP analysis, which may also apply to the recently realized $\nu=2/3$ fractional Chern insulator. We show that the $\nu=2/3$ FQH edge theory has an infinite number of stable RG fixed points SC$_N$ labeled by an integer $N\in\mathbb{Z}$, each of which is driven by a relevant disordered charge-$2q_N$ SC tunneling with $q_N\in\mathbb{Z}$ depending on $N$. The $N&lt;0$ ($N\ge0$) phases are favored by an attractive (repulsive) inter-mode interaction on the edge. We further predict that the edge states in a SC$_N$ phase with $q_N\neq0$ yields a quantized downstream resistance $R_d=\frac{h}{2q_N^2e^2}$ measurable in a FQH-SC junction. For edge states staying in the KFP phase ($N=0$ and $q_N=0$) under SC proximity, we arrive at a nonlinear $R_d\propto V^{-\alpha}$ or $T^{-\alpha}$ with voltage bias $V$ or temperature $T$, where $\alpha=4$ ($\alpha=1$) if pairing (vortex tunneling) dominates.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ans\"{a}tze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors have demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Where You Place the Norm Matters: From Prejudiced to Neutral Initializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization, are central components in modern neural networks, widely adopted to improve training stability and generalization. While their practical effectiveness is well documented, a detailed theoretical understanding of how normalization affects model behavior, starting from initialization, remains an important open question. In this work, we investigate how both the presence and placement of normalization within hidden layers influence the statistical properties of network predictions before training begins. In particular, we study how these choices shape the distribution of class predictions at initialization, which can range from unbiased (Neutral) to highly concentrated (Prejudiced) toward a subset of classes. Our analysis shows that normalization placement induces systematic differences in the initial prediction behavior of neural networks, which in turn shape the dynamics of learning. By linking architectural choices to prediction statistics at initialization, our work provides a principled understanding of how normalization can influence early training behavior and offers guidance for more controlled and interpretable network design.</description>

      <title>Disentangling hierarchical relaxations in glass formers via dynamic eigenmodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical dynamics in glass-forming systems span multiple timescales, from fast vibrations to slow structural rearrangements, appearing in both supercooled fluids and glassy states. Understanding how these diverse processes interact across timescales remains a central challenge. Here, by combining direct particle-level observations with a dynamic eigenmode approach that decomposes intermediate-timescale responses into distinct modes, we reveal the microscopic organisation of relaxation dynamics in two-dimensional colloidal systems. We identify five classes of modes characterizing hierarchical dynamics: (i) quasi-elastic modes, (ii) slow-reversible string modes contributing to dynamic heterogeneity, (iii) slow-irreversible string modes leading to flow, (iv) fast-$\beta$ modes with fast-reversible strings, and (v) random noise modes. The emergence of quasi-elastic modes marks the onset of glassy dynamics, while reversible string modes dominate dynamic heterogeneity throughout both supercooled and glassy regimes. Our findings offer a unified microscopic framework for understanding how distinct relaxation processes interconnect across timescales, illuminating the mechanisms driving glass formation.</description>
