      <title>On Extremal Eigenvalues of Random Matrices with Gaussian Entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $Z_n=\xi_1A_1+\xi_2A_2+...+\xi_nA_n$ for $\xi_1,\xi_2,\hspace{0.05cm}...\hspace{0.05cm},\xi_n$ i.i.d., $\xi_1\overset{d}{=}N(0,1),$ $A_1,A_2,\hspace{0.05cm}...\hspace{0.05cm},A_n \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ deterministic and symmetric. Moment bounds on the operator norm of $Z_n$ have been obtained via a matrix version of Markov's inequality (also known as Bernstein's trick). This work approaches these quantities with the aid of Gaussian processes, namely via interpolation alongside a variational definition of extremal eigenvalues. This perspective not only recoups the aforesaid results, but also renders both bounds that reflect a more intrinsic notion of dimension for the matrices $A_1,A_2,\hspace{0.05cm}...\hspace{0.05cm},A_n$ than $d,$ and moment bounds on the smallest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of $Z_n.$</description>

      <title>Continuously Parametrised Porous Media Model and Scaling Limits of Kinetically Constrained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of non-linear diffusivity in kinetically constrained, one-dimensional symmetric exclusion processes satisfying the gradient condition. Recent developments introduced new gradient dynamics based on the Bernstein polynomial basis, enabling richer diffusive behaviours but requiring adaptations of existing techniques. In this work, we exploit these models to generalise the Porous Media Model to non-integer parameters and establish simple conditions on general kinetic constraints under which the empirical measure of a perturbed version of the process converges. This provides a robust framework for modelling non-linear diffusion from kinetically constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical relationship between CAR algebras and determinantal point processes: point processes at finite temperature and stochastically positive KMS systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we develop the author's previous work on the dynamical relationship between determinantal point processes and CAR algebras. Secondly, we present a novel application of the theory of stochastic processes associated with KMS states for CAR algebras and their quasi-free states. Lastly, we propose a unified theory of algebraic constructions and analysis of stationary processes on point configuration spaces with respect to determinantal point processes. As a byproduct, we establish an algebraic derivation of a determinantal formula for space-time correlations of stochastic processes, and we analyze several limiting behaviors of these processes.</description>

      <title>A uniform particle approximation to the Navier-Stokes-alpha models in three dimensions with advection noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a system of interacting particles governed by a set of stochastic differential equations. Our main goal is to rigorously demonstrate that the empirical measure associated with the particle system converges uniformly, both in time and space, to the solution of the three dimensional Navier Stokes alpha model with advection noise. This convergence establishes a probabilistic framework for deriving macroscopic stochastic fluid equations from underlying microscopic dynamics. The analysis leverages semigroup techniques to address the nonlinear structure of the limiting equations, and we provide a detailed treatment of the well posedness of the limiting stochastic partial differential equation. This ensures that the particle approximation remains stable and controlled over time. Although similar convergence results have been obtained in two dimensional settings, our study presents the first proof of strong uniform convergence in three dimensions for a stochastic fluid model derived from an interacting particle system. Importantly, our results also yield new insights in the deterministic regime, namely, in the absence of advection noise, where this type of convergence had not been previously established.</description>

      <title>A lattice point counting approach for the study of the number of self-avoiding walks on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reduce the problem of counting self-avoiding walks in the square lattice to a problem of counting the number of integral points in multidimensional domains. We obtain an asymptotic estimate of the number of self-avoiding walks of length $n$ in the square lattice. This new formalism gives a natural and unified setting in order to study the properties the number of self-avoidings walks in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ of any dimension $d\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Groups with pairings, Hall modules, and Hall-Littlewood polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate the combinatorics of Hall-Littlewood polynomials to that of abelian $p$-groups with alternating or Hermitian perfect pairings. Our main result is an analogue of the classical relationship between the Hall algebra of abelian $p$-groups (without pairings) and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Specifically, we define a module over the classical Hall algebra with basis indexed by groups with pairings, and explicitly relate its structure constants to Hall-Littlewood polynomials at different values of the parameter $t$.
  We also show certain expectation formulas with respect to Cohen-Lenstra type measures on groups with pairings. In the alternating case this gives a new and simpler proof of previous results of Delaunay-Jouhet.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Convergence for Sparse Ergodic Averages in $L^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a unified framework to proving pointwise convergence of sparse sequences, deterministic and random, at the $L^1(X)$ endpoint. Specifically, suppose that \[ a_n \in \{ \lfloor n^c \rfloor, \min\{ k : \sum_{j \leq k} X_j = n\} \} \] where $X_j$ are Bernoulli random variables with expectations $\mathbb{E} X_j = n^{-\alpha}$, and we restrict to $1 &lt; c &lt; 8/7, \ 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2$.
  Then (almost surely) for any measure-preserving system, $(X,\mu,T)$, and any $f \in L^1(X)$, the ergodic averages \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{a_n} f \] converge $\mu$-a.e. Moreover, our proof gives new quantitative estimates on the rate of convergence, using jump-counting/variation/oscillation technology, pioneered by Bourgain.
  This improves on previous work of Urban-Zienkiewicz, and Mirek, who established the above with $c = \frac{1001}{1000}, \ \frac{30}{29}$, respectively, and LaVictoire, who established the random result, all in a non-quantitative setting.</description>

      <title>A functional limit theorem for a dynamical system with an observable maximised on a Cantor set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider heavy-tailed observables maximised on a dynamically defined Cantor set and prove convergence of the associated point processes as well as functional limit theorems. The Cantor structure, and its connection to the dynamics, causes clustering of large observations: this is captured in the `decorations' on our point processes and functional limits, an application of the theory developed in a paper by the latter three authors.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent in Non-Convex Problems: Asymptotic Convergence with Relaxed Step-Size via Stopping Time Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning research. Previous convergence analyses of SGD under the vanishing step-size setting typically require Robbins-Monro conditions. However, in practice, a wider variety of step-size schemes are frequently employed, yet existing convergence results remain limited and often rely on strong assumptions. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel analytical framework based on a stopping-time method, enabling asymptotic convergence analysis of SGD under more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions. In the non-convex setting, we prove the almost sure convergence of SGD iterates for step-sizes $ \{ \epsilon_t \}_{t \geq 1} $ satisfying $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t = +\infty$ and $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t^p &lt; +\infty$ for some $p &gt; 2$. Compared with previous studies, our analysis eliminates the global Lipschitz continuity assumption on the loss function and relaxes the boundedness requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Building upon the almost sure convergence results, we further establish $L_2$ convergence. These significantly relaxed assumptions make our theoretical results more general, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>On Invariant Conjugate Symmetric Statistical Structures on the Space of Zero-Mean Multivariate Normal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the results of Furuhata--Inoguchi--Kobayashi [Inf. Geom. (2021)] and Kobayashi--Ohno [Osaka Math. J. (2025)], the Amari--Chentsov $\alpha$-connections on the space $\mathcal{N}$ of all $n$-variate normal distributions are uniquely characterized by the invariance under the transitive action of the affine transformation group among all conjugate symmetric statistical connections with respect to the Fisher metric. In this paper, we investigate the Amari--Chentsov $\alpha$-connections on the submanifold $\mathcal{N}_0$ consisting of zero-mean $n$-variate normal distributions. It is known that $\mathcal{N}_0$ admits a natural transitive action of the general linear group $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$-invariant conjugate symmetric statistical connections on $\mathcal{N}_0$ with respect to the Fisher metric and the space of homogeneous cubic real symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables. As a consequence, if $n \geq 2$, we show that the Amari--Chentsov $\alpha$-connections on $\mathcal{N}_0$ are not uniquely characterized by the invariance under the $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$-action among all conjugate symmetric statistical connections with respect to the Fisher metric. Furthermore, we show that any invariant statistical structure on a Riemannian symmetric space is necessarily conjugate symmetric.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behaviour of stochastic processes, with applications to supermartingale convergence, Dvoretzky's approximation theorem, and stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration. We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range of different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied. Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.</description>

Abstract: We characterize $C^*$-simplicity for countable groups by means of the following dichotomy. If a group is $C^*$-simple, then the action on the Poisson boundary is essentially free for a generic measure on the group. If a group is not $C^*$-simple, then the action on the Poisson boundary is not essentially free for a generic measure on the group.</description>

Abstract: Based on the Lie symmetry method, we investigate a Feynman-Kac formula for the classical geometric mean reversion process, which effectively describing the dynamics of short-term interest rates. The Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries and the corresponding one-parameter symmetry groups of the equation are obtained. An optimal system of invariant solutions are constructed by a derived optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras. Because of taking into account a supply response to price rises, this equation provides for a more realistic assumption than the geometric Brownian motion in many investment scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Peano curve from mated geodesic trees in the directed landscape</title>

Abstract: For the directed landscape, the putative universal space-time scaling limit object in the (1+1) dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, consider the geodesic tree -- the tree formed by the coalescing semi-infinite geodesics in a given direction. As shown in Bhatia '23, this tree comes interlocked with a dual tree, which (up to a reflection) has the same marginal law as the geodesic tree. Analogous examples of one ended planar trees formed by coalescent semi-infinite random paths and their duals are objects of interest in various other probability models, a classical example being the Brownian web, which is constructed as a scaling limit of coalescent random walks. In this paper, we continue the study of the geodesic tree and its dual in the directed landscape and exhibit a new space-filling curve traversing between the two trees that is naturally parametrized by the area it covers and encodes the geometry of the two trees; this parallels the construction of the T\'oth-Werner curve between the Brownian web and its dual. We study the regularity and fractal properties of this Peano curve, exploiting simultaneously the symmetries of the directed landscape and probabilistic estimates obtained in planar exponential last passage percolation, which is known to converge to the directed landscape in the scaling limit. On the way, we develop a novel coalescence estimate for geodesics, and this has recently found application in other work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine optimal matchings or transport between two stationary random measures. It covers allocation from the Lebesgue measure to a point process and matching a point process to a regular (shifted) lattice. The main focus of the article is the impact of hyperuniformity (reduced variance fluctuations in point processes) to optimal transport: in dimension 2, we show that the typical matching cost has finite second moment under a mild logarithmic integrability condition on the reduced pair correlation measure, showing that most planar hyperuniform point processes are L2-perturbed lattices. Our method also retrieves known sharp bounds in finite windows for neutral integrable systems such as Poisson processes, and also applies to hyperfluctuating systems. Further, in three dimensions onwards, all point processes with an integrable pair correlation measure are L2-perturbed lattices without requiring hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Heat flow in a periodically forced, unpinned thermostatted chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the hydrodynamic limit for a one-dimensional harmonic chain of interacting atoms with a random flip of the momentum sign. The system is open: at the left boundary it is attached to a heat bath at temperature $T_-$, while at the right endpoint it is subject to an action of a force which reads as $\bar F + \frac 1{\sqrt n} \widetilde{\mathcal F} (n^2 t)$, where $\bar F \ge0$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal F}(t)$ is a periodic function. Here $n$ is the size of the microscopic system. Under a diffusive scaling of space-time, we prove that the empirical profiles of the two locally conserved quantities - the volume stretch and the energy - converge, as $n\to+\infty$, to the solution of a non-linear diffusive system of conservative partial differential equations with a Dirichlet type and Neumann boundary conditions on the left and the right endpoints, respectively.</description>

      <title>A gradient model for the Bernstein polynomial basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a symmetric, gradient exclusion process within the class of non-cooperative kinetically constrained lattice gases, modelling a non-linear diffusivity in which the exchange of occupation values between two neighbouring sites depends on the local density in specific boxes surrounding the pair. The existence of such a model satisfying the gradient property is the main novelty of this work, filling a gap in the literature regarding the types of diffusivities attainable within this class of models. The resulting dynamics exhibits similarities with the Bernstein polynomial basis and generalises the Porous Media Model. We also introduce an auxiliary collection of processes, which extend the Porous Media Model in a different direction and are related to the former process via an inversion formula.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for Lyapunov exponents of Milstein approximation of stochastic differential systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milstein approximation with step size $\Delta t&gt;0$ of the solution $(X, Y)$ to a two-by-two system of linear stochastic differential equations is considered. It is proved that when the solution of the underlying model is exponentially stable or exponentially blowing up at infinite time, these behaviours are preserved at the level of the Milstein approximate solution $\{(X_n, Y_n)\}$ in both the mean-square and almost-sure senses, provided sufficiently small step size $\Delta t$. This result is based on sharp estimates, from both above and below, of the discrete Lyapunov exponent. This type of sharp estimate for approximate solutions to stochastic differential equations seems to be first studied in this work. In particular, the proposed method covers the setting for linear stochastic differential equations as well as the $\theta$-Milstein scheme's setting.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of Leray-Hopf Solutions to Forced Stochastic Hyperdissipative Navier-Stokes Equations up to Lions Index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show non-uniqueness of local strong solutions to stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations with linear multiplicative noise and some certain deterministic force. Such non-uniqueness holds true even if we perturb such deterministic force in appropriate sense.This is closely related to a critical condition on force under which Leray-Hopf solution to the stochastic equations is locally unique. Meanwhile, by a new idea, we show that for some stochastic force the system admits two different global Leray-Hopf solutions smooth on any compact subset of $(0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complex-analytic approach to the classification of stationary probability measures on $S^1$ with respect to the action of $PSU(1,1)$ on the unit circle via M\"{o}bius transformations by studying their Cauchy transforms from the perspective of generalized analytic continuation. We improve upon results of Bourgain and present a complete characterization of Furstenberg measures for Fuchsian groups of first kind via the Brown-Shields-Zeller theorem.</description>

      <title>Inferring the dependence graph density of binary graphical models in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of binary interacting chains describing the dynamics of a group of $N$ components that, at each time unit, either send some signal to the others or remain silent otherwise. The interactions among the chains are encoded by a directed Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph with unknown parameter $ p \in (0, 1) .$ Moreover, the system is structured within two populations (excitatory chains versus inhibitory ones) which are coupled via a mean field interaction on the underlying Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph. In this paper, we address the question of inferring the connectivity parameter $p$ based only on the observation of the interacting chains over $T$ time units. In our main result, we show that the connectivity parameter $p$ can be estimated with rate $N^{-1/2}+N^{1/2}/T+(\log(T)/T)^{1/2}$ through an easy-to-compute estimator. Our analysis relies on a precise study of the spatio-temporal decay of correlations of the interacting chains. This is done through the study of coalescing random walks defining a backward regeneration representation of the system. Interestingly, we also show that this backward regeneration representation allows us to perfectly sample the system of interacting chains (conditionally on each realization of the underlying Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph) from its stationary distribution. These probabilistic results have an interest in its own.</description>

      <title>Complex symmetric, self-dual, and Ginibre random matrices: Analytical results for three classes of bulk and edge statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a conjecture about the local bulk statistics of complex eigenvalues has been made based on numerics. It claims that there are only three universality classes, which have all been observed in open chaotic quantum systems. Motivated by these new insights, we compute and compare the expectation values of $k$ pairs of complex conjugate characteristic polynomials in three ensembles of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices representative for the three classes: the well-known complex Ginibre ensemble, complex symmetric and complex self-dual matrices. In the Cartan classification scheme of non-Hermitian random matrices they are labelled as class A, AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$, respectively. Using the technique of Grassmann variables, we derive explicit expressions for a single pair of expected characteristic polynomials for finite as well as infinite matrix dimension. For the latter we consider the global limit as well as zoom into the edge and the bulk of the spectrum, providing new analytical results for classes AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$. For general $k$, we derive the effective Lagrangians corresponding to the non-linear $\sigma$-models in the respective physical systems. Interestingly, they agree for all three ensembles, while the corresponding Goldstone manifolds, over which one has to perform the remaining integrations, are different and equal the three classical compact groups in the bulk. In particular, our analytical results show that these three ensembles have indeed different local bulk and edge spectral statistics, corroborating the conjecture further.</description>
