      <title>Bridging Brains and Models: MoE-Based Functional Lesions for Simulating and Rehabilitating Aphasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The striking alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human brain activity positions them as powerful models of healthy cognition. This parallel raises a fundamental question: if LLMs can model the intact brain, can we lesion them to simulate the linguistic deficits of the injured brain? In this work, we introduce a methodology to model aphasia - a complex language disorder caused by neural injury - by selectively disabling components in a modular Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model. We simulate distinct aphasia subtypes, validate their linguistic outputs against real patient speech, and then investigate functional recovery by retraining the model's remaining healthy experts. Our results demonstrate that lesioning functionally-specialized experts for syntax or semantics induces distinct impairments that closely resemble Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, respectively. Crucially, we show that freezing the damaged experts and retraining the intact ones on conversational data restores significant linguistic function, demonstrating a computational analogue for rehabilitation. These findings establish modular LLMs as a powerful and clinically-relevant potential framework for modeling the mechanisms of language disorders and for computationally exploring novel pathways for therapy.</description>

      <title>Delay-constrained re-entry governs large-scale brain seizures and other network pathologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Re-entry of travelling excitation loops is a long-suspected driver of human seizures, yet how such loops arise in patient brain networks -- and how susceptible they are to targeted disruption -- remains unclear. We reconstruct a millimetre-scale virtual brain from diffusion MRI of a drug-resistant epilepsy patient, embed excitable Epileptor neural fields, and show that realistic cortico-cortical delays are sufficient to generate self-sustaining re-entry. Systematic parameter sweeps reveal a narrow delay-coupling window that predicts oscillation frequency and seizure duration across 184 recorded seizures. Precisely timed biphasic stimuli or sub-millimetre virtual lesions abort re-entry in silico, yielding phase-dependent termination rules validated in intracranial recordings. Our framework exposes delay-constrained re-entry as a generic dynamical mechanism for large-scale brain synchrony and provides a patient-specific testbed for precision neuromodulation and minimally invasive disconnection.</description>

      <title>Covariance spectrum in nonlinear recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in simultaneous recordings of large numbers of neurons have driven significant interest in the structure of neural population activity such as dimension. A key question is how these dynamic features arise mechanistically and their relationship to circuit connectivity. It was previously proposed to use the covariance eigenvalue distribution, or spectrum, which can be analytically derived in random recurrent networks, as a robust measure to describe the shape of neural population activity beyond the dimension (Hu and Sompolinsky 2022). Applications of the theoretical spectrum have broadly found accurate matches to experimental data across brain areas providing mechanistic insights into the observed low dimensional population dynamics (Morales et al. 2023). However, the empirical success highlights a gap in theory, as the neural network model used to derive the spectrum was minimal with linear neurons. In this work, we aim to close this gap by studying the covariance spectrum in networks with nonlinear neurons and under broader dynamical regimes including chaos. Surprisingly, we found that the spectrum can be precisely understood by equations analogous to the linear theory substituted with an effective recurrent connection strength parameter, that reflects both the connection weights and the nonlinearity of neurons. Across dynamical regimes, this effective connection strength provides a unified interpretation for the spectrum and dimension changes, and stays near the critical value in the chaotic regime without fine-tuning. These results further our understanding of nonlinear neural population dynamics and provide additional theoretical support for applying the covariance spectrum analysis in biological circuits.</description>

      <title>Harmonic fractal transformation for modeling complex neuronal effects: from bursting and noise shaping to waveform sensitivity and noise-induced subthreshold spiking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the first fractal frequency mapping, which in a simple form enables to replicate complex neuronal effects. Unlike the conventional filters, which suppress or amplify the input spectral components according to the filter weights, the transformation excites novel components by a fractal recomposition of the input spectra resulting in a formation of spikes at resonant frequencies that are optimal for sampling. This enables high sensitivity detection, robustness to noise and noise-induced signal amplification. The proposed model illustrates that a neuronal functionality can be viewed as a linear summation of spectrum over nonlinearly transformed frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Kinetic energy in random recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between unstable fixed points and chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional neural dynamics remains elusive. In this work, we investigate the kinetic energy distribution of random recurrent neural networks by combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain), with a power-law behavior close to the critical point. The steady-state activity distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations on finite-size systems. This study provides a first step toward understanding the landscape of kinetic energy, which may reflect the structure of phase space for the non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>n:m Phase-Locking of Heterogeneous and Strongly Coupled Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a scalar reduction method beyond weak perturbations for forced or coupled systems to determine the existence and stability of $n{:}m$ phase-locked states. We consider various biologically relevant oscillators including the nonradial isochron clock and thalamic neural oscillators. The proposed scalar reduction successfully captures the emergence and disappearance of phase-locked states as a function of coupling strength and heterogeneity. We find that even small amounts of heterogeneity (often orders of magnitude smaller than the coupling strength) can significantly alter phase-locked states. The proposed method is a straightforward means to both reduce and analyze potentially high-dimensional systems of coupled oscillators in more biologically realistic settings.</description>
