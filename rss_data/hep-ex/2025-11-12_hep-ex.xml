      <title>Analytically Optimising Muon Diffusion Experiments with Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key challenges in performing muon experiments is knowing which temperatures and applied fields to measure at, and how many muon decays should be measured at each temperature/field combination to get the most useful dataset. We have developed a technique using Fisher information which, for a given muon asymmetry function, can analytically calculate the number of muon decays required to obtain a given error on the parameters of the asymmetry model. Here, we report on the results of our project, in particular applying our methodology to the problem of knowing the best choice of applied longitudinal fields for ionic diffusion experiments.</description>

      <title>A Method for On-Orbit Calibration of the VLAST-P Electromagnetic Calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Very Large Area Gamma-ray Space Telescope Pathfinder (VLAST-P), as the technology validation satellite for the VLAST mission, is designed to observe high-energy solar bursts on orbit. The CsI electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is one of the key sub-detectors of VLAST-P. To investigate the on-orbit energy calibration method of the ECAL, a Geant4-based simulation of VLAST-P was carried out. The results show an energy resolution better than 10% in the 0.1 to 5 GeV range and a linearity deviation below 2%. A dedicated minimum-ionization-particle (MIP) calibration method was developed to ensure accurate energy reconstruction and to monitor detector stability throughout the in-orbit calibration period.</description>

      <title>Search for new physics with charm rare decays at BESIII</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search for new physics with charm rare decays at BESIII. The BESIII experiment has collected 2.6 billion $\psi(3686)$ events, 10 billion $J/\psi$ events, $20 fb^{-1}$ D meson pairs at 3.773 GeV, and $7.33 fb^{-1}~D_{s}D_{s}^{*}$ events from 4.128 to 4.226 GeV. The huge data samples allow us to search for rare processes in charm hadron decays. In this paper, we report the FCNC decay in $J/\psi\to D^0\mu^+\mu^-$, $J/\psi\to D^0\gamma$ and $D_{s}^{+}\to h(h')e^+e^-$. The search for $J/\psi$ weak decays containing a D meson, $J/\psi\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}$, and $J/\psi\to D_{s}^{-}\rho^{+}$ will also be presented.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Particles in $K^0_L \to \gamma X$ at the KOTO Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a search for an invisible particle $X$ in the decay $K^0_L\rightarrow \gamma X$ ($X \to \text{invisible}$), where $X$ can be interpreted as a massless or massive dark photon. No evidence for $X$ was found, based on 13 candidate events consistent with a predicted background of $12.66 \pm 4.42_{\text{stat.}} \pm 2.13_{\text{syst.}}$ events. Upper limits on the branching ratio of $K^0_L\rightarrow \gamma X$ were set for the $X$ mass range $0 \leq m_X \leq 425$ MeV/$c^2$. For massless $X$, the upper limit was $3.4\times10^{-7}$ at the $90\%$ confidence level, while for massive $X$, the upper limits in the searched mass region ranged from $O(10^{-7})$ to $O(10^{-3})$.</description>

      <title>Search for long-lived particles using displaced vertices with low-momentum tracks in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for long-lived particles using final states including a displaced vertex with low-momentum tracks, large missing transverse momentum, and a jet from initial-state radiation is presented. This search uses proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2017 and 2018, with a total integrated luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$. This analysis adopts specific supersymmetric (SUSY) coannihilation scenarios as benchmark signal models, characterized by a next-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP) with a mass difference of less than 25GeV relative to the lightest SUSY particle, assumed to be a bino-like neutralino. In the top squark ($\tilde{\mathrm{t}}$) NLSP model, the NLSP is a long-lived $\tilde{\mathrm{t}}$, while in the bino-wino NLSP scenario, the mass-degenerate NLSPs are a wino-like long-lived neutralino and a short-lived chargino. The search excludes top squarks with masses less than 400$-$1100 GeV and wino-like neutralinos with masses less than 220$-$550 GeV, depending on the signal parameters, including the mass difference, mass, and lifetime of the long-lived particle. It sets the most stringent limits to date for the $\tilde{\mathrm{t}}$ and bino-wino NLSP models.</description>

      <title>Experimental road of the $J/\psi\phi$ mass spectrum, current status, and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the $X(4140)$ structure reported in the $J/\psi \phi$ system by the CDF experiment in 2009, a series of searches have been carried out in the $J/\psi \phi$ and $J/\psi K$ channels, leading to the claim of ten structures in the $B \rightarrow J/\psi \phi K$ system. This article provides a comprehensive review of experimental developments, from the initial evidence of $X(4140)$ at CDF to the amplitude analyses and diffractive process investigations by the LHCb experiment, as well as theoretical interpretations of these states. A triplet of $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$ states with relatively large mass splittings [about 200~MeV (natural units are adopted)] has been identified in the $J/\psi \phi$ system by LHCb. Their mass-squared values align approximately linearly with a possible radial quantum number, suggesting that the triplet may represent a radially excited family. For $X(4140)$, the first state in the triplet, its width reported by LHCb is inconsistent with that measured by other experiments, and possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. A potential connection between an excess at 4.35~GeV in the $J/\psi \phi$ mass spectrum reported by the Belle experiment through a two-photon process and a potential spin-2 excess in the LHCb data is also investigated. In addition, potential parallels between the $J/\psi \phi$ and $J/\psi J/\psi$ systems, both composed of two vector mesons, are discussed. The continued interest in, and complexity of, these systems underscore the necessity of further experimental exploration with increased statistical precision across a variety of experiments, particularly those with relatively flat efficiency across the Dalitz plot. The $J/\psi \omega$, $\phi \phi$, $\rho \omega$, and $\rho \phi$ systems are mentioned, and the prospects for the $J/\psi \Upsilon$ and $\Upsilon \Upsilon$ systems, are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic $\tau$ decays present an opportunity to determine the isovector part of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in a way complementary to $e^+e^-\to\text{hadrons}$ cross sections. However, the required isospin rotation is only exact in the isospin limit, and corrections need to be under control to draw robust conclusions, most notably for $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ decays to determine the two-pion contribution, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In this work, we present a novel analysis of the required radiative corrections using dispersion relations, thereby extending in a model-independent way the previous analysis in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) beyond the threshold region. In particular, we include the dominant structure-dependent virtual corrections from pion-pole diagrams, leading to sizable changes in the vicinity of the $\rho(770)$ resonance. Moreover, we work out the matching to ChPT and devise a strategy for a stable numerical evaluation of real-emission contributions near the two-pion threshold, which proves important to capture isospin-breaking corrections enhanced by the threshold singularity. For the numerical analysis, we use a dispersive representation of the pion form factor including the $\rho'$, $\rho''$ resonances, perform fits to the available data sets for the $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectral function, and calculate the corresponding radiative correction factor $G_\text{EM}(s)$ in a self-consistent manner. Based on these results, we evaluate the $\tau$-specific isospin-breaking corrections to $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.</description>

      <title>Jet quenching in out-of-equilibrium QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study of jet substructure modifications during the bottom-up evolution that describes the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. To this end, we study the bremsstrahlung radiation rate of soft gluons from a hard parton propagating through out-of-equilibrium QCD matter. The gluon spectrum is computed within the Improved Opacity Expansion, which accounts for both multiple soft and single hard momentum exchanges between the hard probe and the medium. The background evolution is obtained from effective kinetic theory simulations that determine the jet quenching parameter, which in turn controls the radiation rate. We compute the radiation rate for initially under- and over-occupied systems, as well as for an expanding system undergoing hydrodynamization, which typically represents the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions. The results for these dynamical backgrounds are compared to static and thermally matched scenarios, allowing to gauge the importance of bulk expansion in the evolution of the jet cascade. Our findings show that the early stages of the bulk matter evolution in heavy-ion collisions leave a sizable imprint on the radiation pattern inside jets. These results establish a basis for incorporating pre-equilibrium dynamics into realistic descriptions of jet quenching and hard-probe evolution.</description>

      <title>Double Bangs at IceCube as a Window to the Neutrino Mass Origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation parameters are subject to renormalization group (RG) evolution, just like all couplings and masses of Standard Model (SM) particles. Within the SM extended with three massive neutrinos, it is well known that RG running effects in the neutrino sector are small. However, the RG running of the elements of the leptonic mixing (PMNS) matrix below the electroweak symmetry breaking scale can be enhanced in the presence of light neutrinophilic new particles. In this work, using a particular low-scale neutrino mass model as an example, and by taking into account both atmospheric and astrophysical neutrino fluxes, we show that RG running of the PMNS matrix can lead to an increased number of high-energy tau neutrino events at IceCube. This excess manifests as an increased number of spatially displaced showers called ``double bangs". We find that the number of double bangs induced by new physics through RG effects can be comparable to that arising from SM interactions of astrophysical tau neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Prompt diphoton production at ATLAS 13 TeV in $k_t$-factorization: a comparative analysis of UPDF models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an in-depth comparative analysis of unintegrated parton distribution function (UPDF) models for isolated prompt diphoton production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV within the $k_t$-factorization framework. Predictions are obtained with three UPDF approaches: Parton Branching (PB), NLO-MRW, and Modified KMRW (MKMRW). Tre--level $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma$, $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma + g$, and $q + g\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma + q$ subprocesses are generated with \textsc{KaTie} using off-shell initial states; the loop-induced $g + g\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma$ channel is evaluated independently. We compare differential cross sections with ATLAS measurements across a broad set of observables, including the photon transverse momenta, diphoton invariant mass and transverse momentum, the Collins-Soper angle, acoplanarity, $\phi^*_\eta$, and a transverse thrust-related variable. This comparative study quantifies the impact of the UPDF choice on the diphoton spectra. We find that the PB model provides the most consistent agreement over all distributions, whereas NLO-MRW tends to overshoot in regions correlated with larger factorization scales and MKMRW generally undershoots due to stronger Sudakov suppression. With standard scale variations, our results indicate that $k_t$-factorization with PB UPDFs can accurately describe diphoton production, while fixed-order collinear predictions typically require higher-order corrections together with parton-shower effects to achieve a comparable description.</description>

      <title>Parametrisation and dictionary for CP violating Higgs boson interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for charge-parity (CP) violating interactions of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson are a key priority of the LHC physics program. Experimental results from ATLAS and CMS are often reinterpreted within a variety of theoretical parametrisations, the most commonly used being the Higgs basis, $\kappa$'s and angles, CP fractions and effective field theories (EFT) such as the SMEFT and the Higgs EFT. However, differing conventions and assumptions across the literature make the translation between these parametrisations nontrivial and prone to inconsistencies. In this paper, we provide a unified framework and construct explicit dictionaries connecting these different approaches. This facilitates a transparent comparison between theoretical studies and experimental analyses, enabling more robust interpretations of CP-violating effects in Higgs boson interactions.</description>

      <title>Novel bounds on neutrino portal dark matter from leptonic meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of leptonic meson decays $M \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell$, where $M$ is a pseudo-scalar meson, as a probe of neutrino portal dark matter. The model of our focus features a neutral fermion $\psi$ and scalar $\phi$, which are coupled predominantly to neutrinos in the form ${\cal L} \supset \lambda\,\overline\nu_L\,\phi\,\psi_R$. This interaction generates two corrections to the $M \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell$ observables. The first one is a novel three-body decay process $M \to \ell \bar\psi\phi$. This process is enabled by the splitting of the off-shell anti-neutrino $\bar\nu_\ell$ into $\psi$ and $\phi$ in the $M \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell$ diagram. The helicity suppression in $M \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell$ is absent in the three-body process, thereby forming a potentially large contribution to real experimental results, provided $\psi$ and $\phi$ are invisible. The second one is one-loop radiative corrections to the weak vertex $W\ell \bar\nu_\ell$, which do not modify the charged lepton spectrum but lead to enhancement or suppression of the partial $M \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell$ decay width. To demonstrate the ability of the leptonic meson decays to probe the neutrino portal dark matter, we compute two corrections analytically and compare the modified meson branching ratios with the experimental data on the lepton flavor universality of pion and Kaon decays. The resulting constraints turn out to surpass the existing bounds in a large part of parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Future Collider Perspectives on Higgs CP Violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for new sources of CP violation is a cornerstone of the beyond the Standard Model phenomenology programme at the LHC and beyond. We provide a comprehensive analysis of such searches at a range of future facilities with the aim of informing the currently unfolding future collider roadmap. Focussing on new sources of CP violation specifically in the gauge-Higgs sector, we demonstrate the outstanding potential held by future electron-positron and proton-proton colliders to reveal and identify BSM physics with direct relevance for the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. In particular, the future colliders will provide an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to anomalous CP-violating interactions induced by dimension-six effective field theory operators when compared to the high-luminosity LHC programme.</description>

      <title>Design and Expected Performance for an hKLM at the EIC</title>

Abstract: We describe the design concept and estimated performance of an iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter for the future Electron Ion Collider. The novel aspect of this detector is a multi-dimensional readout coupled with foreseen excellent time resolution, enabling time-of-flight capabilities as well as a more compact overall assembly. Machine Learning is used to optimize the detector design, and the highly segmented readout is implemented with Machine Learning algorithms in mind to reach performance levels usually reserved for more complex detector systems. The primary physics objective is to serve as a muon detector/ID system at the EIC as well as provide for the identification and momentum measurement of neutral hadrons. At the EIC, these are mainly $K_L$'s and neutrons: for lower energies, excellent relative momentum measurements of a few 10\% are achieved using time-of-flight, while for higher particle momenta, the energy can be measured calorimetrically with a resolution significantly better than has been demonstrated for similar calorimeters that are read out with less granularity.</description>

      <title>Observation of Charmonium $h_{c}$ Radiative Decays to Multiple Light Hadrons and the Tensor State $f_2(1270)$</title>

Abstract: Using $\psi(3686)\rightarrow \pi^{0} h_{c}$ decays from a data sample of $(27.12\pm0.14)\times10^{8}$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected by the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, $h_c$ radiative decays to $\gamma\pi^{+}\pi^{-},~\gamma\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\eta,~\gamma2(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})$, and $\gamma p\bar{p}$ are observed for the first time, each with a significance greater than $5\sigma$. The corresponding branching fractions are measured. Furthermore, intermediate states below 2.8 GeV/$c^{2}$ are investigated, leading to the first observation of the decay process of $h_c\rightarrow\gamma f_{2}(1270)\rightarrow\gamma\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ with a significance of $5.5\,\sigma$. This observation represents the first instance of $h_c$ radiative decay to a tensor state.</description>

      <title>NuGraph2 with Context-Aware Inputs: Physics-Inspired Improvements in Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have recently shown strong promise for event reconstruction tasks in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers, yet their performance remains limited for underrepresented classes of particles, such as Michel electrons. In this work, we investigate physics-informed strategies to improve semantic segmentation within the NuGraph2 architecture. We explore three complementary approaches: (i) enriching the input representation with context-aware features derived from detector geometry and track continuity, (ii) introducing auxiliary decoders to capture class-level correlations, and (iii) incorporating energy-based regularization terms motivated by Michel electron energy distributions. Experiments on MicroBooNE public datasets show that physics-inspired feature augmentation yields the largest gains, particularly boosting Michel electron precision and recall by disentangling overlapping latent space regions. In contrast, auxiliary decoders and energy-regularization terms provided limited improvements, partly due to the hit-level nature of NuGraph2, which lacks explicit particle- or event-level representations. Our findings highlight that embedding physics context directly into node-level inputs is more effective than imposing task-specific auxiliary losses, and suggest that future hierarchical architectures such as NuGraph3, with explicit particle- and event-level reasoning, will provide a more natural setting for advanced decoders and physics-based regularization. The code for this work is publicly available on Github at https://github.com/vitorgrizzi/nugraph_phys/tree/main_phys.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanical systems have recently been proposed as detectors for ultralight dark matter, leveraging their ability to cool and probe mechanical oscillators at the quantum limit. Here we present a resonant search for ultralight dark matter using a cavity optomechanical accelerometer. The detector consists of a cryogenic Si$_3$N$_4$-membrane cavity mounted to a 4 K copper plate, with photothermal tuning used to scan its 39 kHz mechanical resonance. Shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation-pressure feedback cooling yield an acceleration sensitivity of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over 30 Hz near resonance. The detector's material inhomogeneity gives access to direct vector coupling to the dark-matter field. We conduct a Bayesian search based on matched-filter statistics, yielding upper bounds consistent with thermal noise and above those set by equivalence principle tests. No signal is observed, but the experiment demonstrates stable, quantum-limited operation and validates a scalable approach to resonant detection. With optimized test masses, lower temperature, and multiplexed arrays, the platform offers a path toward competitive constraints on vector-mediated dark-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Impact of new invisible particles on $B\to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent Belle~II measurement that suggests an excess in the rare decay $B \to K\, E_{\rm miss}$, and building upon our recent differential decay rate likelihood analysis of the existing experimental information, we investigate possible new physics (NP) scenarios in which light invisible states participate in flavour-changing $b \to s$ transitions. In particular, we consider the total and differential $B\to K^* E_{\rm miss}$ decay rates and $K^*$ polarisation effects in each NP scenario preferred by the $B\to K E_{\rm miss}$ measurement. We show that future measurements of these $B \to K^* E_{\rm miss}$ observables will offer decisive discrimination among the different NP explanations. Our results highlight the strong complementarity of the rare semi-invisible $b$-hadron decay observables, and underline the importance of analysing their momentum transfer spectra when probing extensions of the Standard Model that feature new light degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A prototype reactor-antineutrino detector based on $^6$Li-doped pulse-shaping-discriminating plastic scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An aboveground 60-kg reactor-antineutrino detector prototype, comprised of a 2-dimensional array of 36 $^{6}$Li-doped pulse shape sensitive plastic scintillator bars, is described. Each bar is 50~cm long with a square cross section of 5.5~cm. Doped with $^{6}$Li at 0.1\% by mass, the detector is capable of identifying correlated energy depositions for the detection of reactor antineutrinos via the inverse-beta-decay reaction. Each bar is wrapped with a specular reflector that directs photons towards PMTs mounted at both ends of the bar. This paper highlights the construction, key features, and main performance characteristics of the system. The system, which relies on multiple observables such as PSD, energy, position, and timing, is capable of detecting IBD-like neutron-correlated backgrounds, long-lived decay chains, and cosmogenic isotopes.</description>

      <title>Unraveling $K(1690)$ as a pseudoscalar $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observed $K (1690)$ has been identified as a supernumerary pseudoscalar resonance signal in the strange-meson spectrum predicted by quark model calculations. It is the best candidate of a strange crypto-exotic state. In this work, we systematically study the hadron masses of $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark states with $J^P = 0^-$ in the method of QCD sum rules (QCDSR). For ten interpolating currents, we calculate the correlation functions up to dimension-8 nonperturbative condensates. To calculate the tri-gluon condensate, we comprehensively consider the contributions from different operators with and without covariant derivatives. The infrared (IR) safety can be guaranteed for the completely calculated tri-gluon condensate by properly addressing the IR divergences in Feynman diagrams. It is demonstrated that the tri-gluon condensate provides significant contributions to the sum-rule analyses in these light tetraquark systems. Our results support the interpretation of $K (1690)$ resonance to be a pseudoscalar $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state.</description>

      <title>No Hiding in the Dark: Cosmological Bounds on Heavy Neutral Leptons with Dark Decay Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are well-motivated new physics candidates. The mixing of sub-GeV HNLs with active neutrinos is severely constrained by cosmology. In particular, the success of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) requires the HNL lifetime to be shorter than about 0.02 sec if they were in thermal equilibrium, thus excluding a wide range of mixing angles accessible to terrestrial experiments. In order to justify the laboratory searches in this cosmologically-forbidden region, it is often argued that adding new dark sector decay modes of HNLs can evade the stringent BBN constraint. Here we rule out this possibility and show that, contrary to the naive expectation, HNLs with significant dark decay modes actually lead to stronger cosmological bounds. This is mainly because of the increase in the extra radiation energy density in the Universe around the BBN epoch, which causes observable effects in the primordial helium fraction and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Our result has major implications for laboratory searches of HNLs.</description>

      <title>Branching ratios and CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ in the improved perturbative QCD formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea of fragmented scalar glueball, we investigate the decays $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ within the improved perturbative QCD (iPQCD) framework by including the known next-to-leading order corrections. Here, $B^0$ and $f_0$ denote the neutral $B_{d,s}^0$ mesons and the light scalar mesons $f_0(500, 980, 1370, 1500)$ under the $q\bar q$ assignment. The CP-averaged branching ratios (BRs) and the CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ are evaluated with the $f_0(500)[f_0(1370)]-f_0(980)[f_0(1500)]$ mixing in quark-flavor basis. For effective comparisons with the near-future measurements, we further derive the $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0 (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ BRs under the narrow-width approximation. ${\rm BR}(B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(980) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-))= (2.87^{+1.38}_{-1.29}) \times 10^{-4}$ and ${\rm BR}(B_d^0 \to \eta_c f_0(500)(\to \pi^+\pi^-))/{\rm BR}(B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(980)(\to \pi^+\pi^-)) = (12^{+8}_{-7})\%$ obtained in the iPQCD formalism agree with the available measurements and/or predictions within uncertainties. Large BRs of $B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1500) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ and large direct CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1370, 1500)$ are accessible in the LHCb and Belle-II experiments. The experimental tests of these iPQCD predictions would help us to understand the nature of these light scalars more deeply and provide evidences to decipher $f_0(1500)$ as a primary or fragmented scalar glueball potentially.</description>

      <title>Radiative Correction from Secret Neutrino Interactions and Implications for Neutrino-Scattering Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15023</link>

Abstract: New, neutrinophilic mediators are one potential extension beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Often, studies of neutrinophilic mediator consist of searching for direct evidence of its production and/or its tree-level virtual effect for generating strong neutrino self-interaction. In this work, we focus instead on the fact that such new mediators \textit{also} lead to deviations in neutrino-matter scattering via radiative corrections. With a mediator mass well below the electroweak scale, these effects are potentially observable in a variety of contexts, including coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), neutrino deeply-inelastic scattering ($\nu$DIS), and neutrino-electron scattering (e.g., at Borexino). Additionally, such effects lead to new contributions to the $Z$-boson decay width and to non-standard neutrino interactions relevant for long-baseline oscillation experiments. We explore all of these scenarios in some depth, building on the rich phenomenology associated with neutrinophilic mediators.</description>

      <title>Charged-Current Elastic Scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the measurement of the charged-current elastic scattering process $e^-p\rightarrow\nu_e n$ at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). This process provides sensitivity to the poorly constrained axial form factor of the nucleon, which encodes the spatial distribution of weak charge. Collisions of electrons with polarized protons enable measuring the axial form factor via the $e^{-\!}\,\vec{p} \to \nu_e\,n$ target-spin asymmetry for the first time. We conclude that a measurement of charged-current elastic scattering at the EIC will, perhaps unsurprisingly, prove very challenging. However, with dedicated instrumentation at a second EIC detector, the measurement may be possible.</description>
