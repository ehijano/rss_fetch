      <title>Antigen-Specific Antibody Design via Direct Energy-based Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibody design, a crucial task with significant implications across various disciplines such as therapeutics and biology, presents considerable challenges due to its intricate nature. In this paper, we tackle antigen-specific antibody design as a protein sequence-structure co-design problem, considering both rationality and functionality. Leveraging a pre-trained conditional diffusion model that jointly models sequences and structures of complementarity-determining regions (CDR) in antibodies with equivariant neural networks, we propose direct energy-based preference optimization to guide the generation of antibodies with both rational structures and considerable binding affinities to given antigens. Our method involves fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion model using a residue-level decomposed energy preference. Additionally, we employ gradient surgery to address conflicts between various types of energy, such as attraction and repulsion. Experiments on RAbD benchmark show that our approach effectively optimizes the energy of generated antibodies and achieves state-of-the-art performance in designing high-quality antibodies with low total energy and high binding affinity, demonstrating the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>Isoleucine gate blocks K+ conduction in C-type inactivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels display a time-dependent phenomenon called C-type inactivation, whereby prolonged activation by voltage leads to the inhibition of ionic conduction, a process that involves a conformational change at the selectivity filter toward a non-conductive state. Recently, a high-resolution structure of a strongly inactivating triple-mutant channel kv1.2-kv2.1-3m revealed a novel conformation of the selectivity filter that is dilated at its outer end, distinct from the well-characterized conductive state. While the experimental structure was interpreted as the elusive non-conductive state, molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiology measurements demonstrate that the dilated filter of kv1.2-kv2.1-3m, however, is conductive and, as such, cannot completely account for the inactivation of the channel observed in functional experiments. An additional conformational change implicating isoleucine residues at position 398 along the pore lining segment S6 is required to effectively block ion conduction. It is shown that the I398 residues from the four subunits act as a state-dependent hydrophobic gate located immediately beneath the selectivity filter. As a critical piece of the C-type inactivation machinery, this structural feature is the potential target of a broad class of QA blockers and negatively charged activators thus opening new research directions towards the development of drugs that specifically modulate gating-states of Kv channels.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic approaches for studies of site-specific DNA base and backbone "breathing" using exciton-coupled dimer-labeled DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA regulation and repair processes require direct interactions between proteins and DNA at specific sites. Local fluctuations of the sugar-phosphate backbones and bases of DNA (a form of DNA "breathing") play a central role in such processes. Here we review the development and application of novel spectroscopic methods and analyses - both at the ensemble and single-molecule levels - to study structural and dynamic properties of exciton-coupled cyanine and fluorescent nucleobase analogue dimer-labeled DNA constructs at key positions involved in protein-DNA complex assembly and function. The exciton-coupled dimer probes act as "sensors" of the local conformations adopted by the sugar-phosphate backbones and bases immediately surrounding the dimer probes. These methods can be used to study the mechanisms of protein binding and function at these sites.</description>

      <title>Emergent time scales of epistasis in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven epistatic model of protein evolution, capable of generating evolutionary trajectories spanning very different time scales reaching from individual mutations to diverged homologs. Our in silico evolution encompasses random nucleotide mutations, insertions and deletions, and models selection using a fitness landscape, which is inferred via a generative probabilistic model for protein families. We show that the proposed framework accurately reproduces the sequence statistics of both short-time (experimental) and long-time (natural) protein evolution, suggesting applicability also to relatively data-poor intermediate evolutionary time scales, which are currently inaccessible to evolution experiments. Our model uncovers a highly collective nature of epistasis, gradually changing the fitness effect of mutations in a diverging sequence context, rather than acting via strong interactions between individual mutations. This collective nature triggers the emergence of a long evolutionary time scale, separating fast mutational processes inside a given sequence context, from the slow evolution of the context itself. The model quantitatively reproduces the extent of contingency and entrenchment, as well as the loss of predictability in protein evolution observed in deep mutational scanning experiments of distant homologs. It thereby deepens our understanding of the interplay between mutation and selection in shaping protein diversity and novel functions, allows to statistically forecast evolution, and challenges the prevailing independent-site models of protein evolution, which are unable to capture the fundamental importance of epistasis.</description>
