      <title>The Riemann Hypothesis: Past, Present and a Letter Through Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper, commissioned as a survey of the Riemann Hypothesis, provides a comprehensive overview of 165 years of mathematical approaches to this fundamental problem, while introducing a new perspective that emerged during its preparation. The paper begins with a detailed description of what we know about the Riemann zeta function and its zeros, followed by an extensive survey of mathematical theories developed in pursuit of RH -- from classical analytic approaches to modern geometric and physical methods. We also discuss several equivalent formulations of the hypothesis. Within this survey framework, we present an original contribution in the form of a "Letter to Riemann," using only mathematics available in his time. This letter reveals a method inspired by Riemann's own approach to the conformal mapping theorem: by extremizing a quadratic form (restriction of Weil's quadratic form in modern language), we obtain remarkable approximations to the zeros of zeta. Using only primes less than 13, this optimization procedure yields approximations to the first 50 zeros with accuracies ranging from $2.6 \times 10^{-55}$ to $10^{-3}$. Moreover we prove a general result that these approximating values lie exactly on the critical line. Following the letter, we explain the underlying mathematics in modern terms, including the description of a deep connection of the Weil quadratic form with the world of information theory. The final sections develop a geometric perspective using trace formulas, outlining a potential proof strategy based on establishing convergence of zeros from finite to infinite Euler products. While completing the commissioned survey, these new results suggest a promising direction for future research on Riemann's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ that are Generalized Arithmetic Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a multiplicative subgroup $A_k$ of $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ is a generalized arithmetic progression if and only if $|A_k| = 2,\ 4,$ or $p-1$. Much of the argument is built upon recent work studying additive decompositions of subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$, and we generalize a result of Hanson and Petridis to show that any additive $n$-decomposition of a subgroup must be a direct sum.</description>

      <title>Artin twists of Drinfeld modules and Goss L-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted $L$-functions by Dirichlet characters offer deep insights into arithmetic geometry, especially in the study of elliptic curves and abelian varieties over number fields. In the function field setting, Drinfeld modules and Anderson modules serve as analogues of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, and Goss $L$-series play the role of Hasse-Weil $L$-functions. This paper introduces a motivic framework for studying twisted Goss $L$-series via Anderson motives associated to Drinfeld modules and Artin representations.
  For a Drinfeld module and an Artin representation on the absolute Galois group, we present a construction of Anderson motives associated to them and we show that it comes from a uniformizable abelian Anderson module. We also study their associated $L$-series, which recover the norm of the twisted Goss $L$-values. These results provide an interpretation of twisted Goss $L$-values in terms of regulators of Anderson modules with the help of Taelman's class number formula.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's tenth problem for finitely generated rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This expository article covers the recent developments surrounding Hilbert's tenth problem for finitely generated rings. We start by recounting the history of Hilbert's tenth problem over the integers, which was resolved negatively by Matiyasevich--Robinson--Davis--Putnam in 1970. In order to pass from $\mathbb{Z}$ to the finitely generated setting, we explain a criterion of Poonen that connects this to a problem in the theory of elliptic curves. Finally, we outline the main ideas behind the recent resolution of this elliptic curve problem by the authors.</description>

      <title>On cyclically covering subspaces of $\mathbb{F}^n_q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime power \( q \) and a positive integer \( n \), a subspace \( U \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n \) is called cyclically covering if the union of all its cyclic shifts covers the whole space \( \mathbb{F}_q^n \). Let \( h_q(n) \) denote the maximum possible codimension of such a subspace. This paper focuses on the case \( h_q(n) = 0 \). We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which \( h_q(n) = 0 \) holds. As an application, we show that \( h_q(\ell^t) = 0 \) whenever \( q \) is a primitive root modulo \( \ell^t \). Moreover, we prove that if \( n \) is odd and \( h_q(n) = 0 \), then also \( h_q(2n) = 0 \). As an example, we show that \( h_3(11) =h_3(16) = 1 \). Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the coverings of \(\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n\) and \(\mathbb{F}_q^{mn}\), and obtain several sufficient conditions for \(h_{q^m}(n) = 0\). Specifically, we derive that if \(n = 3\) or \(n = 2^d\) (where \(d\) is a nonnegative integer), then \(h_4(n) = 0\).</description>

      <title>On the density of rational lines on diagonal cubic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the asymptotic estimates for the rational lines on diagonal cubic hypersurfaces defined by $\sum_{i=1}^sc_ix^3_i=0$ with $c_i\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus \{0\},$ provided that $s\geq 19.$ This improves the previously known bound $s\geq 21$ required to obtain such asymptotic estimates. Our approach develops a multidimensional shifting variables argument together with a pruning argument, and exploits the recent progress on the Parsell-Vinogradov system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an almost minimal R=T theorem for self-dual Galois representations with coefficients in a finite field satisfying a property called rigid. We also prove the rigidity property for a large family of residual Galois representations attached to regular algebraic self-dual representations. Our theorem is based on a Taylor--Wiles patching argument for G-valued Galois representation, where G equals GO(2m) or GSp(2m).</description>

      <title>Multivariate and quantitative Erd\H{o}s-Kac laws for Beatty sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem states that for $n$ chosen uniformly at random from $1, \dots, N$, the random variable $(\omega(n) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ converges in distribution to the standard Gaussian as $N$ tends to infinity. Banks and Shparlinski showed that this Gaussian convergence holds for any Beatty sequence $\lfloor\alpha n + \beta\rfloor$ in place of $n$. Continuing in this spirit, Crn\v{c}evi\'c, Hern\'andez, Rizk, Sereesuchart and Tao considered the joint distribution of $\omega(n)$ and $\omega(\lfloor\alpha n\rfloor)$, which they showed to be asymptotically independent for irrational values of $\alpha$.
  Generalising both results, we show that for any positive integer $k$, real numbers $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k &gt; 0$ and $\beta_1, \dots, \beta_k$, where $\alpha_i/\alpha_j$ is irrational for $i\neq j$, the joint distribution of $(\omega(\lfloor\alpha_in + \beta_i\rfloor) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ converges to the $k$-dimensional standard Gaussian.
  We next discuss quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence which do not depend on the values taken by the relevant parameters. Banks and Shparlinski remarked that such quantitative bounds may be given for a single Beatty sequence $\lfloor\alpha n + \beta\rfloor$ under Diophantine type assumptions on $\alpha$. We show that such assumptions are in fact unnecessary. Specifically, for any real numbers $\alpha &gt; 0, \beta$, we show that the Kolmogorov distance between the random variable $(\omega(\lfloor\alpha n + \beta\rfloor) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ and the standard Gaussian is bounded above by $O(\log\log\log N/\sqrt{\log\log N})$ as $N$ tends to infinity.
  On the other hand, we show that universal quantitative bounds of this kind do not exist for higher-degree generalised polynomials or for the joint convergence for multiple Beatty sequences.</description>

      <title>Steganographic information hiding via symmetric numerical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a steganographic information hiding scheme based on structural properties of numerical semigroups arising from the Frobenius coin problem. Instead of encoding data through representable integers, the proposed protocol embeds information into the gap structure of carefully chosen symmetric numerical semigroups. Symmetry guarantees a balanced gap density, ensuring that encoded values are statistically indistinguishable from uniform numerical noise to an observer lacking the private generating set. The security of the scheme relies on the assumed average-case hardness of numerical semigroup membership inference for hidden generators, offering a novel number-theoretic primitive for covert communication and post-quantum resilient information hiding.</description>

      <title>On a Rankin-Selberg integral of three Hermitian cusp forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K = \mathbb{Q}(i)$. We study the Petersson inner product of a Hermitian Eisenstein series of Siegel type on the unitary group $U_{5}(K)$, diagonally-restricted on $U_2(K)\times U_2(K)\times U_1(K)$, against two Hermitian cuspidal eigenforms $F, G$ of degree $2$ and an elliptic cuspidal eigenform $h$ (seen as a Hermitian modular form of degree 1), all having weight $k \equiv 0 \pmod 4$. We obtain, through this consideration, an integral representation of a certain Dirichlet series, together with an additional residue term. By taking $F$ to belong in the Maass space, we are able to show that the Dirichlet series possesses an Euler product. Moreover, its $p$-factor for an inert prime $p$ can be essentially identified with the twist by $h$ of a degree six Euler factor attached to $G$ by Gritsenko. The question of whether the same holds for the primes that split remains unanswered here, even though we make considerable steps in that direction too. Our paper is inspired by a work of Heim, who considered a similar question in the case of Siegel modular forms.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Kloosterman sum $\text{Kl}(1,q)$ changes sign infinitely many times, as $q\rightarrow +\infty$ with at most six prime factors. As a consequence, our result improved the best known result of Xi(IMRN, 2022). The novelty of our method comes from introducing a new truncated divisor function whose selection depends on the number of prime factors of the variable, through which Kloosterman sum is controlled good enough. Our arguments contain the Selberg sieve method, spectral theory and distribution of Kloosterman sums along with previous nice works by Fouvry, Matom\"{a}ki, Michel, Sivak-Fischler and Xi.</description>

Abstract: We consider a local average in the hyperbolic lattice point counting problem for the Picard group $\Gamma$ acting on the three-dimensional hyperbolic space. Compared to the pointwise case, we improve the bounds on the remainder in the counting, conditionally on a quantum variance estimate for Maass cusp forms attached to $\Gamma$. We also use bounds on a spectral exponential sum over the Laplace eigenvalues for $\Gamma$, which has been studied in the context of the prime geodesic theorem and for which unconditional bounds are known.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we study the distribution of the rational canonical form of a random matrix over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, whose entries are independent and $\epsilon$-balanced with $\epsilon\in(0,1-1/p]$. We show that, as the matrix size tends to infinity, the statistics converge to independent Cohen-Lenstra distributions, demonstrating the universality of this asymptotic behavior. In particular, we recover, as a special case, the uniform setting proved by Fulman in his thesis in 1997.
  Our proof uses the fact that the rational canonical form data of $A_n$ and the $\mathbb{F}_p[t]$-module structure of the function field cokernel $\Cok(tI_n-A_n)$ determine each other uniquely. Consequently, our question can be reformulated, equivalently, as the asymptotic distribution problem for this cokernel, which has been established by Cheong-Yu (arXiv:2303.09125).</description>

Abstract: For $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, let $$G_{\alpha}:= \left&lt; \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ \alpha &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \right&gt; &lt; \mathrm{SL}_2 (\mathbb{R}).$$
  K. Kim and the first author established the orbit test, which provides a sufficient condition for $G_{\alpha}$ not to be a rank-$2$ free group. In this article, we present two main applications of the orbit test. First, using the corresponding modulo homomorphism, we show that the converse of the orbit test does not hold. In particular, we construct explicit counterexamples, all of which are rational. As another application, we construct sequences of non-free rational numbers converging to $3$. These sequences are given by $$ 3 + \frac{3}{2 (9 n - 1)} \quad \text{and} \quad 3 + \frac{9 n + 5}{3 (2 n + 1) (9 n + 4)},$$ and their construction relies on the orbit test together with a modified Pell's equation.</description>
