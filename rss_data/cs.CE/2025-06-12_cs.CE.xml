      <title>Exploring EEG Responses during Observation of Actions Performed by Human Actor and Humanoid Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Action observation (AO) therapy is a promising rehabilitative treatment for motor and language function in individuals recovering from neurological conditions, such as stroke. This pilot study aimed to investigate the potential of humanoid robots to support AO therapy in rehabilitation settings. The brain activity of three healthy right-handed participants was monitored with electroencephalography (EEG) while they observed eight different actions performed by two agents, a human actor and a robot, using their left and right arms. Their event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs, changes in the spectral power of neural oscillations in response to an event or stimulus, compared to baseline) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed. The single-subject analysis showed variability in ERSP patterns among all participants, including power suppression in sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. One participant showed stronger responses to "robot" AO conditions than to "human" conditions. Strong and positive correlations in ERSP across all conditions were observed for almost all participants and channels, implying common cognitive processes or neural networks at play in the mirror neuron system during AO. The results support the feasibility of using EEG to explore differences in neural responses to observation of robot- and human-induced actions.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and flexible non-intrusive reduced-order models using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an interpretable, non-intrusive reduced-order modeling technique using regularized kernel interpolation. Existing non-intrusive approaches approximate the dynamics of a reduced-order model (ROM) by solving a data-driven least-squares regression problem for low-dimensional matrix operators. Our approach instead leverages regularized kernel interpolation, which yields an optimal approximation of the ROM dynamics from a user-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that our kernel-based approach can produce interpretable ROMs whose structure mirrors full-order model structure by embedding judiciously chosen feature maps into the kernel. The approach is flexible and allows a combination of informed structure through feature maps and closure terms via more general nonlinear terms in the kernel. We also derive a computable a posteriori error bound that combines standard error estimates for intrusive projection-based ROMs and kernel interpolants. The approach is demonstrated in several numerical experiments that include comparisons to operator inference using both proper orthogonal decomposition and quadratic manifold dimension reduction.</description>

      <title>PDESpectralRefiner: Achieving More Accurate Long Rollouts with Spectral Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating accurate and stable long rollouts is a notorious challenge for time-dependent PDEs (Partial Differential Equations). Recently, motivated by the importance of high-frequency accuracy, a refiner model called PDERefiner utilizes diffusion models to refine outputs for every time step, since the denoising process could increase the correctness of modeling high frequency part. For 1-D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, refiner models can degrade the amplitude of high frequency part better than not doing refinement process. However, for some other cases, the spectrum might be more complicated. For example, for a harder PDE like Navior-Stokes equation, diffusion models could over-degrade the higher frequency part. This motivates us to release the constraint that each frequency weighs the same. We enhance our refiner model with doing adjustments on spectral space, which recovers Blurring diffusion models. We developed a new v-prediction technique for Blurring diffusion models, recovering the MSE training objective on the first refinement step. We show that in this case, for different model backbones, such as U-Net and neural operators, the outputs of PDE-SpectralRefiner are more accurate for both one-step MSE loss and rollout loss.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Discretized Boundary Integral Operators in 3D: a High-Frequency Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When modeling propagation and scattering phenomena using integral equations discretized by the boundary element method, it is common practice to approximate the boundary of the scatterer with a mesh comprising elements of size approximately equal to a fraction of the wavelength $\lambda$ of the incident wave, e.g., $\lambda/10$. In this work, by analyzing the spectra of the operator matrices, we show a discrepancy with respect to the continuous operators which grows with the simulation frequency, challenging the common belief that the aforementioned widely used discretization approach is sufficient to maintain the accuracy of the solution constant when increasing the frequency.</description>

      <title>QuantMCP: Grounding Large Language Models in Verifiable Financial Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing financial analysis and decision-making, yet their direct application is often hampered by issues of data hallucination and lack of access to real-time, verifiable financial information. This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array of Python-accessible financial data APIs (e.g., Wind, yfinance). Users can interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data, thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible, and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM applications in finance.</description>

      <title>CheMatAgent: Enhancing LLMs for Chemistry and Materials Science through Tree-Search Based Tool Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an LLM-based agent that synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from basic information retrieval to complex reaction predictions, and a dataset curation pipeline to generate the dataset ChemToolBench that facilitates both effective tool selection and precise parameter filling during fine-tuning and evaluation. We introduce a Hierarchical Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (HE-MCTS) framework, enabling independent optimization of tool planning and execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks, offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for advanced chemical applications.
