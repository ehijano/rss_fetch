      <title>Strategic Informed Trading and the Value of Private Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a market of risky financial assets whose participants are an informed trader, a representative uninformed trader, and noisy liquidity providers. We prove the existence of a market-clearing equilibrium when the insider internalizes her power to impact prices, but the uninformed trader takes prices as given. Compared to the associated competitive economy, in equilibrium the insider strategically reveals a noisier signal, and prices are less reactive to publicly available information. Additionally, and in direct contrast to the related literature, in equilibrium the insider's indirect utility monotonically increases in the signal precision. Therefore, the insider is motivated not only to obtain, but also to refine, her signal. Lastly, we show that compared to the competitive economy, the insider's internalization of price impact is utility improving for the uninformed trader, but somewhat surprisingly may be utility decreasing for the insider herself. This utility reduction occurs provided the insider is sufficiently risk averse compared to the uninformed trader, and provided the signal is of sufficiently low quality.</description>

      <title>Mean field equilibrium asset pricing model under partial observation: An exponential quadratic Gaussian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an asset pricing model in a partially observable market with a large number of heterogeneous agents using the mean field game theory. In this model, we assume that investors can only observe stock prices and must infer the risk premium from these observations when determining trading strategies. We characterize the equilibrium risk premium in such a market through a solution to the mean field backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). Specifically, the solution to the mean field BSDE can be expressed semi-analytically by employing an exponential quadratic Gaussian framework. We then construct the risk premium process, which cannot be observed directly by investors, endogenously using the Kalman-Bucy filtering theory. In addition, we include a simple numerical simulation to visualize the dynamics of our market model.</description>
