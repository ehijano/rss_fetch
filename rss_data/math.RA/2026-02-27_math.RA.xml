      <title>A Homogeneous Nullstellensatz for Joint Invariant Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jurij Vol\v{c}i\v{c} conjectured that a noncommutative polynomial $g$ belongs to the unital $\mathbb{K}$-algebra generated by finitely many noncommutative polynomials if and only if, for matrices of every size, every joint invariant subspace of the evaluations of the generators is also invariant under the evaluation of $g$. In this paper, we establish a homogeneous Nullstellensatz for joint invariant subspaces by proving that this equivalence holds whenever the generators are homogeneous. In contrast, we demonstrate that the statement fails in the general case, thereby settling the conjecture completely.</description>

      <title>Just-infinite Jordan Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analogy with the well-established notions of just-infinite groups and just-infinite algebras, in particular $C^*$-algebras, we initiate a study of just-infinite $JB$-algebras, i.e. infinite dimensional $JB$-algebras for which all proper quotients are finite dimensional. We investigate the connections between a just-infinite $C^*$-algebra $A$ and its Jordan algebra $H(A,*)$ of self-adjoint elements. We also show that any just-infinite $JB$-algebra $J$ either is a infinite-dimensional spin factor or there exists a $C^*$-algebra $A$ and just-infinite norm-closed real $*$-subalgebras $A_1$ and $A_2$ of $A$ such that $H(A_1,*)\unlhd J \subseteq H(A_2,*).$</description>

      <title>The Solvabilizers and Solvable Graphs in Lie Superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the solvabilizer and the solvable graph for a Lie superalgebra and establish their basic properties. Then we define a category which links Lie superalgebras to their solvable substructures. Afterwards, we prove that the solvable graph is one of the isomorphic invariants of the Lie superalgebras. Furthermore, we introduce the solvability measure, which can reflect the degree of solvability of Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Ideals in Arbitrary Three-Dimensional Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study arbitrary (not necessarily associative) 3-dimensional algebras. Such an algebra A is determined by a basis and the corresponding multiplication table, which is specified by 27 structure constants. We describe all ideals of A, providing an explicit characterization of both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional ideals. Moreover, we classify 2-dimensional ideals into 4 distinct types. We prove that A either has infinitely many ideals or at most 4. We also show that, in any case, the maximum number of 1-dimensional ideals is 3, while the maximum number of 2-dimensional ideals is 2. Finally, we present a class of algebras with a finite number of ideals that attain this theoretical maximum.</description>

      <title>Finitely Generated Varieties of Commutative BCK-algebras: Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article aims at describing all covers of any finitely generated variety of cBCK-algebras. It is known that subdirectly irreducible cBCK-algebras are rooted trees (concerning their order). Also, all subdirectly irreducible members of finitely generated variety are subalgebras of subdirectly irreducible generators of that variety. The first part of the article focuses on subalgebras of finite subdirectly irreducible cBCK-algebras. In the second part of the article, a construction is presented that provides all the covers of any finitely generated variety.</description>

      <title>A note on Lie and Jordan structures of Leavitt path algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L_K(E)$ be the Leavitt path algebra of a directed graph $E$ over a field $K$. In this paper, we determine $E$ and $K$ for the Lie algebra $\mathbf{K}_{L_K(E)}$ and the Jordan algebra $\mathbf{S}_{L_K(E)}$ arising from $L_K(E)$ with respect to the standard involution to be solvable.</description>

      <title>On the Sylow Theorem for Skew Braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the (first) Sylow theorem for certain classes of finite skew braces, proving it to hold true when the skew brace is two-sided, bi-skew, right nilpotent, $\lambda$-homomorphic or supersoluble. We also show it to hold true for soluble skew braces that are left-nilpotent, and address a number of more specialized settings, proving general Hall-type theorems.</description>

      <title>Covering rings by proper ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cover by left ideals of an associative (not necessarily commutative or unital) ring $R$ is a collection of proper left ideals whose set-theoretic union equals $R$. If such a cover exists, then $\eta_\ell(R)$ is the cardinality of a minimal cover, and $R$ is $\eta_\ell$-elementary if $\eta_\ell(R)&lt;\eta_\ell(R/I)$ for every nonzero two-sided ideal $I$ of $R$. We classify all $\eta_\ell$-elementary rings, and determine their covering numbers. Covers by right or two-sided ideals are also studied. This completely characterizes rings admitting finite covers by ideals. Our results generalize to finite covers of modules by submodules, and we determine all possible covering numbers.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative rings with infinitely many maximal subrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rings with infinitely (only finitely) many maximal subrings. We prove that if $M$ is a maximal left/right ideal of a ring $T$ which is not an ideal of $T$, and $R$ is the idealizer of $M$, then $T$ has at least $|R/M|+1$ maximal left/right ideals which are not an ideal of $T$; in particular $T$ has at least $|R/M|+1$ distinct maximal subrings. Moreover, if $T$ is a $K$-algebra over an infinite field $K$, then either $T$ has infinitely many maximal subrings or $T$ is a quasi duo ring with certain algebraic properties similar to commutative rings. We prove that for a simple ring $R$, the ring $R\times R$ has only finitely many maximal subrings if and only if $R$ is finite. Also we study rings which are integral over their centers and have only finitely many maximal subrings. We prove that if $T$ is integral over its center and $T$ has more than $2^{\aleph_0}$ maximal (left/right) ideals, then $T$ has infinitely many maximal subrings. In particular, we see that if a $J$-semisimple ring $T$ is integral over its center and has only finitely many maximal subrings, then $T$ embeds in $S\times \prod_{i\in I}E_i$, where each $E_i$ is an absolutely algebraic field and $S$ is a finite semisimple ring. We see that if $T$ is a left Noetherian algebraic $K$-algebra over an infinite field $K$ and $T$ has only finitely many maximal subrings, then $T$ is a countable left Artinian ring which is integral over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, where $p=Char(K)$. We exactly determine when $T=\prod_{i\in I}\mathbb{M}_{n_i}(E_i)$, where each $E_i$ is a field and $n_i\in\mathbb{N}$, has only finitely many maximal subrings. We see that if $R$ is an infinite Artinian ring, then $\mathbb{M}_n(R)$, $n&gt;1$, and $R\times R$ have infinitely many maximal subrings.</description>
