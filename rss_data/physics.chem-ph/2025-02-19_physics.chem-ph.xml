      <title>The Q-AMOEBA (CF) Polarizable Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Q-AMOEBA (CF), an enhanced version of the Q-AMOEBA polarizable model that integrates a geometry-dependent charge flux (CF) term while designed for an explicit treatment of nuclear quantum effects (NQE). The inclusion of CF effects allows matching experimental data for the molecular structure of water in both gas and liquid phases, addressing limitations faced by most force fields. We show that Q-AMOEBA (CF) provides highly accurate results for a wide range of thermodynamical properties of liquid water. Using the computational efficiency of the adaptive Quantum Thermal Bath method, which accounts for NQE at a cost comparable to classical molecular dynamics, we evaluate the robustness and transferability of Q-AMOEBA (CF) by calculating hydration free energies of various ions and organic molecules. Finally, we apply this methodology to the alanine dipeptide and compute the corresponding dihedral angle potential of mean force and hydration free energy. Unexpectedly, the latter quantity displays significant NQE. These results pave the way to a finer understanding of their role in biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Heteroepitaxial Growth of Boron Carbide on the Si-Face of 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heteroepitaxial boron carbide (BxC) can be grown on Si face 4H-SiC(0001) using a two-step process involving substrate boridation at 1200$^\circ$C under BCl3 + H2 followed by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth step at 1600$^\circ$C by adding C3H8 precursor. However, in-depth investigation of the early growth stages revealed that complex reactions occur before starting the CVD at high temperature. Indeed, after boridation, the 35 nm BxC buffer layer is covered by an amorphous B-containing layer which evolves and reacts during the temperature ramp up between 1200 to 1600$^\circ$C. Despite the formation of new phases (Si, SiB6), which could be explained by significant solid-state diffusion of Si, C and B elements through the thin BxC layer, the CVD epitaxial re-growth upon reaching 1600$^\circ$C does not seems to be affected by these phases. The resulting single crystalline BxC layers display the epitaxial relationships [1010]BxC(0001)||[1010]4H-SiC(0001). The layers exhibit a B4C composition, e.g. the highest possible C content for the BxC solid solution.</description>

      <title>Transferable Machine Learning Potential X-MACE for Excited States using Integrated DeepSets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conical intersections serve as critical gateways in photochemical reactions, enabling rapid nonradiative transitions between potential energy surfaces that underpin fundamental processes such as photosynthesis or vision. Their calculation with quantum chemistry is, however, extremely computationally intensive and their modeling with machine learning poses a significant challenge due to their inherently non-smooth and complex nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a deep learning architecture designed to precisely model excited states and improve their accuracy around these critical, non-smooth regions. Our model integrates Deep Sets into the Message Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE) framework resulting in a smooth representation of the non-smooth excited-state potential energy surfaces. We validate our method using numerous molecules, showcasing a significant improvement in accurately modeling the energy landscape around conical intersections compared to conventional excited-state models. Additionally, we apply ground-state foundational machine learning models as a basis for excited states. By doing so, we showcase that the developed model is capable of transferring not only from the ground state to excited states, but also within chemical space to molecular systems beyond those included in the training dataset. This advancement not only enhances the fidelity of excited-state modeling, but also lays the foundations for the investigation of more complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Rotational quenching of monofluorides in a cryogenic helium bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buffer gas cooling, one of the most relevant direct cooling techniques for cooling molecules, relies on dissipating the energy of the molecule via collisions with a buffer gas. The cooling efficiency hinges on the molecule-atom scattering properties, concretely, on the transport properties. This work presents a global study on the interactions, collision dynamics, and transport properties of monofluoride molecules (X-F), being X a metal, in the presence of a cold He buffer gas. The interactions are calculated using ab initio quantum chemistry methods, and the dynamics is treated fully quantal, assuming the monofluoride molecule is a rigid rotor. The resulting thermalization and rotational quenching rates are analyzed in light of the Born Distorted Wave Approximation (BDWA), yielding an explanation based on the elemental physical properties of the molecule under consideration. Therefore, the analysis of our results reveals the physics behind the rotational quenching of molecules in the presence of a cold buffer gas.</description>

      <title>Real-time interpretation of neutron vibrational spectra with symmetry-equivariant Hessian matrix prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational behavior of molecules serves as a crucial fingerprint of their structure, chemical state, and surrounding environment. Neutron vibrational spectroscopy provides comprehensive measurements of vibrational modes without selection rule restrictions. However, analyzing and interpreting the resulting spectra remains a computationally formidable task. Here, we introduce a symmetry-aware neural network that directly predicts Hessian matrices from molecular structures, thereby enabling rapid vibrational spectral reconstruction. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on eigenvalue prediction, the Hessian matrix provides richer, more fundamental information with broader applications and superior extrapolation. This approach also paves the way for predicting other properties, such as reaction pathways. Trained on small molecules, our model achieves spectroscopic-level accuracy, allowing real-time, unambiguous peak assignment. Moreover, it maintains high accuracy for larger molecules, demonstrating strong transferability. This adaptability unlocks new capabilities, including on-the-fly spectral interpretation for future autonomous laboratories, and offers insights into molecular design for targeted chemical pathways.</description>

      <title>Many-body theory and Gaussian-basis implementation of positron annihilation $\gamma$-ray spectra on polyatomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doppler-broadened $\gamma$-ray spectra for positron annihilation on molecules are calculated using many-body theory. By employing Gaussian bases for the electron and positron wavefunctions, a computable expression that involves a four-centre integral over the two-annihilation-photon momenta is derived for the $\gamma$ spectra in the independent particle model approximation to the annihilation vertex, and implemented in the open-source {\tt EXCITON+} code. The influence of electron-positron correlations on the $\gamma$ spectra is examined through \textit{ab initio} treatment of the positron wavefunction, whilst corrections to the annihilation vertex are treated approximately via enhancement factors previously calculated [D. G. Green and G. F. Gribakin, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\bf 114}, 093201 (2015)] exactly for atoms. Calculated $\gamma$ spectra for furan and acetonitrile are presented for annihilation from the positron bound state with electrons of individual molecular orbitals. For such annihilation from the positron-molecule bound state, it is found that the magnitude of the partial contribution to the $\gamma$ spectra from individual molecular orbitals depends not just on the orbital energies, but also on the molecular symmetry, more precisely the relative localisation of the positron and electron densities.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetry rules of response properties in certain chemical spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic BN-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. Response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power. The origin of this predictive power was clarified based on alchemical perturbation density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent molecular rotor-based polymer materials for local microviscosity mapping in microfluidic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A viscosity-sensitive monomer consisting of a methacrylate-functionalized julolidone-based molecular rotor (MECVJ) was synthesized and used to obtain viscosity-sensitive polymers (poly(DMA-\textit{s}-MECVJ)). The qualitative properties of the molecular rotor were preserved after its inclusion in the new polymer, in particular the effect of the viscosity of the surrounding medium on the fluorescence lifetime of the rotor. By grafting these polymers onto glass slides, viscosity-sensitive surfaces were obtained, showing good robustness in time after successive use and washing. As proof of concept, these surfaces were used to assemble a microfluidic chip capable of mapping viscosity of fluids flowing inside the channel.</description>

      <title>Zepto to Attosecond core-level photoemission time delays in homonuclear diatomic molecules and non-dipole effects in the framework of Multiple Scattering theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study theoretically investigates the angular distribution of core-level photoemission time delay within a molecular frame. This phenomenon can be measured with the advancement of attosecond pulsed lasers and metrology. Our focus is on homonuclear diatomic molecules. The two-center interference patterns observed in the gerade and ungerade core-level Molecular-Frame Photoelectron Angular Distributions (MFPAD) of homonuclear diatomic molecules demonstrate symmetry breaking with respect to the direction of light propagation, attributed to the non-dipole (multipole) effect. Our study delves into the photoemission time delay resulting from the non-dipole effect through the introduction of a theoretical model. We reveal that when considering the contributions from the gerade and ungerade delocalized states in incoherent sums, the two-center interference terms cancel each other in both the MFPADs and photoemission time delays. However, a residual term persists showcasing the non-dipole effect in the photoemission time delays. Furthermore, by expanding the scattering state of photoelectrons using the Multiple Scattering theory, we demonstrate the significant role played by the scattering of photoelectrons at the molecular potential in describing the photoemission time delays of homonuclear diatomic molecules. Next, we apply our theoretical model to a nitrogen molecule, demonstrating the energy- and angular-dependent characteristics of the MFPADs and photoemission time delays through both analytical and numerical approaches. The incoherent sums of the MFPADs in both forward and backward directions exhibit equal intensity, whereas the incoherent sums of the photoemission time delays show a slight variation of a few hundred zeptoseconds compared with numerical calculations using a multiple scattering code.</description>

      <title>Non-iterative Triples for Transcorrelated Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an implementation of a perturbative triples correction for the coupled cluster ansatz including single and double excitations based on the transcorrelated Hamiltonian. Transcorrelation introduces explicit electron correlation in the electronic Hamiltonian through similarity transformation with a correlation factor. Due to this transformation, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian includes up to three-body couplings and becomes non-Hermitian. Since the conventional coupled cluster equations are solved by projection, it is well suited to harbor non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The arising three-body operator, however, creates a huge memory bottleneck and increases the runtime scaling of the coupled cluster equations. As it has been shown that the three-body operator can be approximated, by expressing the Hamiltonian in the normal-ordered form, we investigate this approximation for the perturbative triples correction. Results are compared with a code-generation based transcorrelated coupled cluster implementation up to quadruple excitations.</description>

      <title>CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ Adsorption Mechanisms on Monolayer Graphenylene and their Effects on Optical and Electronic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ a computational chemistry-based modeling approach to investigate the adsorption mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on monolayer GPNL, with a specific focus on their effects on optical adsorption and electrical transport properties at room temperature. To simulate the adsorption dynamics as closely as possible to experimental conditions, we utilize the self-consistent charge tight-binding density functional theory (SCC-DFTB). Through semi-classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we observe the formation of H$_2$ molecules from the dissociation of CH$_4$ and the formation of CO+O species from carbon dioxide molecules. This provides insights into the adsorption and dispersion mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on GPNL. Furthermore, we explore the impact of molecular adsorption on optical absorption properties. Our results demonstrate that CH$_4$ and CH$_2$ affects drastically the optical adsorption of GPNL, while CO$_2$ does not significantly affect the optical properties of the two-dimensional material. To analyze electron transport, we employ the open-boundary non-equilibrium Green's function method. By studying the conductivity of GPNL and graphene under voltage bias up to 300 mV, we gain valuable insights into the electrical transport properties of GPNL under optical absorption conditions. The findings from our computational modeling approach might contribute to a deeper understanding of the potential applications of GPNL in hydrogen production and advanced electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing in Corrosion Modeling: Bridging Research and Industry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Corrosion presents a major challenge to the longevity and reliability of products across various industries, particularly in the aerospace sector. Corrosion arises from chemical processes occurring on an atomistic scale, which lead to macroscopic degradation. Addressing this issue requires multi-scale modeling approaches, which rely on microscopic parameters that are challenging to measure experimentally or model with conventional quantum chemistry techniques. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a hybrid quantum-classical workflow tailored for atomistic simulations of corrosion processes, with a specific focus on the initial step of the oxygen reduction reaction -- a critical trigger for the corrosion of aluminum alloys widely used in modern aircraft. Using a combination of classical quantum chemistry methods and quantum computing frameworks, we identify reaction geometries characterized by multi-configurational electronic structures that are ideal for exploring with quantum algorithms. For the first time in this context, we explore both noisy intermediate-scale quantum and fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for these multi-configurational system, integrating them within a workflow designed to bridge atomistic simulations with macroscopic modeling approaches, such as finite element methods. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed quantum resource estimation to assess when and how quantum computers may play a meaningful role in tackling these problems. Our results demonstrate that significant advancements in quantum hardware but also in algorithms and error correction techniques are needed to make quantum computation practically viable for this class of problems. Nevertheless, this work establishes a critical foundation for applying quantum computation to corrosion modeling and highlights its potential to address complex, business-relevant challenges in materials science.</description>
