      <title>Serotonin as a Creativity Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The location of Western Civilization defined nations in Europe and in the United States within the largest global pollen environments on the planet is proposed as a key factor leading to their success. Environments with dense pollen concentrations will cause large up and down changes in serum histamine directly causing reductions and increases in brain serotonin i.e., a larger serotonin slope, linked to higher levels of creativity. The pollen ecosystem in northern latitude nations is thus considered the hidden driver of the success of these populations as the biochemical interaction between histamine and serotonin leads to a creativity pump that is proposed as the fundamental driver of intelligence in micro and macro human populations.</description>

      <title>The Economics of Coal Phaseouts: Auctions as a Novel Policy Instrument for the Energy Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combustion of coal, the most polluting form of energy, must be significantly curtailed to limit global average temperature increase to well below 2 degrees C. The effectiveness of carbon pricing is frequently undermined by sub-optimally low prices and rigid market structures. Consequently, alternative approaches such as compensation for the early closure of coal-fired power plants are being considered. While bilateral negotiations can lead to excessive compensation due to asymmetric information, a competitive auction can discover the true cost of closure and help allocate funds more efficiently and transparently. Since Germany is the only country till date to have implemented a coal phaseout auction, we use it to analyse the merits and demerits of the policy, drawing comparisons with other countries that have phased out coal through other means. The German experience with coal phaseout auctions illustrates the necessity of considering additionality and interaction with existing climate policies, managing dynamic incentives, and evaluating impacts on security of supply. While theoretically auctions have attractive properties, in practice, their design must address these concerns to unlock the full benefits. Where auctions are not appropriate due to a concentration in coal plant ownership, alternative strategies include enhanced incentives for scrappage and repurposing of coal assets.</description>

      <title>Identification of fiscal SVAR-IVs in small open economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel instrumental variable to identify fiscal shocks in small open economies. Under the assumptions that unexpected changes in trading partners correlate with output of an open economy and unexpected fiscal shocks of a small economy are unrelated to its trading partners' forecast errors, we use forecast errors of trading partner economies to proxy unexpected shocks in domestic output. We show that this instrument is relevant and find evidence that supports its exogeneity. Using this IV strategy, we find that the two-year cumulative spending multiplier is around 1 for Canada and 0.5 for euro area small open economies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing supply chain security with automated machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study tackles the complexities of global supply chains, which are increasingly vulnerable to disruptions caused by port congestion, material shortages, and inflation. To address these challenges, we explore the application of machine learning methods, which excel in predicting and optimizing solutions based on large datasets. Our focus is on enhancing supply chain security through fraud detection, maintenance prediction, and material backorder forecasting. We introduce an automated machine learning framework that streamlines data analysis, model construction, and hyperparameter optimization for these tasks. By automating these processes, our framework improves the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain security measures. Our research identifies key factors that influence machine learning performance, including sampling methods, categorical encoding, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization. We demonstrate the importance of considering these factors when applying machine learning to supply chain challenges. Traditional mathematical programming models often struggle to cope with the complexity of large-scale supply chain problems. Our study shows that machine learning methods can provide a viable alternative, particularly when dealing with extensive datasets and complex patterns. The automated machine learning framework presented in this study offers a novel approach to supply chain security, contributing to the existing body of knowledge in the field. Its comprehensive automation of machine learning processes makes it a valuable contribution to the domain of supply chain management.</description>

      <title>Global Solutions to Master Equations for Continuous Time Heterogeneous Agent Macroeconomic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and compare new global solution algorithms for continuous time heterogeneous agent economies with aggregate shocks. First, we approximate the agent distribution so that equilibrium in the economy can be characterized by a high, but finite, dimensional non-linear partial differential equation. We consider different approximations: discretizing the number of agents, discretizing the agent state variables, and projecting the distribution onto a finite set of basis functions. Second, we represent the value function using a neural network and train it to solve the differential equation using deep learning tools. We refer to the solution as an Economic Model Informed Neural Network (EMINN). The main advantage of this technique is that it allows us to find global solutions to high dimensional, non-linear problems. We demonstrate our algorithm by solving important models in the macroeconomics and spatial literatures (e.g. Krusell and Smith (1998), Khan and Thomas (2007), Bilal (2023)).</description>

      <title>Zonal vs. Nodal Pricing: An Analysis of Different Pricing Rules in the German Day-Ahead Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European electricity market is based on large pricing zones with a uniform day-ahead price. The energy transition leads to changes in supply and demand and increasing redispatch costs. In an attempt to ensure efficient market clearing and congestion management, the EU Commission has mandated the Bidding Zone Review (BZR) to reevaluate the configuration of European bidding zones. Based on a unique data set published in the context of the BZR for the target year 2025, we compare various pricing rules for the German power market. We compare market clearing and pricing for different zonal and nodal models, including their generation costs and associated redispatch costs. In numerical experiments with this dataset, the differences in the average prices in different zones are low. Congestion arises as well, but not necessarily on the cross-zonal interconnectors. The total costs across different configurations are similar and the reduction of standard deviations in prices is also small. This might be different with other load and generation scenarios, but the BZR data is important as it was created to make a decision about splits of the existing bidding zones. Nodal pricing rules lead to the lowest total cost. We also evaluate differences of nodal pricing rules with respect to the necessary uplift payments, which is relevant in the context of the current discussion on non-uniform pricing in the EU. While the study focuses on Germany, the analysis is relevant beyond and feeds into the broader discussion about pricing rules in non-convex markets.</description>
