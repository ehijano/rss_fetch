      <title>Deriving a working hypothesis in thermodynamics on electromagnetic work from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maxwell stress tensor for the linear and uniform media in static electromagnetic field implies a new form of pressure caused by the mutual field energy density. When it is introduced into the fundamental thermodynamic equation for the media, we have a new pressure-volume work term. The combination of new term and proper electromagnetic work term naturally gives the well-known form that is currently obtained by a working hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Classical Mechanics from Energy Conservation or: Why not Momentum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that energy conservation allows for a ``heuristic'' derivation of Newtonian mechanics, if the energy is presumed to be an additive function of position and velocity. It is shown that energy must be depicted as a function of position and momentum in order to allow for the correct relativistic equations. Accordingly it is argued that not only quantum theory but also special relativity is intrinsically Hamiltonian and requires a description by coordinates and momenta instead of coordinates and velocities. Furthermore it is argued that the usual historical order of the ``formulations'' of mechanics, from Newtonian via Lagrangian to Hamiltonian mechanics, is illogical and misleading. Therefore it should be reversed.</description>

      <title>Effective transport barriers in the biquadratic nontwist map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nontwist area-preserving maps violate the twist condition at specific orbits, resulting in shearless invariant curves that prevent chaotic transport. Plasmas and fluids with nonmonotonic equilibrium profiles may be described using nontwist systems, where even after these shearless curves breakdown, effective transport barriers persist, partially reducing transport coefficients. Some nontwist systems present multiple shearless curves in phase space, increasing the complexity of transport phenomena, which have not been thoroughly investigated until now. In this work, we examine the formation of effective transport barriers in a nontwist area-preserving mapping with multiple shearless transport barriers. By quantifying the effectiveness of each transport barrier in phase space, we identified two scenarios where particular barriers dominate over others. Our results also reveal configurations where the interplay of two transport barriers creates regions in phase space with significant orbit trapping, thereby influencing the overall transport dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of reverberation theory in a diffuse sound field by using reflection orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The room acoustics was established based on Sabine's reverberation theory. However, in Sabine's theory, the reverberation time does not reach zero, even if the absolute absorption condition is satisfied. Eyring revised the reverberation theory to resolve this contradiction. However, Eyring's theory is inconsistent in its formulation of the steady state and decay processes. Therefore, the author has revised Sabine's theory (Hanyu, Acoustical Science &amp; Technology 45, 3, 2024), taking a different approach from that of Eyring. This revised theory was constructed by introducing the concept of "reverberation of a direct sound". In this paper, a new mathematical model of reverberation using reflection orders is proposed. This means that the revised theory already proposed by the author is reconstructed to include the temporal energy distributions in each reflection order. The new mathematical model also uses the concept of "reverberation of a direct sound" but describes the reverberation of only reflected sounds without the direct sound. This means that the concept of "reverberation of a direct sound" is essential also to the entire reverberation process. Reverberation decay of the new model is consistent with that of the already proposed revised theory. The new model showed good correspondence with the simulation results.</description>

      <title>Geometrical description and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12252v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>
