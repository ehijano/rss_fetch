      <title>Electromagnetic Single-nucleon Response involving Polarized Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is an extension of our past study focused on a covariant representation of the electromagnetic (EM) current of spin-1/2 Dirac particles, specifically, nucleons. In the past study the EM responses that occur in unpolarized electron scattering from unpolarized nucleons were derived; however, scattering of polarized electrons from polarized nucleons was beyond the scope of that earlier work. Here such extensions are studied in detail. While in other work the EM response has already been developed for the double-polarization scattering problem, that effort was focused on high-energy collider physics. In the present study the formalism is recast into a set of EM response functions that have transparent dependencies on the relevant kinematic variables, especially on how these behave with respect to the momentum p of the (moving) struck, polarized nucleon. The motivation for such a reformulation of the problem is the desire to see a clear path to expansions in $p$ of the EM response for use in devising ``prescriptions for nuclear physics''. Results are provided where comparisons of the full (unexpanded) responses with various approximations that are frequently employed in studies of EM nuclear physics are made, demonstrating that under some circumstances such approximations are reasonable, whereas in other circumstances the expanded results are likely to be invalid. In addition, the EM current operators and approximations to them are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Competing shape evolution, crossing configurations and single particle levels in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of shape in the even-even zirconium (Zr) isotopes has been the subject of study for many years. However, the odd-mass isotopes have not been investigated as extensively due to limited experimental accessibility and computational challenges. This work, employing the interacting boson-fermion model with configuration mixing, examines the effect of rapid shape evolution and normal-intruder configuration crossing -- both identified as quantum phase transitions -- alongside evolution in single particle energies, on the positive-parity spectrum of odd-mass $^\text{93-103}$Zr isotopes. Calculated energy levels, magnetic moments, $B(E2)$ values, and quadrupole moments are compared to experimental data, showing good agreement. The special case of $^{99}$Zr, which lies near the critical point of both quantum phase transitions, is also addressed, offering a new interpretation to the $7/2^+_1$ isomeric state and the occurrence of the type II shell evolution, in light of recent debates.</description>

      <title>KDAR neutrino scattering for $^{12}$C target via charged current and muon angular distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate muon-neutrino ($\nu_{\mu}$) scattering off $^{12}$C via charged current (CC) by exploiting the 236 MeV ${\nu_{\mu}}$ from the kaon-decay-at-rest (KDAR). In this energy region, since both inelastic scattering below the quasielastic (QE) region and the QE scattering contribute simultaneously, we combine the inelastic scattering obtained by the QRPA and the QE scattering obtained by distorted wave born approximation (DWBA) based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) theory. We compare the results to the data from MiniBooNE. Further, since the KDR $\nu_{\mu}$ CC scattering may have angle dependence of outgoing muon, we investigate the differential angular dependent cross section in the ${\nu_{\mu}}$-$^{12}$C scattering and compare to the results by $\nu_e$-$^{12}$C scattering. These results could be useful for the calibration of the forthcoming KDAR neutrino cross section experiments.</description>

      <title>tParton: an updated implementation of next-to-leading order transversity evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide code to solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for the nucleon transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs), which encode nucleon transverse spin structure. Though codes are widely available for the evolution of unpolarized and polarized PDFs, there are no recent codes publicly available for the transversity PDF. Here, we present Python code which implements two methods of solving the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) approximations of the DGLAP equations for the transversity PDF, and we highlight the theoretical differences between the two.</description>

      <title>Corrections from space-time dependent electromagnetic fields to Wigner functions and spin polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have derived the Wigner equations at global equilibrium with constant vorticity but space-time dependent electromagnetic fields up to second order in semiclassical expansion. We obtain the new second-order contributions to the charge currents and energy-momentum tensor from the varying electromagnetic fields. We also compute the new corrections to the spin polarization pesudo-vector from both contant and varying electromagnetic fields. We also find that the space-time dependent electromagnetic field provides a tighter constraint on the solutions of Wigner functions in global equilibrium compared with constant electromagnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive self-consistent constraint conditions for collision terms in quantum kinetic theory within Wigner function formalism. We present simple specific solutions for the collision terms in quantum kinetic theory which is compatible with these constraints. We obtain the self-consistent quantum kinetic theory at relaxation-time approximation, with which we discuss spin polarization effects and electric charge separation effects in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle production in photon-photon ($\gamma \gamma$) interactions present in electron-ion collisions is investigated. We present calculations for the total cross sections and event rates related to the production of light mesons [$\eta, \eta^\prime, f_0$ and $f_2$], charmonium [$\eta_c$ and $\chi_c$] and charmoniumlike [$X(3915), X(3940), X(4140)$ and $X(6900)$] states, considering the EIC, EicC, LHeC and FCC-eh energies. Our predictions demonstrate that experimental studies of these processes are feasible and useful to constrain the properties of light mesons and quarkonium states and shed some light on the configuration of the considered charmoniumlike states.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity and thermal Hall effect in dense electron-ion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall effect in electron-ion plasmas relevant to hot neutron stars, white dwarfs, and binary neutron star mergers, focusing on densities found in the outer crusts of neutron stars and the interiors of white dwarfs. We consider plasma consisting of single species of ions, which could be either iron $\isotope[56]{Fe}$, carbon $\isotope[12]{C}$, helium $\isotope[4]{He}$, or hydrogen $\isotope[1]{H}$ nuclei. The temperature range explored is from the melting temperature of the solid $T\sim10^9$~K up to $10^{11}$~K. This covers both degenerate and non-degenerate electron regimes. We find that thermal conductivity increases with density and temperature for which we provide analytical scaling relations valid in different regimes. The impact of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity is also analyzed, showing anisotropy in low-density regions and the presence of the thermal Hall effect characterized by Leduc-Righi coefficient. The transition from degenerate to non-degenerate regime is characterized by a minimum ratio of thermal conductivity to temperature, which is analogous to the minimum observed already in the case of electrical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Density correlations under global and local charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a formalism to compute spatial $n$-point correlations of a conserved charge density in a large thermal system in the canonical ensemble, with explicit results presented up to 4th order. The resulting correlators contain local and balancing terms expressed through the grand-canonical susceptibilities for any equation of state. The new formalism is used to introduce a Gaussian local baryon number conservation in (spatial) rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at LHC conditions through a modulation of the balancing term. Connection to the widely used conservation volume $V_c = k dV/dy$ approach is established, indicating that the latter is appropriate for observables within $k/2$ units around midrapidity with $k \approx \sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_y$ with $\sigma_y$ being the Gaussian rapidity width of local baryon conservation. Analysis of the experimental data of the ALICE Collaboration on net proton cumulants in central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV constraints the range of local baryon conservation to $\sigma_{y} = 0.78^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$ units, equivalent to $V_c = (1.95^{+0.48}_{-0.39}) dV/dy$ in the conservation volume approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leading Fock state light-front wave functions of heavy quarkonia and $D$ and $B$ mesons are obtained from the projections of their Bethe-Salpeter wave functions on the light front. We compute therefrom their leading-twist time-reversal even transverse momentum distributions and parton distribution functions. Mirroring the behavior of parton distribution amplitudes, the support of both distributions is increasingly narrower and shifted towards larger $x$ as a function of the meson mass. The dependence of $x$ and $\k_\perp^2$ of the transverse distributions does not factorize into separate functions, and their fall-off with $\k_\perp^2$ is much slower than that of light mesons.</description>

      <title>Entropy in Toy Regge models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probabilistic interpretation of the standard Regge-Gribov model with triple pomeron interactions is discussed. It is stated that introduction of probabilities within this model is not unique and depends on what is meant under the relevant substructures, The traditional interpretation in terms of partons (quarks and gluons) is shown to be external to the model, imported from the QCD, and actually referring to the single pomeron exchange without interactions. So this interpretation actually forgets the model as such. Alternative probabilities based on the pomerons as basic quantities within the model are discussed. Two different approaches are considered, based either on the pomerons in Fock's expansion of the wave function or on pomeron propagators in Feynman diagrams. These pomeron probabilities and entropy turn out to be very different from the mentioned standard ones in the purelyp obabilistic treatment. The entropy, in particular, either rises with the rapidity and saturates at a certain fixed value or first rises, reaches some maximum and goes down to zero afterwards. Possible observable manifestations of these probabilities and entropy are to be seen in the distributions of the cross-section in powers of the coupling constants to the participants. 23</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constituting the largest subset of multiquark states so far observed by experiment, tetraquark mesons carrying overall quark flavour quantum numbers identical to those of the (conventional) quark-antiquark mesons necessitate their particularly deliberate phenomenological analyses. A collection of (more or less recent) insights specific to the latter subclass of exotic hadrons bears the promise to enable even significant improvement in the understanding of these hadrons by theoretical approaches such as, among others, the framework of QCD sum rules.</description>

      <title>Inclusive photoproduction of vector quarkonium in ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of using ultra-peripheral proton-lead collisions at the LHC to study inclusive vector-quarkonium photoproduction, that occurs when a quasi-real photon emitted by a fully stripped lead ion breaks a proton to produce a vector quarkonium. Owing to the extremely large energies of the colliding hadrons circulating in the LHC, the range of accessible photon-nucleon centre-of-mass energies, W_gamma+p, largely exceeds what has been and will be studied at lepton-hadron colliders, HERA and the EIC. We perform a tune to HERA photoproduction data, use this tune to predict the yields of photoproduced J/psi, and estimate the corresponding transverse-momentum reach at LHC experiments. We also model the hadroproduction background and demonstrate that inclusive photoproduction can be isolated at the LHC from such background by imposing constraints on the hadronic activity in the lead-going direction at mid, forward, or far-forward rapidities depending on the capability of the detector under consideration. We find that the resulting cross sections are large enough to be measured by ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb. We estimate the background-to-signal ratio after isolation to be of the order of 0.001 and 0.1 in the low and large transverse-momentum regions, respectively. In addition, we propose and assess the Jacquet-Blondel method to reconstruct the photon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy and the fractional energy of the quarkonium with respect to the photon.</description>

      <title>Implications of first neutrino-induced nuclear recoil measurements in direct detection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PandaX-4T and XENONnT have recently reported the first measurement of nuclear recoils induced by the $^8$B solar neutrino flux, through the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) channel. As long anticipated, this is an important milestone for dark matter searches as well as for neutrino physics. This measurement means that these detectors have reached exposures such that searches for low mass, $\lesssim 10$ GeV dark matter cannot be analyzed using the background-free paradigm going forward. It also opens a new era for these detectors to be used as neutrino observatories. In this paper we assess the sensitivity of these new measurements to new physics in the neutrino sector. We focus on neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) and show that -- despite the still moderately low statistical significance of the signals -- these data already provide valuable information. We find that limits on NSI from PandaX-4T and XENONnT measurements are comparable to those derived using combined COHERENT CsI and LAr data, as well as those including the latest Ge measurement. Furthermore, they provide sensitivity to pure $\tau$ flavor parameters that are not accessible using stopped-pion or reactor sources. With further improvements of statistical uncertainties as well as larger exposures, forthcoming data from these experiments will provide important, novel results for CE$\nu$NS-related physics.</description>

      <title>Study of the heavy quarks energy loss through medium polarization, elastic collision and radiative processes</title>

Abstract: Heavy quarks serve as crucial probes for exploring the properties of the hot and dense medium formed in heavy-ion collision experiments. Understanding the modification of their energy as they traverse the medium is a focal point of research, with various authors extensively studying this phenomenon. This study specifically concentrates on the equilibrium phase, the quark-gluon plasma, and offers a comparative analysis of heavy quark energy loss through medium polarization, elastic collisions, and radiation. Notably, while previous studies have compared polarization loss and radiation, our work extends this by incorporating elastic collisions for a more comprehensive examination. The significance of medium polarization, particularly at low momentum, is underscored, as it has been found to contribute substantially. The formalism for energy loss and drag coefficient in each case is presented, followed by the calculation of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) for a holistic comparative study.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Informed Interactions in Dense Matter: Inclusion of PSR J0437-4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how vector-isoscalar and vector-isovector interactions can be determined within the density regime of neutron stars (NSs), while fulfilling nuclear and astrophysics constrains. We make use of the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model, a SU(3) nonlinear realization of the sigma model within the mean-field approximation, for the first time within a Bayesian analysis framework. We show that neutron-matter $\chi$EFT constraints at low density are only satisfied if the vector-isovector mixed interaction term is included, e.g., a $\omega^2\rho^2$ term. We also show the behavior of the model with respect to the conformal limit. We demonstrate that the CMF model is able to predict a value for the parameter $d_c$ related to the trace anomaly and its derivative takes values below 0.2 above four times saturation density within a hadronic version of the model that does not include hyperons or a phase transition to deconfined matter. We compare these effects with results from other (non-chiral) Relativistic Mean Field models to assess how different approaches to incorporating the same physical constraints affect predictions of NS properties and dense matter equations of state. We also include data from the gravitation wave event GW230529 detected by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration and the most recent radius measurement of PSR J0437-4715 from the NASA NICER mission. Our analysis reveals that this new NICER measurement leads to an average reduction of approximately $\sim 0.1$ km radius in the posterior of the NS mass-radius relationship.</description>

      <title>Spherical-like spectra for the description of the normal states of $^{108-120}$Cd in the SU3-IBM and the $Q_{2_{1}^{+}}$ anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08198v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cd puzzle implies that the phonon excitation of a spherical nucleus should be questioned and refuted. For understanding this spherical-like $\gamma$-soft mode newly found experimentally, a possible answer was proposed recently in the SU3-IBM. In this paper, the evolutions of the normal states in $^{108-120}$Cd are investigated and compared with the experimental results. For better explaining the nearly zero B(E2) values between the $0_{2}^{+}$ state and the $2_{1}^{+}$ state, except for the SU(3) second-order and third-order Casimir operators, other SU(3) higher-order interactions are also considered in detail. It can be found that the results of theoretical fitting and experimental data agree well with simple parameter selection. The spherical-like spectra really exist. The deficiency may come from the lack of configuration mixing. The realistic spectra characteristics of the spherical-like spectra are found for $^{118,120}$Cd and the electric quadrupole moments of the $2_{1}^{+}$ state are predicted. The $Q_{2_{1}^{+}}$ anomaly in $^{108-116}$Cd are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the charge radii difference in mirror partner nuclei and the symmetry energy slope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A correlation between the charge radii difference of mirror partner nuclei $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and the slope parameter $L$ of symmetry energy has been built to ascertain the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. In this work, the influences of pairing correlations and isoscalar compression modulus on the $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ are systematically investigated based on the Skyrme energy density functional theory. The calculated results suggest that the linear correlation between $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and $L$ is decreased by the surface pairing correlations. The slope parameter deduced from the difference of charge radii of mirror-pair nuclei $^{32}$Ar-$^{32}$Si, $^{36}$Ca-$^{36}$S, $^{38}$Ca-$^{38}$Ar, and $^{54}$Ni-$^{54}$Fe falls into the range of $L$=42.57-50.64 MeV, that is, the rather soft equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter. Besides, the range of the slope parameter can also be influenced by the effective forces classified by various isoscalar incompressibility coefficients.</description>

      <title>Vertex correction to nuclear matrix elements of double-$\beta$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The predicted neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is the crucial phenomenon to prove the existence of the Majorana neutrino, which gives a foundation to leptogenesis to explain the matter prevalence of the universe. The nuclear matrix element (NME) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay is an important theoretical quantity to determine the effective neutrino mass and help the detector design for the next generation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search. Reliable calculation of this NME is a long-standing problem because of the diversity of the predicted values of the NME. The main reason for this difficulty is that the effective strength of the Gamow-Teller transition operator $g_A$ for this decay is unknown. I will show the lowest-order vertex corrections for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME of $^{136}$Xe in the framework of the hybrid application of the quantum field theory to the leptons and the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation to the nucleus. The unperturbed nuclear states are obtained by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation. These corrections reduce the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME by 30%. The effective $g_A$ referring to this reduced NME is also obtained, and it is shown for the first time that the effective $g_A$ for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME is not quite different from that for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME; the difference is only 10%. This indicates the possibility that the phenomenological effective $g_A$ to reproduce the experimental half-life of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay can be approximately used for the calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME.</description>

      <title>Interrelation between $\bar{p}$-Ca Atom Spectra and Nuclear Density Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies $\bar{p}$-Ca atom spectra in light of the strong shifts and level widths, using the optical model with several types of parametric coefficients. The spectroscopic quantities are obtained as the eigenvalues of the Dirac equation, where the nuclear densities computed via nuclear Density Functional Theory and the effect of the anomalous magnetic moment are incorporated. The results indicate that the isovector term's contribution to the optical potential is crucial for explaining the systematical differences in the strong shifts between $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. Furthermore, it is found that both the strong shifts and the level widths exhibit significant dependence on the nuclear density profiles. These findings provide critical insights into the nuclear structures, particularly in the context of Calcium isotopes, by offering a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying nuclear-hadron properties.</description>

      <title>Emergence of microphysical bulk viscosity in binary neutron star post-merger dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nuclear matter in isolated neutron stars, the flavor content (e.g., proton fraction) is subject to weak interactions, establishing flavor ($\beta$-)equilibrium. However, there can be deviations from this equilibrium during the merger of two neutron stars. We study the resulting out-of-equilibrium dynamics during the collision by incorporating direct and modified Urca processes (in the neutrino-transparent regime) into general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations with a simplified neutrino transport scheme. We demonstrate how weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in post-merger simulations can emerge and assess the bulk viscous dynamics of the resulting flow. We further place limits on the impact on the post-merger gravitational wave strain. Our results show that weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity can potentially lead to a phase shift of the post-merger gravitational wave spectrum, although the effect is currently on the same level as the numerical errors of our simulation.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beauty in the Quark-Gluon Plasma with Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy quarks created in heavy-ion collisions serve as an excellent probe of the produced quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The radiation pattern of jets formed from heavy quarks as they traverse the QGP exhibits a particularly interesting structure due to the interplay of two competing effects: the suppression of small-angle radiation, also known as the ``dead-cone'' effect, and the enhancement of emitted gluons by medium-induced radiation. In this Letter, we propose a new observable, based on the energy correlator approach to jet substructure, which will allow us to disentangle the two scales associated to these two phenomena and to determine under which conditions the dead-cone is filled by medium-induced radiation. Combined with the forthcoming high-statistics measurements of heavy-flavor jets, this work provides a novel tool to unravel the dynamics of the QGP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi function $F(Z,E)$ accounts for QED corrections to beta decays that are enhanced at either small electron velocity $\beta$ or large nuclear charge $Z$. For precision applications, the Fermi function must be combined with other radiative corrections and with scale- and scheme-dependent hadronic matrix elements. We formulate the Fermi function as a field theory object and present a new factorization formula for QED radiative corrections to beta decays. We provide new results for the anomalous dimension of the corresponding effective operator complete through three loops, and resum perturbative logarithms and $\pi$-enhancements with renormalization group methods. Our results are important for tests of fundamental physics with precision beta decay and related processes.</description>

Abstract: In the limit of large nuclear charge, $Z\gg 1$, or small lepton velocity, $\beta \ll 1$, Coulomb corrections to nuclear beta decay and related processes are enhanced as $Z\alpha/\beta$ and become large or even non-perturbative (with $\alpha$ the QED fine structure constant). We provide a constructive demonstration of factorization to all orders in perturbation theory for these processes and compute the all-orders hard and soft functions appearing in the factorization formula. We clarify the relationship between effective field theory amplitudes and historical treatments of beta decay in terms of a Fermi function.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Confinement Transitions in QCD from Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories with fundamental matter there is typically no sharp way to distinguish confining and Higgs regimes, e.g. using generalized global symmetries acting on loop order parameters. It is standard lore that these two regimes are continuously connected, as has been explicitly demonstrated in certain lattice and continuum models. We point out that Higgsing and confinement sometimes lead to distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- necessarily separated by a phase transition -- for ordinary global symmetries. We present explicit examples in 3+1 dimensions, obtained by adding elementary Higgs fields and Yukawa couplings to QCD while preserving parity P and time reversal T. In a suitable scheme, the confining phases of these theories are trivial SPTs, while their Higgs phases are characterized by non-trivial P- and T-invariant theta-angles $\theta_f, \theta_g = \pi$ for flavor or gravity background gauge fields, i.e. they are topological insulators or superconductors. Finally, we consider conventional three-flavor QCD (without elementary Higgs fields) at finite $U(1)_B$ baryon-number chemical potential $\mu_B$, which preserves P and T. At very large $\mu_B$, three-flavor QCD is known to be a completely Higgsed color superconductor that also spontaneously breaks $U(1)_B$. We argue that this high-density phase is in fact a gapless SPT, with a gravitational theta-angle $\theta_g = \pi$ that safely co-exists with the $U(1)_B$ Nambu-Goldstone boson. We explain why this SPT motivates unexpected transitions in the QCD phase diagram, as well as anomalous surface modes at the boundary of quark-matter cores inside neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: The anomalous dimension for heavy-heavy-light effective theory operators describing nuclear beta decay is computed through three-loop order in the static limit. The result at order $Z^2\alpha^3$ corrects a previous result in the literature. An all-orders symmetry is shown to relate the anomalous dimensions at leading and subleading powers of $Z$ at a given order of $\alpha$. The first unknown coefficient for the anomalous dimension now appears at $O(Z^2\alpha^4)$.</description>

Abstract: We discuss QED radiative corrections to contact operators coupling two heavy fields and one light field. New eikonal identities are derived in the static limit that demonstrate the equivalence of a class of ladder graphs to an equivalent theory with a single heavy-light vertex and a background Coulomb field which communicates exclusively with the light field. We apply these new identities to nuclear beta decays and demonstrates that the "independent particle model" used by Jaus, Rasche, Sirlin \&amp; Zucchini is closely related, though not identical, to a model independent EFT calculation.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the mass and width of the doubly heavy tetraquark $T_{ccs}$ composed of a heavy diquark and a light-quark cloud with strangeness with assuming that a color antitriplet heavy diquark is a dominant component of the doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}$ and $T_{ccs}$. We construct an effective Lagrangian for masses of heavy hadrons based on the superflavor symmetry between the doubly heavy tetraquarks and the singly heavy baryons by including the terms that simultaneously break the heavy-quark and light-flavor symmetries, and predict the mass of $T_{ccs}$ as $M(T_{ccs}) = 4047\pm11$\,MeV. The comparison of this prediction with future experimental observation will give a clue to understand the color structure of the heavy diquark. We also predict the mass of $\Omega_{cc}$ as $M(\Omega_{cc}) = 3706^{+14}_{-15}\,$MeV. We next calculate the decay width of $T_{ccs}$, based on solely the light-flavor symmetry, as $\Gamma(T_{ccs}) = 42\pm 24$\,MeV.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of neutron-rich Br isotopes and signatures for a prolate-to-oblate shape transition at N=56</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first systematic experimental study of the neutron-rich Br isotopes with two complementary state-of-the-art techniques is presented. These isotopes have been populated in the fission process at two different facilities, GANIL and ILL. New spectroscopic information has been obtained for odd-even $^{87-93}$Br isotopes and the experimental results have been compared with state-of-the-art Large-Scale Shell-Model and DNO Shell-Model calculations. As a result of such theoretical approaches, a transition from prolate ($^{87,89}$Br) to oblate ($^{91,93}$Br) shapes is obtained from the subtle balance between proton and neutron quadrupole deformations, as a clear signature of pseudo-SU3 quadrupole regime.</description>

      <title>New Spin Structure Constraints on Hyperfine Splitting and Proton Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 1S hyperfine splitting in hydrogen is measured to an impressive ppt precision and will soon be measured to ppm precision in muonic hydrogen. The latter measurement will rely on theoretical predictions, which are limited by knowledge of the proton polarizability effect $\Delta_\text{pol}$. Data-driven evaluations of $\Delta_\text{pol}$ have long been in significant tension with baryon chiral perturbation theory. Here we present improved results for $\Delta_\text{pol}$ driven by new spin structure data, reducing the long-standing tension between theory and experiment and halving the dominating uncertainty in hyperfine splitting calculations.</description>

      <title>X(2370) glueball-like particle productions in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the BESIII energy and in pp collisions at the LHC energy with PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII newest observation of X(2370) glueball-like particle, we search its productions in both $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 4.95 GeV and proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV with a parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE. In this model, the final partonic state (FPS) and the final hadronic state (FHS) are consecutively simulated and recorded. The X(2370) glueball- or tetraquark-state is then, respectively, recombined by two gluons or four quarks $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ in the FPS using the quantum statistical mechanics inspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence (DCPC) model. The X(2370) molecular-state is recombined by the baryon-antibaryon of $\Lambda$-$\bar{\Lambda}$ or $\Sigma$-$\bar{\Sigma}$, or by three mesons of $\pi^+\pi^{-}\eta'$, $K^+K^-\eta'$, or $K_S^0K_S^0\eta'$ in the FHS using DCPC model. In both $e^+e^-$ and pp collisions, significant discrepancies in the yields, the transverse momentum spectra and the rapidity distributions among the X(2370) glueball-, tetraquark-, and molecular-state are observed. These discrepancies are proposed as valuable criteria identifying the X(2370) different states from each other. Our results not only support the BESIII observation of glueball-like particle $\rm X(2370)$ production in $e^+e^-$ collisions, but also serve as a prediction for the $\rm X(2370)$ production in pp collisions. We strongly suggest the experimental measurement of the X(2370) glueball-like particle production in pp collisions at the LHC energies.</description>

      <title>The $g^6$ pressure of hot Yang-Mills theory: Canonical form of the integrand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present major progress towards the determination of the last missing piece for the pressure of a Yang-Mills plasma at high temperatures at order $g^6$ in the strong coupling constant. This order is of key importance due to its role in resolving the long-standing infrared problem of finite-temperature field theory within a dimensionally reduced effective field theory setup. By systematically applying linear transformations of integration variables, or momentum shifts, we resolve equivalences between different representations of Feynman sum-integrals. on the integrand level, transforming those into a canonical form. At the order $g^6$, this results in reducing a sum of O(100000) distinct sum-integrals which are produced from all four-loop vacuum diagrams down to merely 21. Furthermore, we succeed to map 11 of those onto known lower-loop structures. This leaves only 10 genuine 4-loop sum-integrals to be evaluated, thereby bringing the finalization of three decades of theoretical efforts within reach.</description>
