      <title>Stochastic portfolio theory with price impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for stochastic portfolio theory (SPT), which incorporates modern nonlinear price impact and impact decay models. Our main result derives the celebrated master formula for additive functional generation of trading strategies in a general high-dimensional market model with price impact. We also develop formulas for an investor's relative wealth with respect to the market portfolio, conditions that guarantee positive observed market prices and derive a stochastic differential equation governing the dynamics of the observed price, investor's holdings and price impact processes. As an application of these results, we develop conditions for relative arbitrage in the price impact setting analogous to previously obtained results for the frictionless setting. Numerical experiments are presented to complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Decentralised Finance and Automated Market Making: Execution and Speculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) are a new prototype of decentralised exchanges which are revolutionising market interactions. The majority of AMMs are constant product markets (CPMs) where exchange rates are set by a trading function. This work studies optimal trading and statistical arbitrage in CPMs where balancing exchange rate risk and execution costs is key. Empirical evidence shows that execution costs are accurately estimated by the convexity of the trading function. These convexity costs are linear in the trade size and are nonlinear in the depth of liquidity and in the exchange rate. We develop models for when exchange rates form in a competing centralised exchange, in a CPM, or in both venues. Finally, we derive computationally efficient strategies that account for stochastic convexity costs and we showcase their out-of-sample performance.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Bernoulli distributions and minimal dependence copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The key result of this paper is to characterize all the multivariate symmetric Bernoulli distributions whose sum is minimal under convex order. In doing so, we automatically characterize extremal negative dependence among Bernoulli random vectors, since multivariate distributions with minimal convex sums are known to be strongly negative dependent. Moreover, beyond its interest per se, this result provides insight into negative dependence within the class of copulas. In particular, two classes of copulas can be built from multivariate symmetric Bernoulli distributions: extremal mixture copulas and FGM copulas. We analyze the extremal negative dependence structures of copulas corresponding to symmetric Bernoulli random vectors with minimal convex sums and explicitly find a class of minimal dependence copulas. Our main results derive from the geometric and algebraic representations of multivariate symmetric Bernoulli distributions, which effectively encode key statistical properties.</description>
