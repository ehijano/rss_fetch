      <title>Wave Packets and Eigenvalue Estimates for Limiting Operators on the Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional spatio-spectral limiting operators \[ T_R := P_{D(R)} B_S P_{D(R)} : L^2(\mathbb{R}^2) \rightarrow L^2(\mathbb{R}^2), \] where $D(R)$ is a disk of radius $R&gt;1$, $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a domain with well-shaped boundary, $P_{D(R)}$ is the orthogonal projection on the subspace of functions supported on $D(R)$, and $B_S$ is the orthogonal projection on the subspace of functions whose Fourier transform is supported on $S$. We construct a disk-adapted wave-packet frame for $L^2(D(R))$ with frame bounds uniform in $R$ using Gevrey-$s$ cutoffs ($s&gt;1$) to obtain near-exponential Fourier localization. Exploiting these localization estimates, we bound the size of the eigenvalue plunge-region for $T_R$ and prove that for each $s&gt;1$ and each $\varepsilon\in(0,1/2)$, \[ \#\{k : \lambda_k(T_R)\in(\varepsilon,1-\varepsilon)\} = O\!\left(R (\log(R/\varepsilon))^{1+2s}\right), \] with constants depending on $s$ and the geometric parameters of $S$. This bound improves existing plunge-region estimates in the classical setting where both domains are disks, when $\varepsilon$ scales like $R^{-\nu}$ for a fixed $\nu &gt; 0$. By an affine transformation, the same result holds if $D(R)$ is a scaled ellipse.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sobolev Spaces and Distributional Spectral Theory for Generalized Aging Operators via Transmutation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral analysis of operators in heterogeneous and aging media typically requires a functional framework that extends beyond the standard Hilbertian setting. In this paper, we establish a rigorous distributional theory for a class of non-local operators, termed Weighted Weyl-Sonine operators, by employing a structure-preserving transmutation method. We construct the Weighted Schwartz Space $\mathcal{S}_{\psi,\omega}$ and its topological dual, the space of Weighted Tempered Distributions $\mathcal{S}'_{\psi,\omega}$, ensuring that the underlying Fr\'echet topology is consistent with the infinitesimal generator of the aging dynamics. This topological foundation allows us to: (i) extend the Weighted Fourier Transform to generalized functions as a unitary isomorphism; (ii) provide an explicit spectral characterization of the weighted Dirac delta $\delta_{\psi,\omega}$ and its scaling laws under geometric dilations; and (iii) introduce a scale of Weighted Sobolev Spaces $H^{s}_{\psi,\omega}$ defined via spectral multipliers. A central result is the derivation of a sharp embedding theorem, $|u(t)| \le C \omega(t)^{-1} \|u\|_{H^s_{\psi,\omega}}$, which rigorously connects abstract spectral energy to the pointwise decay induced by the weight $\omega$. This framework provides a unified geometric characterization of several fractional regimes, including the Hadamard and Riemann-Liouville cases, within a single operator-theoretic architecture.</description>

      <title>New inequalities related to sums of $L^p$ functions in connection with Carbery's problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbery (2006) proposed novel estimates for the $L^p$ norm of a sum of two nonnegative measurable functions. Subsequently, Carlen, Frank, Ivanisvili and Lieb (2018) provided stronger bounds, which Ivanisvili and Mooney (2020) further refined to achieve estimates that are, in a certain sense, optimal. Continuing this line of research, the present work establishes new upper and lower bounds for the range \(p\in(1,\infty)\). Carbery also asked under what conditions on a sequence \((f_j)\) of nonnegative measurable functions the inequality \(\sum \|f_j\|_p^p &lt; \infty\) implies that \(\sum f_j \in L^p\). Ivanisvili and Mooney (2020) resolved this question for \(p\in[1,2]\), and the present work proposes an answer for \(p\in[2,\infty)\).</description>

      <title>On positive automorphisms of algebras of operators on atomic Archimedean vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an Archimedean vector lattice. We investigate subalgebras of $\mathscr{L}(X)$ consisting of regular operators that contain all rank-one operators of the form $a \otimes \varphi_b$, where $a$ and $b$ are atoms of $X$ and $\varphi_b$ denotes the coordinate functional associated with $b$. Our main result shows that every positive automorphism of such a subalgebra contained in $\mathscr{L}(c_{00}(\Lambda))$, is necessarily spatial, meaning that it is implemented by a transformation of the form $$ T \mapsto P D\, T\, D^{-1} P^{-1}, $$ where $P$ is a permutation operator and $D$ is a positive diagonal operator. An important tool for this analysis-one that is also of independent interest-is the Kakutani representation theorem, which we use to establish that every finite-dimensional vector subspace of $X$ is order closed.</description>

      <title>Formalization of non-Archimedean functional analysis 1: spherically complete spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a formalization of spherically complete spaces, which is a fundamental notion in non-archimedean functional analysis. This work includes the equivalent definitions of spherically complete spaces, their basic properties, examples and non-examples such as the field $\mathbf{C}_p$ of $p$-adic complex numbers. As applications, we formalize the Birkhoff-James orthogonality, Hahn-Banach extension theorem and the spherical completion for non-archimedean Banach spaces.

      <description>arXiv:2505.20220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a description of the spectrum of bidual algebra $A^{**}$ of a uniform algebra $A$ we obtain abstract corona theorem for certain uniform algebras. It asserts the density of a specific Gleason part in the spectrum of an $H^\infty$ -- type subalgebra of $A^{**}$.
  There is an isometric isomorphism of the latter subalgebra with $H^\infty(G)$ for a wide class of domains $G\subset\mathbb C^d$. Using abstract corona theorem we show the density of the canonical image of $G$ in the spectrum of $H^\infty(G)$, solving positively corona problem for such domains. In particular, we obtain positive solution for balls and polydisks.</description>

      <title>Resolvent Compositions for Positive Linear Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07251v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolvent compositions were recently introduced as monotonicity-preserving operations that combine a set-valued monotone operator and a bounded linear operator. They generalize in particular the notion of a resolvent average. We analyze the resolvent compositions when the monotone operator is a positive linear operator. We establish several new properties, including L\"owner partial order relations, concavity, and asymptotic behavior. In addition, we show that the resolvent composition operations are nonexpansive with respect to the Thompson metric. We also introduce a new form of geometric interpolation and explore its connections to resolvent compositions. Finally, we study two nonlinear equations based on resolvent compositions.</description>

      <title>Probability measure annihilating all finite-dimensional subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is presumably a folklore result that any infinite-dimensional Banach space admits a probability measure annihilating all finite-dimensional subspaces, as the pushforward measure of an infinite product of Rademacher-type probability measures by a well-chosen random element depending on a linearly independent sequence shows. It also seems to be a generic property of probability measures which are not supported on a finite-dimensional subspace, even when the conditions of the existence of Gaussian measures on the Banach space are not met. In this short article, we provide an original method for constructing such probability measures in all generality using only an atomless probability measure on an interval of $\mathbb{R}$ instead of infinite-product measures. Anecdotally, prime numbers and one of their distribution laws are used. In the process, we show the existence of an uncountable measurable family of independent vectors having the cardinality of the continuum in any infinite-dimensional Banach space.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-differential operators associated with the gyrator transform on modulation spaces with Shubin-type symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of pseudo-differential operators associated with the gyrator transform on modulation spaces. The gyrator transform is a two-dimensional linear canonical transform which can be viewed as a rotation in the time-frequency plane and is closely related to the fractional Fourier transform. Motivated by the global structure of the gyrator kernel, we work with Shubin global symbol classes on $\mathbb{R}^4$. We first recall basic properties of modulation spaces and establish continuity and invertibility of the gyrator transform on these spaces, using its representation as a metaplectic operator. Then we introduce pseudo-differential operators defined via the gyrator transform and a Shubin symbol, and we prove boundedness results on modulation spaces and on gyrator-based modulation-Sobolev spaces. Our work extends and generalises earlier results of Mahato, Arya and Prasad on Schwartz and Sobolev spaces \cite{MahatoGyrator} to the more flexible framework of modulation spaces.</description>

      <title>SG-Hankel Pseudo-Differential Operators on Weighted Gelfand-Shilov Type Spaces and a Numerical Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of SG pseudo-differential operators associated with the Hankel transform on a family of weighted Gelfand--Shilov type spaces of radial functions. First, we recall basic properties of the Hankel transform of order $\nu&gt;-1/2$ and define a convenient Gelfand--Shilov type space $W_{\alpha,\beta}$ which is invariant under the Hankel transform and stable under differentiation and multiplication by powers of the radial variable. Then we define the SG--Hankel symbol class $S^{m_1,m_2}_H$ and the corresponding pseudo-differential operator \[ (T_\sigma f)(x)=\int_0^\infty \sigma(x,\lambda)J_\nu(x\lambda)\widehat f_H(\lambda)\,\lambda\,d\lambda. \] We prove that $T_\sigma$ is continuous on $W_{\alpha,\beta}$, and under additional decay assumptions on the symbol, we obtain compactness results between different weighted spaces. Minimal and maximal realisations of $T_\sigma$ in $L^2((0,\infty),x\, dx)$ are studied in detail, and a weak solvability result for the SG--Hankel pseudo-differential equation $T_\sigma f=g$ is derived. Finally, we present a numerical example for a simple SG symbol and a Gaussian input, illustrating the spatial decay predicted by the theory.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-differential operators associated with the fractional Hankel-Bessel transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of pseudo-differential operators associated with a fractional Hankel--Bessel transform. Motivated by the classical Hankel transform and the pseudo-differential operators associated with Bessel operators studied by Pathak and Pandey \cite{PathakPandey1995}, we define a fractional variant by inserting a fractional Fourier-type phase into the Hankel kernel. We then introduce global Shubin-type symbol classes adapted to this transform, derive kernel estimates and integral representations, and establish boundedness results on weighted L^{p}-spaces and on fractional Hankel--Sobolev spaces. This provides a new framework parallel to the classical Hankel pseudo-differential calculus, but in a fractional and global setting.</description>

      <title>CLT for $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights, application to the KLS conjecture in Schatten balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the $\beta$-ensembles (or 1D log-gas) with Freud weights, namely with a potential of the form $|x|^{p}$ with $p \geq 2$. Since this potential is not of class $\mathcal{C}^{3}$ when $p \in (2,3]$, most of the literature does not apply. In this singular setting, we prove a central limit theorem for linear statistics with general test-functions. Our strategy relies on establishing an optimal local law in the spirit of [Bourgade, Mody, Pain 22'. Our results allow us to give a consistency check of the KLS conjecture for the uniform distributions on $p$-Schatten balls and the functions $f(X)=\mathrm{Tr}\left(X^r\right)^q$. While the case $p&gt;3$, $q=1$, $r=2$ was proven in [Dadoun, Fradelizi, Gu\'edon, Zitt 23'], we address in the present paper the case $p\geq2$, $q\geq1$ and $r\geq2$ an even integer. The proofs are based on a link between the moments of norms of uniform laws on $p$-Schatten balls and the $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights.</description>

      <title>Spectral norm of matrices with independent entries up to polyloglog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the expectation of the operator norm of the random matrix (a_{ij} X_{ij}) for i,j &lt;= n, under the assumption that the random variables (X_{ij}) are independent, symmetric and satisfy the moment growth condition ||X_{ij}||{2p} &lt;= C ||X_{ij}||{p} for every p &gt;= 1. We derive an upper bound expressed in terms of quantities that can be explicitly computed in many cases. This bound implies a two-sided estimate, up to a factor given by a power of an iterated logarithm. This factor is considerably smaller than the natural scale of the problem. Our result thus provides positive evidence supporting a conjecture formulated by Rafal Latala and Jan Swiatkowski.</description>
