      <title>Optimized Flow Control based on Automatic Differentiation in Compressible Turbulent Channel Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an automatic differentiation (AD)-based optimization framework for flow control in compressible turbulent channel flows. We developed a fully differentiable boundary condition framework that allows for the precise calculation of gradients with respect to boundary control variables. This facilitates the efficient optimization of flow control methods. The framework's adaptability and effectiveness are demonstrated using two boundary conditions: opposition control and tunable permeable walls. Various optimization targets are evaluated, including wall friction and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), across different time horizons. In each optimization, there were around $4\times10^4$ control variables and $3\times10^{9}$ state variables in a single episode. Results indicate that TKE-targeted opposition control achieves a more stable and significant reduction in drag, with effective suppression of turbulence throughout the channel. In contrast, strategies that focus directly on minimizing wall friction were found to be less effective, exhibiting instability and increased turbulence in the outer region. The tunable permeable walls also show potential to achieve stable drag reduction through a `flux-inducing' mechanism. This study demonstrates the advantages of AD-based optimization in complex flow control scenarios and provides physical insight into the choice of quantity of interest for improved optimization performance.</description>

      <title>On-demand microfluidic droplet pinching and splitting under local confinement gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the pinching of an elongated liquid droplet that is confined in a rectangular microchannel. The droplet pinching is induced by a local variation of the channel topography and can lead to its break-up. The modification of the channel topography is either induced by a reversible local dilation of the channel bottom wall or by a confinement gradient that is irreversibly modelled in the channel. Interestingly, in both cases, a few micrometres contraction of the channel height leads to the pinching of the droplet in the direction of the channel width. If this pinching is such that the droplet is no longer confined at the level of its deformation, {\it i.e.} the liquid thread becomes 3D, the droplet splits in two. By minimizing the surface energy of the droplet under the channel confinement gradient, we are able to predict its pinching or its break-up, if any. The dynamic of the droplet deformation is then captured by a semi-analytical model, assuming that most of the viscous dissipation is located in the gutters at the four corners of the channel. Conversely, we show that this kinetic model can be used to extract the average topographic variation of the channel, down to few micrometers, by measuring the droplet pinching dynamics under a classical optical microscope.</description>

      <title>3D Pore-Scale Mixing Interface Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective mixing behavior of solutes in porous media is fundamentally connected to the development of a local mixing interface between the two initial solutions, which is characterized by a complex lamellar structure. The deformation of the interface is controlled by the interplay of advection and diffusion, which generate the mechanisms of lamella stretching and shrinking, respectively. Based on the results of pore-scale numerical simulations, we develop a mechanistic single parabolic lamella model (SPLM) to capture the interface evolution across various temporal and P\'eclet number scales. The model shows near-perfect agreement with a 2D parallel plates scenario and promising results for a 3D porous medium. The SPLM model also establishes P\'eclet regimes for the equilibrium area and temporal regimes for the transient behavior of the interface. These findings represent a step forward towards eventually incorporating mixing limitation into general macroscopic reactive transport models.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of dynamic models for gravity-driven particle-laden flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of viscous thin-film particle-laden flows down inclined surfaces are commonly modeled with one of two approaches: a diffusive flux model or a suspension balance model. The diffusive flux model assumes that the particles migrate via a diffusive flux induced by gradients in both the particle concentration and the effective suspension viscosity. The suspension balance model introduces non-Newtonian bulk stress with shear-induced normal stresses, the gradients of which cause particle migration. Both models have appeared in the literature of particle-laden flow with virtually no comparison between the two models. For particle-laden viscous flow on an incline, in a thin-film geometry, one can use lubrication theory to derive a compact dynamic model in the form of a $2\times 2$ system of conservation laws. We can then directly compare the two theories side by side by looking at similarities and differences in the flux functions for the conservation laws, and in exact and numerical simulations of the equations. We compare the flux profiles over a range of parameters, showing fairly good agreement between the models, with the biggest difference involving the behavior at the free surface. We also consider less dense suspensions at lower inclination angles where the dynamics involve two shock waves that can be clearly measured in experiments. In this context the solutions differ by no more than about 10%, suggesting that either model could be used for this configuration.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium theory of bidensity particle-laden suspensions in thin-film flow down a spiral separator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral gravity separators are designed to separate multi-species slurry components based on differences in density and size. Previous studies have investigated steady-state solutions for mixtures of liquids and single particle species in thin-film flows. However, these models are constrained to single-species systems and cannot describe the dynamics of multi-species separation. In contrast, our analysis extends to mixtures containing two particle species of differing densities, revealing that they undergo radial separation, which is an essential mechanism for practical applications in separating particles of varying densities. This work models gravity-driven bidensity slurries in a spiral trough by incorporating particle interactions, using empirically derived formulas for particle fluxes from previous bidensity studies on inclined planes. Specifically, we study a thin-film bidensity slurry flowing down a rectangular channel helically wound around a vertical axis. Through a thin-film approximation, we derive equilibrium profiles for the concentration of each particle species and the fluid depth. Additionally, we analyze the influence of key design parameters, such as spiral radius and channel width, on particle concentration profiles. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing spiral separator designs for enhanced applicability and adaptability.</description>

      <title>High-resolution pressure imaging via background-oriented schlieren tomography: a spatiotemporal measurement for MHz ultrasound fields and hydrophone calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the spatiotemporal pressure field of MHz-focused ultrasound is measured using a background-oriented schlieren technique combined with fast checkerboard demodulation and vector tomography (VT-BOS). Hydrophones have been commonly employed to directly measure the local pressure in underwater ultrasound. However, their limitations include that they disturb the acoustic field and affect the measured pressure through the spatial averaging effect. To overcome such limitations, we propose VT-BOS as a non-contact technique for acoustic field measurements using only a background image and a camera. In our experiments, VT-BOS measures focused acoustic fields with a focal width of 1.0 mm and a frequency of 4.55 MHz, capturing traveling, reflected, and standing waves. We discuss three key features of this approach:(1) the temporal evolution of pressure measured by VT-BOS and hydrophones, (2) the differences in computational cost and spatial resolution between VT-BOS and other techniques, and (3) the measurement range of VT-BOS. The results demonstrate that VT-BOS successfully quantifies spatiotemporal acoustic fields and can estimate the hydrophones' spatial averaging effect over a finite area. VT-BOS measures pressure fields of several MPa with high spatiotemporal resolution, requiring less computational and measurement time. It is used to measure pressure amplitudes from 0.4 to 6.4 MPa, with the potential to extend the range to 0.3 ~ 201.6 MPa by adjusting the background-to-target distance. VT-BOS is a promising tool for measuring acoustic pressure in the MHz and MPa ranges, critical for applications such as vessel flow measurement and hydrophone calibration.</description>

      <title>A method for evaluating relations of turbulent normal-stresses by experimental data over a wide range of Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Nagib et al (2024} utilized indicator functions of profiles of the streamwise normal stress to reveal the ranges of validity, in wall distance and Reynolds number, for each of two proposed models in Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of channel and pipe flows. A method more suited to experimental data is proposed here, as establishing accurate indicator functions is a challenge. The new method is outlined and used with the two leading models that propose either a logarithmic or power trend, for the normal stresses of turbulence in a fitting region of wall-bounded flows. The method, which is simple and robust, is used to evaluate each model over a wide range of Reynolds numbers by applying it to two of the prominent experimental data sets in zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers (ZPG) and pipe flows. A somewhat larger exponent for the power trend equal to 0.28, instead of 0.25, is found to slightly extend its range of validity. Correcting for outer intermittency in ZPG data also extends validity of the power trend to around half the boundary layer thickness. Projecting near-wall peak normal-stress values using both models based on data from locations in the fitting region, yields nearly identical results up to the highest Re available from these two experiments. The two relations provide projected values at Re=10M with a relative difference of approximately 4.5%; distinguishing between these values would require measurement accuracy well beyond our capabilities. Current results and those of Monkewitz and Nagib (2023) and Baxerras et al. (2024) on the mean flow, suggest that considerations of nonlinear growth of eddies from the wall and accounting for some viscous effects, are important for modeling wall-bounded flows. Such effects also apply to potential refinements of the logarithmic trend along ideas advanced by Deshpande et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Thrust in Flapping Airfoils Through Wake Interactions with Oscillating Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the natural motion of insects, fish, and other animals, flapping airfoils have gained significant importance due to their applications in fields such as ship propulsion, micro aerial vehicles, and autonomous underwater vehicles. Over the past two decades, extensive research has focused on understanding the dynamics of these airfoils, their thrust production capabilities, and methods to enhance this thrust in unsteady flows. This study investigates how the presence of a cylinder oscillating due to incoming flow affects the thrust performance of the flapping airfoil. The results indicate that the flapping airfoil generates increased thrust when placed in the wake of the oscillating cylinder compared to a scenario without the cylinder's wake. A direct relationship has been found between the strouhal number ($St$) of the flapping airfoil and its pitching amplitude, which significantly influences the airfoil's performance. This analysis highlights the potential for optimizing flapping airfoil efficiency through strategic selection of flapping parameters and the placement of an oscillating cylinder.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Reconstruction of Gappy Lagrangian Turbulent Signals by Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stochastic method for reconstructing missing spatial and velocity data along the trajectories of small objects passively advected by turbulent flows with a wide range of temporal or spatial scales, such as small balloons in the atmosphere or drifters in the ocean. Our approach makes use of conditional generative diffusion models, a recently proposed data-driven machine learning technique. We solve the problem for two paradigmatic open problems, the case of 3D tracers in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, and 2D trajectories from the NOAA-funded Global Drifter Program. We show that for both cases, our method is able to reconstruct velocity signals retaining non-trivial scale-by-scale properties that are highly non-Gaussian and intermittent. A key feature of our method is its flexibility in dealing with the location and shape of data gaps, as well as its ability to naturally exploit correlations between different components, leading to superior accuracy, with respect to Gaussian process regressions, for both pointwise reconstruction and statistical expressivity. Our method shows promising applications also to a wide range of other Lagrangian problems, including multi-particle dispersion in turbulence, dynamics of charged particles in astrophysics and plasma physics, and pedestrian dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical action of various kinds of waves have been known for several centuries. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and torques emerged at the end of the 19th / beginning of the 20th centuries, with the development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular momentum. A second tide appeared in the past several decades, connected to technological breakthroughs: the creation of lasers and the controlled generation of structured wavefields. This resulted in several important discoveries: optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic to micro sizes, as well as acoustic and acoustofluidic manipulation and sorting of larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Here we provide a unifying review of optical and acoustic forces and torques on various particles, addressing both their theoretical fundamentals and the main applications. Our approach employs the universal connection between the local energy, momentum, and spin densities in the wave fields and the principal forces and torques on small Rayleigh particles. Moreover, we describe the most important cases of nontrivial forces and complex particles: lateral and pulling forces, chiral and anisotropic particles, etc. We also describe the main experimental achievements and applications related to optical and acoustic forces and torques in structured wave fields. Our goal is to illuminate the common fundamental origin and close interconnections between the mechanical actions of optical and acoustic fields, in order to facilitate their profound understanding and the further development of optomechanical and acoustomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Volumetric lattice Boltzmann method for thermal particulate flows with conjugate heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A volumetric lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is developed for the particle-resolved direct numerical simulation of thermal particulate flows with conjugate heat transfer. This method is devised as a single-domain approach by applying the volumetric interpretation of the LB equation and introducing a solid fraction field to represent the particle. The volumetric LB scheme is employed to enforce the nonslip velocity condition in the solid domain, and a specialized momentum exchange scheme is proposed to calculate the hydrodynamic force and torque acting on the particle. To uniformly solve the temperature field over the entire domain with high numerical fidelity, an energy conservation equation is first derived by reformulating the convection term into a source term. A corresponding LB equation is then devised to automatically achieve the conjugate heat transfer condition and correctly handle the differences in thermophysical properties. Theoretical analysis of this LB equation is also performed to derive the constraints to preserve the numerical fidelity even near the solid-fluid interface. Numerical tests are first performed to validate the present volumetric LB method in various aspects. Then, the sedimentation of a cold particle with conjugate heat transfer in a long channel is investigated. It is found that the sedimentation process can be divided into the accelerating, decelerating, and equilibrium stages. As a further application to dense particulate flows, the sedimentation of 2048 cold particles with conjugate heat transfer in a square cavity is simulated. The particulate Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection is successfully captured in this particle-resolved simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate perturbations in a rotational and incompressible fluid flow. Interested in the phenomenon analogous to the black hole ergoregion instability, we verify the influence of the vorticity in the instability associated with this fluid system, in the presence of a region in which the fluid flow velocity is greater than the speed of the perturbation. With this aim, we compute the quasinormal modes of the system, using two different numerical methods, obtaining an excellent numerical agreement between them. We find that the vorticity tends to diminish the ergoregion instability of the system.</description>

      <title>Changing the flow profile and resulting drying pattern of dispersion droplets via contact angle modification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spilling tea or coffee leads to a tell-tale circular stain after the droplet dries, known as the "coffee ring effect". The evaporation of suspension droplets is a complex physical process, and predicting and controlling the particle deposit patterns from sessile droplet evaporation are essential for many industrial processes, such as ink-jet printing and crop-care applications. In this article, we systematically investigate the effect of surface wettability on the evaporation dynamics of a particle-laden droplet, focussing on the contact line stick-slip behaviour, the hydrodynamic flow of the suspended particles, and the resulting particle deposit after evaporation. We use substrates with different wettabilities, ranging from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, and quantify the internal flow during the evaporation by tracking (fluorescent) tracer particles. We find that the internal flow shifts from a predominantly outward flow towards the contact line for low contact angles to an inward flow for large contact angles. Correspondingly, the particle deposit transitions from the typical coffee-ring pattern to a central stain as the substrates's hydrophobicity increases. Finally, we corroborate these experimental findings with dynamic density functional theory, modelling the droplet evaporation process and stick-slip behaviour of the contact line. Our investigation suggests that the wettability of the substrate can significantly alter hydrodynamic flow within drying droplets, thereby affecting the resulting particle deposit.</description>

      <title>A Priori Uncertainty Quantification of Reacting Turbulence Closure Models using Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While many physics-based closure model forms have been posited for the sub-filter scale (SFS) in large eddy simulation (LES), vast amounts of data available from direct numerical simulation (DNS) create opportunities to leverage data-driven modeling techniques. Albeit flexible, data-driven models still depend on the dataset and the functional form of the model chosen. Increased adoption of such models requires reliable uncertainty estimates both in the data-informed and out-of-distribution regimes. In this work, we employ Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to capture both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in a reacting flow model. In particular, we model the filtered progress variable scalar dissipation rate which plays a key role in the dynamics of turbulent premixed flames. We demonstrate that BNN models can provide unique insights about the structure of uncertainty of the data-driven closure models. We also propose a method for the incorporation of out-of-distribution information in a BNN. The efficacy of the model is demonstrated by a priori evaluation on a dataset consisting of a variety of flame conditions and fuels.</description>

      <title>Role of surfactants on droplet formation in piezoacoustic inkjet printing across microsecond-to-second timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In piezo acoustic drop-on-demand inkjet printing a single droplet is produced for each piezo driving pulse. This droplet is typically multicomponent, including surfactants to control the spreading and drying of the droplet on the substrate. However, the role of these surfactants on the droplet formation process remains rather elusive. Surfactant concentration gradients may manifest across microsecond-to-second timescales, spanning both the rapid ejection of ink from the nozzle exit and the comparatively slower idling timescale governing the firing of successive droplets. In the present work, we study the influence of surfactants on droplet formation across 6 orders of magnitude in time. To this end, we visualize the microsecond droplet formation process using stroboscopic laser-induced fluorescence microscopy while we vary the nozzle idle time. Our results show that increasing the idle time up to O(1) s affects only the break-up dynamics of the inkjet but not its velocity. By contrast, for idle times $&gt;$ O(1) s, both the break-up dynamics are altered and the velocity of the inkjet increases. We show that the increased velocity results from a decreased surface tension of the ejected droplet, which we extracted from the observed shape oscillations of the jetted droplets in flight. The measured decrease in surface tension is surprising as the $\mu$s timescale of droplet formation is much faster than the typical ms-to-s timescale of surfactant adsorption. By varying the bulk surfactant concentration, we show that the fast decrease in surface tension results from a local surfactant concentration increase to more than 200 times the CMC. Our results suggest that a local high concentration of surfactant allows for surfactant adsorption to the interface of an inkjet at the $\mu$s-to-ms timescale, which is much faster than the typical ms-to-s timescale of surfactant adsorption.</description>

      <title>A gas-surface interaction algorithm for discrete velocity methods in predicting rarefied and multi-scale flows: For Cercignani-Lampis boundary model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrete velocity method (DVM) for rarefied flows and unified methods based on the DVM framework for flows in all regimes have worked well as precise flow solvers over the past decades and have been successfully extended to other important physical fields. However, these methods primarily focus on modeling gas-gas interactions. For gas-surface interactions (GSI) at the wall boundary, they usually use the full accommodation diffuse reflection model, which cannot accurately describe the behavior of reflected gas molecules in rarefied flows. To overcome this bottleneck and extend the DVM and unified methods to more realistic boundary conditions, a Cercignani-Lampis (CL) boundary with different momentum and thermal energy accommodations is proposed and integrated into the DVM framework. In this work, by giving the macroscopic flux from the numerical quadrature of the incident molecular distribution, the reflected macroscopic flux can be obtained for the given accommodation coefficients. Then, an anisotropic Gaussian distribution can be found for the reflected molecules, whose parameters are determined by the calculated reflected macroscopic flux. These macroscopic flux and microscopic Gaussian distribution form a complete physical process for the reflected molecules. Furthermore, the CL boundary is integrated into the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), making it suitable for the simulation of both monatomic and diatomic gas flows, and it accommodates both the conventional Cartesian velocity space and the recently developed efficient unstructured velocity space. Moreover, this new GSI boundary is suitable for both explicit and implicit schemes, offering better performance for flow prediction. Finally, the performance of the new boundary is validated through a series of numerical tests covering a wide range of Knudsen and Mach numbers.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Rotating Wall-Mode Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly rotating limit, we derive a balanced set of reduced equations governing the strongly nonlinear development of the convective wall-mode instability in the interior of a general container. The model illustrates that wall-mode convection is a multiscale phenomenon where the dynamics of the bulk interior diagnostically determine the small-scale dynamics within Stewartson boundary layers at the sidewalls. The sidewall boundary layers feedback on the interior via a nonlinear lateral heat-flux boundary condition, providing a closed system. Outside the asymptotically thin boundary layer, the convective modes connect to a dynamical interior that maintains scales set by the domain geometry. In many ways, the final system of equations resembles boundary-forced planetary geostrophic baroclinic dynamics coupled with barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity. The reduced system contains the results from previous linear instability theory but captured in an elementary fashion, providing a new avenue for investigating wall-mode convection in the strongly nonlinear regime. We also derive the dominant Ekman-flux correction to the onset Rayleigh number for large Taylor number, Ra ~ 31.8 Ta^(1/2) - 4.43 Ta^(5/12) for no-slip boundaries. We demonstrate some of the reduced model's nonlinear dynamics with numerical simulations in a cylindrical container.</description>

      <title>A dispersive effective equation for transverse propagation of planar shallow water waves over periodic bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of shallow water waves propagating over bathymetry that varies periodically in one direction and is constant in the other. Plane waves traveling along the constant direction are known to evolve into solitary waves, due to an effective dispersion. We apply multiple-scale perturbation theory to derive an effective constant-coefficient system of Boussinesq-type equations that not only accurately describe these waves but also predict their full two-dimensional shape in some detail. Numerical experiments confirm the good agreement between the effective equations and the variable-bathymetry shallow water equations.</description>
