      <title>Identification of phase correlations in Financial Stock Market Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basis of arbitrage methods depends on the circulation of information within the framework of the financial market. Following the work of Modigliani and Miller, it has become a vital part of discussions related to the study of financial networks and predictions. The emergence of the efficient market hypothesis by Fama, Fisher, Jensen and Roll in the early 1970s opened up the door for discussion of information affecting the price in the market and thereby creating asymmetries and price distortion. Whenever the micro and macroeconomic factors change, there is a high probability of information asymmetry in the market, and this asymmetry of information creates turbulence in the market. The analysis and interpretation of turbulence caused by the differences in information is crucial in understanding the nature of the stock market using price patterns and fluctuations. Even so, the traditional approaches are not capable of analyzing the cyclical price fluctuations outside the realm of wave structures of securities prices, and a proper and effective technique to assess the nature of the Financial market. Consequently, the analysis of the price fluctuations by applying the theories and computational techniques of mathematical physics ensures that such cycles are disintegrated, and the outcome of decomposed cycles is elucidated to understand the impression of the information on the genesis and discovery of price and to assess the nature of stock market turbulence. In this regard, the paper will provide a framework of Spectrum analysis that decomposes the pricing patterns and is capable of determining the pricing behavior, eventually assisting in examining the nature of turbulence in the National Stock Exchange of India.</description>

      <title>Dichography: Two-frame Ultrafast Imaging from a Single Diffraction Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright, ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies. When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets, imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot. The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.</description>

      <title>Distinct weak asymmetric interactions shape human brain functions as probability fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data. Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.</description>

      <title>Extreme Learning Machine for the Characterization of Anomalous Diffusion from Single Trajectories (AnDi-ELM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the dynamics of natural and artificial systems has provided several examples of deviations from Brownian behavior, generally defined as anomalous diffusion. The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions between Accuracy Regimes in L2 regularized Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasing the L2 regularization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) causes a first-order phase transition into the under-parametrized phase -- the so-called onset-of learning. We explain this transition via the scalar (Ricci) curvature of the error landscape. We predict new transition points as the data complexity is increased and, in accordance with the theory of phase transitions, the existence of hysteresis effects. We confirm both predictions numerically. Our results provide a natural explanation of the recently discovered phenomenon of '\emph{grokking}' as DNN models getting stuck in a local minimum of the error surface, corresponding to a lower accuracy phase. Our work paves the way for new probing methods of the intrinsic structure of DNNs in and beyond the L2 context.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks offer a powerful framework for modeling complex systems across diverse domains, effectively capturing multiple types of connections and interdependent subsystems commonly found in real world scenarios. To analyze these networks, embedding techniques that project nodes into a lower-dimensional geometric space are essential. This paper introduces a novel hyperbolic embedding framework that advances the state of the art in multilayer network analysis. Our method, which supports heterogeneous node sets across networks and inter-layer connections, generates layer-specific hyperbolic embeddings, enabling detailed intra-layer analysis and inter-layer comparisons, while simultaneously preserving the global multilayer structure within hyperbolic space, a capability that sets it apart from existing approaches, which typically rely on independent embedding of layers. Through experiments on synthetic multilayer stochastic block models, we demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves community structure, even when layers consist of different node sets. When applied to real brain networks, the method successfully clusters disease-related brain regions from different patients, outperforming layer-independent approaches and highlighting its relevance for comparative analysis. Overall, this work provides a robust tool for multilayer network analysis, enhancing interpretability and offering new insights into the structure and function of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Using Diffusion Models to do Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in machine learning (ML) methods for geophysical modeling has raised the question of how these methods might be applied to data assimilation (DA). We focus on diffusion modeling (a form of generative artificial intelligence) for systems that can perform the entire DA process, rather than on ML-based tools used within a conventional DA system. We identify at least three distinct types of diffusion-based DA systems and show that they differ in the posterior distribution they target for sampling. These posterior distributions correspond to different priors and/or likelihoods, which in turn result in unique training datasets, computational requirements, and state estimate qualities. Our analysis further shows that a diffusion DA system designed to target the same posterior distribution as current ensemble DA algorithms requires re-training at each DA cycle, which is computationally costly. We discuss the implications of these findings for the use of diffusion modeling in DA.</description>
