      <title>Detail Across Scales: Multi-Scale Enhancement for Full Spectrum Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a compact and parametric alternative to discrete array-based data representations, encoding information directly in neural network weights to enable resolution-independent representation and memory efficiency. However, existing INR approaches, when constrained to compact network sizes, struggle to faithfully represent the multi-scale structures, high-frequency information, and fine textures that characterize the majority of scientific datasets. To address this limitation, we propose WIEN-INR, a wavelet-informed implicit neural representation that distributes modeling across different resolution scales and employs a specialized kernel network at the finest scale to recover subtle details. This multi-scale architecture allows for the use of smaller networks to retain the full spectrum of information while preserving the training efficiency and reducing storage cost. Through extensive experiments on diverse scientific datasets spanning different scales and structural complexities, WIEN-INR achieves superior reconstruction fidelity while maintaining a compact model size. These results demonstrate WIEN-INR as a practical neural representation framework for high-fidelity scientific data encoding, extending the applicability of INRs to domains where efficient preservation of fine detail is essential.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Entanglement's Metrological Power: Empirical Modeling of Optimal States in Quantum Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using extensive numerical analysis of 20,000 randomly generated two-qubit states, we provide a quantitative analysis of the connection between entanglement measures and Maximized Quantum Fisher Information (MQFI). Our systematic study shows strong empirical relationships between the metrological capacity of quantum states and three different entanglement measures: concurrence, negativity, and relative entropy of entanglement. We show that optimization over local unitary transformations produces substantially more predictable relationships than fixed-generator quantum Fisher information approaches using sophisticated statistical analysis, such as bootstrap resampling, systematic data binning, and multiple model comparisons. With exponential fits reaching $R^2 &gt; 0.99$ and polynomial models reaching $R^2 = 0.999$, we offer thorough empirical support for saturation behavior in quantum metrological advantage. With immediate applications to realworld quantum sensing protocols, our findings directly empirically validate important predictions from quantum resource theory and set fundamental bounds for quantum sensor optimization and resource allocation. These intricate relationships are quantitatively described by the polynomial and exponential fit equations, which offer crucial real-world direction for the design of quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Interventional Causality into Synergistic, Redundant, and Unique Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for decomposing interventional causal effects into synergistic, redundant, and unique components, building on the intuition of Partial Information Decomposition (PID) and the principle of M\"obius inversion. While recent work has explored a similar decomposition of an observational measure, we argue that a proper causal decomposition must be interventional in nature. We develop a mathematical approach that systematically quantifies how causal power is distributed among variables in a system, using a recently derived closed-form expression for the M\"obius function of the redundancy lattice. The formalism is then illustrated by decomposing the causal power in logic gates, cellular automata, chemical reaction networks, and a transformer language model. Our results reveal how the distribution of causal power can be context- and parameter-dependent. The decomposition provides new insights into complex systems by revealing how causal influences are shared and combined among multiple variables, with potential applications ranging from attribution of responsibility in legal or AI systems, to the analysis of biological networks or climate models.</description>

      <title>On the role of symmetry and geometry in global quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global quantum sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary ranges with a finite number of measurements. Among the various existing formulations, the Bayesian paradigm stands as a flexible approach for optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. Within this paradigm, however, there are two fundamentally different ways to capture prior ignorance and uninformed estimation; namely, requiring invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, or adhering to the geometry of a state space. In this paper we carefully examine the practical consequences of both the invariance-based and the geometry-based approaches, and show how to apply them in relevant examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy settings. We find that, while the invariance-based approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive scenarios, the geometry-based one can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. Crucially, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we are able to unify the two formulations into a single practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed to tackle any given estimation task. We thus provide a blueprint for the design of novel high-precision quantum sensors.</description>
