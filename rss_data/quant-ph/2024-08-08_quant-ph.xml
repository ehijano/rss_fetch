      <title>Finding quantum partial assignments by search-to-decision reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computer science, many search problems are reducible to decision problems, which implies that finding a solution is as hard as deciding whether a solution exists. A quantum analogue of search-to-decision reductions would be to ask whether a quantum algorithm with access to a $\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle can construct $\mathsf{QMA}$ witnesses as quantum states. By a result from Irani, Natarajan, Nirkhe, Rao, and Yuen (CCC '22), it is known that this does not hold relative to a quantum oracle, unlike the cases of $\mathsf{NP}$, $\mathsf{MA}$, and $\mathsf{QCMA}$ where search-to-decision relativizes. We prove that if one is not interested in the quantum witness as a quantum state but only in terms of its partial assignments, i.e. the reduced density matrices, then there exists a classical polynomial-time algorithm with access to a $\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle that outputs approximations of the density matrices of a near-optimal quantum witness, for any desired constant locality and inverse polynomial error. Our construction is based on a circuit-to-Hamiltonian mapping that approximately preserves near-optimal $\mathsf{QMA}$ witnesses and a new $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete problem, Low-energy Density Matrix Verification, which is called by the $\mathsf{QMA}$ oracle to adaptively construct approximately consistent density matrices of a low-energy state.</description>

      <title>Double-bracket quantum algorithms for high-fidelity ground state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground state preparation is a key area where quantum computers are expected to prove advantageous. Double-bracket quantum algorithms (DBQAs) have been recently proposed to diagonalize Hamiltonians and in this work we show how to use them to prepare ground states. We propose to improve an initial state preparation by adding a few steps of DBQAs. The interfaced method systematically achieves a better fidelity while significantly reducing the computational cost of the procedure. For a Heisenberg model, we compile our algorithm using CZ and single-qubit gates into circuits that match capabilities of near-term quantum devices. Moreover, we show that DBQAs can benefit from the experimental availability of increasing circuit depths. Whenever an approximate ground state can be prepared without exhausting the available circuit depth, then DBQAs can be enlisted to algorithmically seek a higher fidelity preparation.</description>

      <title>Reducing Depth and Measurement Weights in Pauli-based Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pauli-based computation (PBC) is a universal measurement-based quantum computation model steered by an adaptive sequence of independent and compatible Pauli measurements on separable magic-state qubits. Here, we propose several new ways of decreasing the weight of the Pauli measurements and their associated \textsc{cnot} complexity; we also demonstrate how to reduce this model's computational depth. Inspired by known state-transfer methods, we introduce incPBC, a universal model for quantum computation requiring a larger number of (now incompatible) Pauli measurements of weight at most 2. For usual PBC, we prove new upper bounds on the required weights and computational depth, obtained via a pre-compilation step. We also propose a heuristic algorithm that can contribute reductions of over 30\% to the average weight of Pauli measurements (and associated \textsc{cnot} count) when simulating and compiling Clifford-dominated random quantum circuits with up to 22 $T$ gates and over 20\% for instances with larger $T$ counts.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty of Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty of a quantum state is given by the composition of two components. The first is called the quantum component and is given by the probability distribution of an observable relative to the state. The second is the classical component which is an uncertainty function that is applied to the first component. We characterize uncertainty functions in terms of four axioms. We then study four examples called variance, entropy, geometric and sine uncertainty functions. The final section presents the general theory of state uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Linear Circuit Synthesis using Weighted Steiner Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CNOT circuits are a common building block of general quantum circuits. The problem of synthesizing and optimizing such circuits has received a lot of attention in the quantum computing literature. This problem is especially challenging for quantum devices with restricted connectivity, where two-qubit gates can only be placed between adjacent qubits. The state-of-the-art algorithms for optimizing the number of CNOT gates are heuristic algorithms that are based on Gaussian elimination and that use Steiner trees to connect between different subsets of qubits. In this article, we suggest considering weighted Steiner trees, and we present a simple low-cost heuristic to compute weights. The simulated evaluation shows that the suggested heuristic is almost always beneficial and reduces the number of CNOT gates by up to 10%.</description>

      <title>Energy additivity as a requirement for universal quantum thermodynamical frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to develop a general framework for thermodynamics in the regime of strong coupling and correlations between subsystems of an autonomous quantum "universe" has entailed diverging definitions for basic quantities, including internal energy. While most approaches focus solely on the system of interest, we propose that a universal notion of internal energy should also account for the environment in order to keep consistency with the closed-system energy of the universe. As an illustration, we study a particular two-qubit universe model, obtaining the exact master equations for both parties and calculating their effective Hamiltonians and internal energies as given by the recently devised minimal dissipation approach. In this case, we show that internal energies are not additive, which leads to unphysical features. Finally, we introduce an abstract framework to describe all effective Hamiltonian-based approaches and address a rigorous definition of energy additivity in this context, in both a weak and a strong forms, discussing the underlying subtleties.</description>

      <title>Linear-optical quantum computation with arbitrary error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-rate quantum error correcting codes mitigate the imposing scale of fault-tolerant quantum computers but require the efficient generation of non-local many-body entanglement. We provide a linear-optical architecture with these properties, compatible with arbitrary codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits on generic lattices, and featuring a natural way to leverage physical noise bias. Simulations involving hyperbolic surface codes, promising quantum low-density parity-check codes, reveal a threshold comparable to the 2D surface code at about a ten-fold improvement in encoding rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we uncover the intrinsic information processes in non-Hermitian quantum systems and their thermodynamic effects. We demonstrate that these systems can exhibit negative entropy production, making them potential candidates for information engines. We also identify a key informational quantity that can characterize phase transitions beyond the reach of traditional partition functions. This work enhances our understanding of the interplay between information and thermodynamics, providing a new perspective on non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak symmetry breaking states in stochastic dephasing stabilizer circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering mixed state quantum orders is an on-going issue. Recently, it has been recognized that there are (at least) two kinds of symmetries in the mixed state; strong and weak symmetries. Under symmetry-respective decoherence, spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) can occur. This work provides a scheme to describe SSSB and other decoherence phenomena in the mixed state by employing the stabilizer formalism and the efficient numerical algorithm of Clifford circuits. We present two systematic numerical studies. In a two-dimensional (2D) circuit with a stochastic Ising type decoherence, an SSSB phase transition is clearly observed and its criticality is elucidated by the numerical methods. In particular, we calculate R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations and estimate critical exponents of the SSSB transition. For the second system, we introduce an idea of subsystem SSSB. As an example, we study a system with symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) order provided by both one-form and zero-form symmetries, and observe how the system evolves under decoherence. After displaying numerical results, we show that viewpoint of percolation is quite useful to understand the SSSB transition, which is applicable for a wide range of decohered states. Finally, we comment on SSSB of one-form-symmetry exemplifying toric code.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating Quantum Cloud Environments with Qonductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe Qonductor, a cloud orchestrator for hybrid quantum-classical applications that run on heterogeneous hybrid resources. Qonductor exposes the $Qonductor~API$, a high-level and hardware-agnostic API for customizable hybrid application development and execution, that abstracts away the complexity of hybrid resource management. To guide hybrid resource management, the $resource~estimator$ accurately estimates execution fidelity and runtime to generate and offer resource plans. The $hybrid~scheduler$ leverages the resource plans to automate job scheduling on hybrid resources and balance the tradeoff between users' objectives of high fidelity and low runtimes and the cloud operator's objective of resource efficiency.
  We implement an open-source prototype of Qonductor by building on top of Kubernetes and evaluate it using more than 7000 real quantum runs on the IBM quantum cloud to simulate real cloud workloads. Qonductor achieves up to 54\% lower job completion times (JCTs) while sacrificing 6\% fidelity, balances the load across QPU which increases quantum resource utilization by up to 66\%, and scales with increasing system sizes and loads.</description>

      <title>Mostly Harmless Methods for QSP-Processing with Laurent Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and its extensions are increasingly popular frameworks for developing quantum algorithms. Yet QSP implementations still struggle to complete a classical pre-processing step ('QSP-processing') that determines the set of $SU(2)$ rotation matrices defining the QSP circuit. We introduce a method of QSP-processing for complex polynomials that identifies a solution without optimization or root-finding and verify the success of our methods with polynomials characterized by floating point precision coefficients. We demonstrate the success of our technique for relevant target polynomials and precision regimes, including the Jacobi-Anger expansion used in QSP Hamiltonian Simulation. For popular choices of sign and inverse function approximations, we characterize regimes where all known QSP-processing methods should be expected to struggle without arbitrary precision arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Universal Quench Dynamics of an Open Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking the quantum Kitaev chain as an example, we have studied the universal dynamical behaviors resulting from quantum criticality under the condition of environmental temperature quench. Our findings reveal that when the quantum parameter is at its critical value, both the excess excitation density at the end of linear quench and the subsequent free relaxation behavior exhibit universal scaling behaviors. The scaling laws observed upon quenching to the zero-temperature quantum critical point and non-zero temperature points exhibit distinct scaling exponents, which are all intimately related to the dynamical critical exponents of the quantum phase transition. Additionally, for the case of linear quench to finite temperatures, we have also discovered an intrinsic universal dynamical behavior that is independent of quantum criticality. Our research offers profound insights into the relationship between quantum criticality and nonequilibrium dynamics from two perspectives: Kibble-Zurek-like scaling behavior and free relaxation dynamics. Notably, the Kibble-Zurek-like scaling behavior in this context differs from the standard Kibble-Zurek mechanism. These two aspects jointly open up a new avenue for us to understand quantum criticality through real-time dynamical behavior, even at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Optimal Layout-Aware CNOT Circuit Synthesis with Qubit Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CNOT optimization plays a significant role in noise reduction for Quantum Circuits. Several heuristic and exact approaches exist for CNOT optimization. In this paper, we investigate more complicated variations of optimal synthesis by allowing qubit permutations and handling layout restrictions. We encode such problems into Planning, SAT, and QBF. We provide optimization for both CNOT gate count and circuit depth. For experimental evaluation, we consider standard T-gate optimized benchmarks and optimize CNOT sub-circuits. We show that allowing qubit permutations can further reduce up to 56% in CNOT count and 46% in circuit depth. In the case of optimally mapped circuits under layout restrictions, we observe a reduction up to 17% CNOT count and 19% CNOT depth.</description>

      <title>Ultrabright-entanglement-based quantum key distribution over a 404-km-long optical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entangled photons are crucial resources for quantum communications and networking. Here, we present an ultra-bright polarization-entangled photon source based on a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide designed for practical quantum communication networks. Using a 780 nm pump laser, the source achieves a pair generation rate of 2.4 $\times 10^{10}$ pairs/s/mW. This work has achieved a directly measured power of 17.9 nW in entangled photon generation with a 3.2 mW pump power. Based on this, we demonstrate the practicality of the source by conducting quantum key distribution experiments over long-distance fiber links, achieving the applicable secure key rates of up to 440.80 bits/s over 200 km with 62 dB loss and reaching a maximum secure key generation distance of 404 km. These results demonstrate the potential of wavelength-multiplexed polarization-entangled photon sources for high-speed, long-distance quantum communication, positioning them as key components for future large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Towards Less Greedy Quantum Coalition Structure Generation in Induced Subgraph Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to 100% renewable energy requires new techniques for managing energy networks, such as dividing them into sensible subsets of prosumers called micro-grids. Doing so in an optimal manner is a difficult optimization problem, as it can be abstracted to the Coalition Structure Generation problem in Induced Subgraph Games, a NP-complete problem which requires dividing an undirected, complete, weighted graph into subgraphs in a way that maximizes the sum of their internal weights. Recently, Venkatesh et al. (arXiv:2212.11372) published a Quantum Annealing (QA)-based iterative algorithm called GCS-Q, which they claim to be the best currently existing solver for the problem in terms of runtime complexity. As this algorithm makes the application of QA to the problem seem promising, but is a greedy one, this work proposes several less greedy QA-based approaches and investigates whether any of them can outperform GCS-Q in terms of solution quality. While we find that this is not the case yet on D-Wave hardware, most of them do when using the classical QBSolv software as a solver. Especially an algorithm we call 4-split iterative R-QUBO shows potential here, finding all optima in our dataset while scaling favorably with the problem size in terms of runtime. Thus, it appears to be interesting for future research on quantum approaches to the problem, assuming QA hardware will become more noise-resilient over time.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of Ancillary System for Quantum Noise Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to mitigate the decoherence effects on a target system S by coupling it to an ancillary system A with tunable parameters. By suitably engineering the S-A interaction Hamiltonian, a dark factorized compound state is found that achieves effective noise cancellation and significantly preserves quantum coherence in the target system S. We illustrate our methodology for a system $S$ consisting of two-mode Bosons trapped in a double-well potential and affected by decoherence through a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation. By a suitable coupling of the system $S$ with an ancillary two-mode system of the same kind of S via a density-density interaction, we enhance the resilience of the system NOON state, a quantum-mechanical many-body entangled state crucial for quantum computing. We further explore potential experimental implementations of the proposed noise cancellation technique, focusing on configurations involving dipole-dipole interactions in optical lattices. Finally, we propose a numerical optimization protocol that learns the system A and its interaction with S to maximize the survival probability of specific quantum states which can be potentially used in more generic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dark spin-cats as biased qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a biased atomic qubit, universally implementable across all atomic platforms, encoded as a `spin-cat' within ground state Zeeman levels. The key characteristic of our configuration is the coupling of the ground state spin manifold of size $F_g \gg 1$ to an excited Zeeman spin manifold of size $F_e = F_g - 1$ using light. This coupling results in eigenstates of the driven atom that include exactly two dark states in the ground state manifold, which are decoupled from light and immune to spontaneous emission from the excited states. These dark states constitute the `spin-cat', leading to the designation `dark spin-cat'. We demonstrate that under strong Rabi drive and for large $F_g$, the `dark spin-cat' is autonomously stabilized against common noise sources and encodes a qubit with significantly biased noise. Specifically, the bit-flip error rate decreases exponentially with $F_g$ relative to the dephasing rate. We provide an analysis of dark spin-cats, their robustness to noise, and discuss bias-preserving single qubit and entangling gates, exemplified on a Rydberg tweezer platform.</description>

      <title>Optimization of conveyance of quantum particles by moving potential-well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical control of the position of a particle by using a trapping potential-well is an important problem for the manipulation of a quantum particle. We study the probability of successful conveyance of a particle trapping in a potential-well, i.e., survival probability in the process carrying of the particle for a given length within a given fixed time. For the actual motion of conveyance, we need to accelerate the particle to move and then decelerate it to stop at the destination. First, the relaxation of the survival probability in a constant acceleration rate is studied in detail by direct numerical calculation, the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method, and a method of the resonance states. The survival probability was found to show an exponential decay in a long time, which is analyzed from a viewpoint of eigenvalue problem. An important source of drop-off comes from a non-analytic change of velocity at the starting point. When the rested particle begins to move, the ground state of the rest frame is redistributed to eigenstates of the moving frame, and then, each eigenstate of the moving frame evolves in time. The dephasing of wavefunctions of the distributed populations reduces the probability of successful conveyance. In general, a smooth start gives a small initial disturbance but requires a large acceleration during the process to reach the destination in the fixed time which causes a larger drop-off in the process. Considering these conflicting facts, we study the survival probability in concrete conveyance schemes. We observe the time evolution of the trapped probability and the population distribution during the conveyance process. In cases that the potential-well has several bound states, we propose a method to select the particle trapped at the ground state by making use of the difference of survival probabilities of bound states.</description>

      <title>Role of Error Syndromes in Teleportation Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation enables quantum information transmission, but requires distribution of entangled resource states. Unfortunately, decoherence, caused by environmental interference during quantum state storage, can degrade quantum states, leading to entanglement loss in the resource state and reduction of the fidelity of the teleported information. In this work, we investigate the use of error correction and error syndrome information in scheduling teleportation at a quantum network node in the presence of multiple teleportation requests and a finite rate of remote entanglement distribution. Specifically, we focus on the scenario where stored qubits undergo decoherence over time due to imperfect memories. To protect the qubits from the resulting errors, we employ quantum encodings, and the stored qubits undergo repeated error correction, generating error syndromes in each round. These error syndromes can provide additional benefits, as they can be used to calculate qubit-specific error likelihoods, which can then be utilized to make better scheduling decisions. By integrating error correction techniques into the scheduling process, our goal is to minimize errors and decoherence effects, thereby enhancing the fidelity and efficiency of teleportation in a quantum network setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning: Performance and Security Implications in Real-World Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has garnered significant attention in recent years from both academia and industry due to its potential to achieve a "quantum advantage" over classical computers. The advent of quantum computing introduces new challenges for security and privacy. This poster explores the performance and security implications of quantum computing through a case study of machine learning in a real-world application. We compare the performance of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to their classical counterparts using the Alzheimer's disease dataset. Our results indicate that QML algorithms show promising potential while they still have not surpassed classical algorithms in terms of learning capability and convergence difficulty, and running quantum algorithms through simulations on classical computers requires significantly large memory space and CPU time. Our study also indicates that QMLs have inherited vulnerabilities from classical machine learning algorithms while also introduce new attack vectors.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Vault Scheme for Digital Currency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digital currency is money in a digital form. In this model, maintaining integrity of the supply is a core concern, therefore protections against double-spending are often at the heart of a secure digital money scheme. Quantum money exploits the quantum mechanical principle of no-cloning to enable a currency that is immune to double spending. One of the challenges of the scheme is that users require technology that is currently out of reach. Here, we propose a model for quantum currency, which alleviates the need for quantum wallets by delegating quantum storage and processing to an intermediary that we call a "quantum vault". We develop the basic building blocks of this quantum-enabled digital currency and discuss its benefits and challenges.</description>

      <title>Randomness versus Nonlocality in Multi-input and Multi-output Quantum Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent randomness certification based on Bell nonlocality does not require any assumptions about the devices and therefore provides adequate security. Great effort has been made to demonstrate that nonlocality is necessary for generating quantum randomness, but the minimal resource required for random number generation has not been clarified. Here we first prove and experimentally demonstrate that violating any two-input Bell inequality is both necessary and sufficient for certifying randomness, however, for the multi-input cases, this sufficiency ceases to apply, leading to certain states exhibiting Bell nonlocality without the capability to certify randomness. We examine two typical classes of Bell inequalities with multi-input and multi-output, the facet inequalities and Salavrakos-Augusiak-Tura-Wittek-Ac\'in-Pironio Bell inequalities, in the high-dimensional photonic system, and observe the violation of the latter one can always certify randomness which is not true for the former. The private randomness with a generation rate of 1.867\pm0.018 bits per photon pair is obtained in the scenario of Salavrakos-Augusiak-Tura-Wittek-Ac\'in-Pironio Bell inequalities with 3-input and 4-output. Our work unravels the internal connection between randomness and nonlocality, and effectively enhances the performance of tasks such as device-independent random number generation.</description>

      <title>A physical proof of the topological entanglement entropy inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) of a two-dimensional gapped ground state obeys the universal inequality $\gamma \geq \log \mathcal{D}$, where $\gamma$ is the TEE and $\mathcal{D}$ is the total quantum dimension of all anyon excitations, $\mathcal{D} = \sqrt{\sum_a d_a^2}$. Here we present an alternative, more direct proof of this inequality. Our proof uses only the strong subadditivity property of the von Neumann entropy together with a few physical assumptions about the ground state density operator. Our derivation naturally generalizes to a variety of systems, including spatially inhomogeneous systems with defects and boundaries, higher dimensional systems, and mixed states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a framework for a mechanism steering state vector collapse through time evolution as described by the Schr\"odinger's equation. Under the premise of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics, a main outcome is that collapse has to occur when the Hamiltonian completes a closed loop in the parameter space encoding the interaction with the meter. For two-level systems, we put forward the phenomenon of chiral state conversion as a mechanism effectively eliminating superpositions. Our results open a way to simulate quantum measurements in classical systems that up to now were restricted to the Schr\"odinger part of the quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is often constrained by the limitations in probing relevant observables, especially in continuous systems. A prominent example is two parallel 1D Bose gases, which simulate 1D quantum field theories through the phase difference probed by interference. Here we introduce a method to extract the total phase of the combined system based on a general principle of reconstructing phase gradient from density dynamics using continuity equation. This approach reveals the previously hidden sector of the sum mode of the two 1D Bose gases. We validate our technique numerically and demonstrate its effectiveness by analysing data from selected experiments, showcasing how our method expands the scope and capabilities of cold-atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incompressible insulating phases of electronic systems at partial filling of a lattice are often associated with charge ordering that breaks lattice symmetry. The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective integer filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which we dub "Quantum Charge Liquids" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that preserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either have gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order or have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on gapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological order. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is consistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational fillings $\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state degeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that of the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical systems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of these phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Easy-plane quantum magnets are strikingly similar to superconductors, allowing for spin supercurrent and an effective superconducting phase stemming from their $U(1)$ rotation symmetry around the $z$-axis. We uncover a generalized fractional Josephson effect with a periodicity that increases linearly with system size in one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ chains at selected anisotropies and phase-fixing boundary fields. The effect combines arbitrary integer periodicities in a single system, exceeding the $4\pi $ and $8\pi $ periodicity of superconducting Josephson effects of Majorana zero modes and other exotic quasiparticles. We reveal a universal energy-phase relation and connect the effect to the recently discovered phantom helices.</description>

      <title>Shift photocurrent vortices from topological polarization textures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the recent interest in van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics, topologically nontrivial polar structures have been predicted to form in twisted bilayers. Due to the unconventional nature of vdW ferroelectricity, these topological polar structures have proven difficult to observe experimentally. Here we propose that these textures may be probed optically by showing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear optical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian Berry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding and first-principles calculations. For the case of moir\'e materials without centrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift photoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of frequencies where transitions occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift photocurrents are anti-parallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field. Our findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and nonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after strategy for the experimental detection of topological polarization structures.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Interactions of the Cosmic Neutrino Background, Axions, Dark Matter, and Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we do three things. First, we outline the conditions under which the interaction rate of inelastic processes that change the internal state of a system of $N$ targets scales as $N^2$. This is an effect distinct from coherent elastic scattering, but with the same scaling. Second, we compute example rates for such processes for various weakly interacting particles. Finally, we point to potential quantum observables for these processes that go beyond traditional energy exchange.
  Maximal coherence in inelastic processes is achieved when the targets are placed in an equal superposition of the ground and excited states. These coherent inelastic processes are analogous to Dicke superradiance, and we thus refer to them as superradiant interactions.
  We compute the superradiant interaction rates for the C$\nu$B, dark matter scattering and absorption, and late-universe particles, such as reactor neutrinos, when the two-level system is realized by nuclear or electron spins in a magnetic field. The rates we find can be quite sizable on macroscopic yet small targets. For example, the C$\nu$B interacts with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\text{Hz})$ when scattering off a 10~cm liquid or solid-state density spin-polarized sphere. For QCD axion dark matter, similar rates can be achieved with much smaller samples, $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{15})\left(\frac{m}{2\times 10^{-8}~\text{eV}}\right)^{-1/2}$, where $m$ is the axion mass.
  Using the Lindblad formalism for open quantum systems, we show that these superradiant interactions can manifest as a source of noise on the system. This points to new observables, sensitive to the sum of the excitation and de-excitation rates, and can be viewed as introducing diffusion and decoherence to the system. The effects presented in this paper may point to a new class of ultra-low threshold detectors.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order Correlators and Chaos in Quantum Billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine three billiard systems -- the cardioid, diamond (Superman), and Sinai billiards -- all of which are known to be classically chaotic. We compute their classical Lyapunov exponents, and using out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in the semi-classical regime, we also derive their quantum Lyapunov exponents. We observe that the classical and quantum Lyapunov exponents are in agreement, strengthening the role of OTOCs as a diagnostic for quantum chaos in billiard systems. At very low temperatures, the OTOC of the Sinai billiard shows sharp growth, a phenomenon absent in the other two billiards. We identify the source of this anomalous behaviour in the geometry of the ground state wave function of the Sinai billiard, which is more sensitive to the curvature of the billiard compared to the other billiards. We also remark on the late-time behaviour of the OTOCs and how the scrambling/Ehrenfest time is related to the temperature of quantum billiards.</description>

      <title>Schwinger pair production in counterpropagating laser pulses: Identifying volume factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonperturbative process of vacuum pair production in a combination of two counterpropagating linearly polarized laser pulses of a finite spatial extent. By means of the locally-constant field approximation (LCFA), we calculate the total particle yield for the corresponding four-dimensional setup and compare it with the estimates obtained for simplified low-dimensional scenarios. Within the domain where the LCFA is well justified, we examine a combination of two plane-wave pulses, a standing electromagnetic wave, and a spatially uniform oscillating field and demonstrate that at each of these three levels of approximation, one can accurately predict the actual particle number by multiplying the results by properly chosen volume factors depending on the field parameters. We present closed-form expressions for these factors providing universal prescriptions for evaluating the particle yield. Our final formula connecting the spatially uniform setup with the four-dimensional scenario has a relative uncertainty of the level of $5\%$. The explicit correspondences deduced in this study not only prove the relevance of the approximate predictions, but also allow one to quickly estimate the number of pairs for various realistic scenarios without performing complicated numerical calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</description>

Abstract: Polarimetric imaging, a technique that captures the invisible polarization-related properties of given materials, has broad applications from fundamental physics to advanced fields such as target recognition, stress detection, biomedical diagnosis and remote sensing. The introduction of quantum sources into classical imaging systems has demonstrated distinct advantages, yet few studies have explored their combination with polarimetric imaging. In this study, we present a quantum polarimetric imaging system that integrates polarization-entangled photon pairs into a polarizer-sample-compensator-analyzer (PSRA)-type polarimeter. Our system visualizes the birefringence properties of a periodical-distributed anisotropic material under decreasing illumination levels and diverse disturbing light sources. Compared to the classical system, the quantum approach reveals the superior sensitivity and robustness in low-light conditions, particularly useful in biomedical studies where the low illumination and non-destructive detection are urgently needed. The study also highlights the nonlocality of entangled photons in birefringence measurement, indicating the potential of quantum polarimetric system in the remote sensing domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry imposes constraints on open quantum systems, affecting the dissipative properties in nonequilibrium processes. Superradiance is a typical example in which the decay rate of the system is enhanced via a collective system-bath coupling that respects permutation symmetry. Such model has also been applied to heat engines. However, a generic framework that addresses the impact of symmetry in finite-time thermodynamics is not well established. Here, we show a symmetry-based framework that describes the fundamental limit of collective enhancement in finite-time thermodynamics. Specifically, we derive a general upper bound on the average jump rate, which quantifies the fundamental speed set by thermodynamic speed limits and trade-off relations. We identify the symmetry condition which achieves the obtained bound, and explicitly construct an open quantum system model that goes beyond the enhancement realized by the conventional superradiance model.</description>

Abstract: We present an X-ray based stimulated Raman approach to control the preparation of optically dark electronic states in generic molecular systems. Leveraging on the unique properties of core-level excited states, we demonstrate that optically forbidden transitions between singlet states, or between singlet and triplet states are made accessible. Two molecular systems are studied as a test-bed of the proposed approach, and its experimental feasibility is eventually discussed.</description>

      <title>Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating the fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In this study, we introduce the concept of {\it separated states}, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states. This concept generalizes many critical states involved in relevant thermodynamic operations. We uncover a three-way trade-off relation between {\it time}, {\it cost}, and {\it error} for a general class of thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\tau{\cal C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge 1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a similar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a pure state with a given error. The generalization to general quantum dynamics involving a system coupled to a finite bath implies that heat dissipation becomes infinite as the quantum system is exactly cooled down to the ground state or perfectly reset to a pure state, thereby resolving an open question regarding the thermodynamic cost of information erasure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Krylov subspace methods, being one category of the most important classical numerical methods for linear algebra problems, can be much more powerful when generalised to quantum computing. However, quantum Krylov subspace algorithms are prone to errors due to inevitable statistical fluctuations in quantum measurements. To address this problem, we develop a general theoretical framework to analyse the statistical error and measurement cost. Based on the framework, we propose a quantum algorithm to construct the Hamiltonian-power Krylov subspace that can minimise the measurement cost. In our algorithm, the product of power and Gaussian functions of the Hamiltonian is expressed as an integral of the real-time evolution, such that it can be evaluated on a quantum computer. We compare our algorithm with other established quantum Krylov subspace algorithms in solving two prominent examples. To achieve an error comparable to that of the classical Lanczos algorithm at the same subspace dimension, our algorithm typically requires orders of magnitude fewer measurements than others. Such an improvement can be attributed to the reduced cost of composing projectors onto the ground state. These results show that our algorithm is exceptionally robust to statistical fluctuations and promising for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two novel measurement-based, quantum clustering algorithms are proposed based on quantum parallelism and entanglement. The first algorithm follows a divisive approach. The second algorithm is based on unsharp measurements, where we construct an effect operator with a Gaussian probability distribution to cluster similar data points. A major advantage of both algorithms is that they are simplistic in nature, easy to implement, and well suited for noisy intermediate scale quantum computers. We have successfully applied the first algorithm on a concentric circle data set, where the classical clustering approach fails, as well as on the Churrtiz data set of $130$ cities, where we show that the algorithm succeeds with very low quantum resources. We applied the second algorithm on the labeled Wisconsin breast cancer dataset, and found that it is able to classify the dataset with high accuracy using only $O(log(D))$ qubits and polynomial measurements, where $D$ is the maximal distance within any two points in the dataset. We also show that this algorithm works better with an assumed measurement error in the quantum system, making it extremely well-suited for NISQ devices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum adiabaticity is characterized by the evolution of a quantum system that remains close to an instantaneous eigenstate of a time-varying Hamiltonian, precluding transitions between eigenstates. Employing Floquet formalism, we rigorously establish two sufficient conditions that ensure quantum adiabaticity in periodically driven systems, applicable for time evolution of arbitrary length. Distinct from traditional conditions, the Floquet-based conditions are tight for certain specific parameter regimes, dispense with supplementary constraints, and suggest the possibility of adiabaticity at high frequencies. We provide three illustrative examples that compare and contrast the Floquet conditions with traditional ones.</description>

Abstract: Here we introduce the concept of classical input - quantum output (C-Q) non-signalling boxes, a generalisation of the classical input - classical output (C-C) non-signalling boxes. We argue that studying such objects leads to a better understanding of the relation between quantum nonlocality and non-locality beyond quantum mechanics. The main issue discussed in the paper is whether there exist 'genuine' C-Q boxes or all C-Q boxes can be built from objects already known, namely C-C boxes acting on pre-shared entangled quantum particles. We show that large classes of C-Q boxes are non-genuine. In particular, we show that all bi-partite C-Q boxes with outputs that are pure states are non-genuine. We also present various strategies for addressing the general problem, i.e. for multi-partite C-Q boxes which output mixed states, whose answer is still open. Finally, we show that even some very simple non-genuine C-Q boxes require large amounts of C-C nonlocal correlations in order to simulate them.</description>

      <title>Scalable Determination of Multipartite Entanglement in Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17771v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks comprised of entangled end nodes serve stronger than the classical correlation for unparalleled quantum internet applications. However, practical quantum networking is affected by noise, which at its worst, causes end nodes to be described by pre-existing classical data. In such untrusted networks, determining quantum network fidelity and genuine multi-node entanglement becomes crucial. Here, we show that determining quantum network fidelity and genuine $N$-node entanglement in an untrusted star network requires only $N+1$ measurement settings. This method establishes a semi-trusted framework, allowing some nodes to relax their assumptions. Our network determination method is enabled by detecting genuine $N$-node Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steerability. Experimentally, using spontaneous parametric down-conversion entanglement sources, we demonstrate the determinations of genuine 3-photon and 4-photon quantum networks and the false positives of the widely used entanglement witness, the fidelity criterion of $1/2$. Our results provide a scalable method for the determination of multipartite entanglement in realistic quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: With the control of ever more complex quantum systems becoming a reality, new scenarios are emerging where generalizations of the most foundational aspects of statistical quantum mechanics are imperative. In such experimental scenarios the often natural correspondence between the particles that compose the system and the relevant degrees-of-freedom might not be observed. In the present work we employ quantum channels to define generalized subsystems, which should capture the pertinent degrees-of-freedom, and obtain their associated canonical state. Moreover, we show that generalized subsystems also display the phenomena of canonical typicality, i.e., the generalized subsystem description generated from almost any microscopic pure state of the whole system will behave similarly as the corresponding canonical state. In particular we demonstrate that the property regulating the emergence of the canonical typicality behavior is the entropy of the channel used to define the generalized subsystem.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement-assisted classical communication (EACC) aims to enhance communication systems using entanglement as an additional resource. However, there is a scarcity of explicit protocols designed for finite transmission scenarios, which presents a challenge for real-world implementation. In response we introduce a new EACC scheme capable of correcting a fixed number of erasures/errors. It can be adjusted to the available amount of entanglement and sends classical information over a quantum channel. We establish a general framework to accomplish such a task by reducing it to a classical problem. Comparing with specific bounds we identify optimal parameter ranges. The scheme requires only the implementation of super-dense coding which has been demonstrated successfully in experiments. Furthermore, our results shows that an adaptable entanglement use confers a communication advantage. Overall, our work sheds light on how entanglement can elevate various finite-length communication protocols, opening new avenues for exploration in the field.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) in the current NISQ era is still limited in size and precision. Hybrid applications mitigating those shortcomings are prevalent to gain early insight and advantages. Hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) comprises both the application of QC to improve machine learning (ML) and ML to improve QC architectures. This work considers the latter, leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to improve quantum circuit design (QCD), which we formalize by a set of generic objectives. Furthermore, we propose qcd-gym, a concrete framework formalized as a Markov decision process, to enable learning policies capable of controlling a universal set of continuously parameterized quantum gates. Finally, we provide benchmark comparisons to assess the shortcomings and strengths of current state-of-the-art RL algorithms.</description>

Abstract: This work provides a nonasymptotic error analysis of quantum Krylov algorithms based on real-time evolutions, subject to generic errors in the outputs of the quantum circuits. We prove upper and lower bounds on the resulting ground state energy estimates, and the error in the upper bound is linear in the input error rates. This resolves a misalignment between known numerics, which exhibit approximately linear error scaling, and prior theoretical analysis, which only provably obtained square-root scaling. Our main technique is to express generic errors in terms of an effective target Hamiltonian studied in an effective Krylov space. These results provide a theoretical framework for understanding the main features of quantum Krylov errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of non-interacting bosons in the presence of repeated projective measurements is studied. Following the established approach, this monitored evolution is characterized by the first detected return and the first detected transition probabilities. We show that these quantities are directly related to the entanglement entropy and to the entanglement spectrum of a bipartite system. Calculations with specific values for the number of bosons, the number of measurements and the time step between measurements reveal a sensitive and often strongly fluctuating entanglement entropy. In particular, we demonstrate that in the vicinity of special values for the time steps the evolution of the entanglement entropy is either stationary or performs dynamical switching between two or more stationary values. In the entanglement spectrum, on the other hand, this complex behavior can be associated with level crossings, indicating that the dominant quantum states and their entanglement respond strongly to a change of the system parameters. We discuss briefly the role of time averaging to remove the fluctuations of the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>A scalable 2-local architecture for quantum annealing of Ising models with arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving dense connectivities is a challenge for most quantum computing platforms today, and a particularly crucial one for the case of quantum annealing applications. In this context, we present a scalable architecture for quantum annealers described by a hardware graph of degree $d=3$ and containing exclusively 2-local interactions to realize Ising models of arbitrary dimension. By describing the problem graph in terms of triangles, we derive this resource-efficient configuration based on logical chains of qubits. We also devise strategies to address the challenges of scaling this architecture, identifying driver Hamiltonians more suited to the symmetries of the logical solution space. We thus show a promising new route to scale up devices dedicated to classical optimization tasks within the quantum annealing paradigm.</description>

      <title>An Indeterminacy-based Ontology for Quantum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present and defend a new ontology for quantum theories (or ``interpretations'' of quantum theory) called Generative Quantum Theory (GQT). GQT postulates different sets of features, and the combination of these different features can help generate different quantum theories. Furthermore, this ontology makes quantum indeterminacy and determinacy play an important explanatory role in accounting for when quantum systems whose values of their properties are indeterminate become determinate. The process via which determinate values arise varies between the different quantum theories. Moreover, quantum states represent quantum properties and structures that give rise to determinacy, and each quantum theory specifies a structure with certain features. I will focus on the following quantum theories: GRW, the Many-Worlds Interpretation, single-world relationalist theories such as Relational Quantum Mechanics, Bohmian Mechanics, hybrid classical-quantum theories, and Environmental Determinacy-based (EnD) Quantum Theory. I will argue that GQT should be taken seriously because it provides a series of important benefits that current widely discussed ontologies lack, namely, wave function realism and primitive ontology, without some of their costs. For instance, it helps generate quantum theories that are compatible with relativistic causality, such as EnD Quantum Theory. Also, GQT has the benefit of providing new ways to compare and evaluate quantum theories, which may lead to philosophical and scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Implementing a synthetic magnetic vector potential in a 2D superconducting qubit array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00873v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a compelling platform for analog quantum simulation due to the precision control, fast operation, and site-resolved readout inherent to the hardware. Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here, we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys requisite properties of electromagnetism: a spatially-varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally-varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect--the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field--exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for the Preparation and Detection of Long-Lived Singlet States in NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing efficient and robust quantum control strategies is vital for developing quantum technologies. One recent strategy is the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) sequence that alternatively propagates under two noncommuting Hamiltonians, whose control parameters can be optimized to generate a gate or prepare a state. Here, we describe the design of the QAOA sequence and their variants to prepare long-lived singlet states (LLS) from the thermal state in NMR. With extraordinarily long lifetimes exceeding the spin-lattice relaxation time constant $T_1$, LLS have been of great interest for various applications, from spectroscopy to medical imaging. Accordingly, designing sequences for efficiently preparing LLS in a general spin system is crucial. Using numerical analysis, we study the efficiency and robustness of the QAOA sequences over a wide range of errors in the control parameters. Using a two-qubit NMR register, we conduct an experimental study to benchmark QAOA sequences against other prominent methods of LLS preparation and observe the significantly superior performance of the QAOA sequences.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum error correcting codes from conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy subspace of a conformal field theory (CFT) can serve as a quantum error correcting code, with important consequences in holography and quantum gravity. We consider generic 1+1D CFT codes under extensive local dephasing channels and analyze their error correctability in the thermodynamic limit. We show that (i) there is a finite decoding threshold if and only if the minimal nonzero scaling dimension in the fusion algebra generated by the jump operator of the channel is larger than $1/2$ and (ii) the number of protected logical qubits $k \geq \Omega( \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. As an application, we show that the one-dimensional quantum critical Ising model has a finite threshold for certain types of dephasing noise. Our general results also imply that a CFT code with continuous symmetry saturates a bound on the recovery fidelity for covariant codes.</description>

      <title>Does the full configuration interaction method based on quantum phase estimation with Trotter decomposition satisfy the size consistency condition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations of atoms and molecules are considered to be a promising application for quantum computers. Two key algorithms, the quantum phase estimation (QPE) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), have been extensively studied. The condition that the energy of a dimer consisting of two monomers separated by a large distance should be equal to twice the energy of a monomer, known as size consistency, is essential in quantum chemical calculations. Recently, we reported that the size consistency condition can be violated by Trotterization in the unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz in VQE when employing molecular orbitals delocalized to the dimer (K. Sugisaki {\it et al.}, {\it J. Comput. Chem.}, published online; \href{https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.27438}{DOI:10.1002/jcc.27438}). It is well known that the full configuration interaction (full-CI) energy is invariant to arbitrary rotations of molecular orbitals, and therefore the QPE-based full-CI should theoretically satisfy the size consistency. However, Trotterization of the time evolution operator can break the size consistency conditions. In this work, we investigated whether the size consistency can be maintained with Trotterization of the time evolution operator in QPE-based full-CI calculations. Our numerical simulations revealed that size consistency in QPE-based full-CI is not automatically violated by using molecular orbitals delocalized to the dimer, but employing an appropriate Trotter decomposition condition is crucial to maintain size consistency. We also report on the acceleration of QPE simulations through the sequential addition of ancillary qubits.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Structure in Quantum Relative Entropy Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum relative entropy programs are convex optimization problems which minimize a linear functional over an affine section of the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy function. Recently, the self-concordance of a natural barrier function was proved for this set. This has opened up the opportunity to use interior-point methods for nonsymmetric cone programs to solve these optimization problems. In this paper, we show how common structures arising from applications in quantum information theory can be exploited to improve the efficiency of solving quantum relative entropy programs using interior-point methods. First, we show that the natural barrier function for the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy composed with positive linear operators is optimally self-concordant, even when these linear operators map to singular matrices. Compared to modelling problems using the full quantum relative entropy cone, this allows us to remove redundant log determinant expressions from the barrier function and reduce the overall barrier parameter. Second, we show how certain slices of the quantum relative entropy cone exhibit useful properties which should be exploited whenever possible to perform certain key steps of interior-point methods more efficiently. We demonstrate how these methods can be applied to applications in quantum information theory, including quantifying quantum key rates, quantum rate-distortion functions, quantum channel capacities, and the ground state energy of Hamiltonians. Our numerical results show that these techniques improve computation times by up to several orders of magnitude, and allow previously intractable problems to be solved.</description>

      <title>Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase diagram with the MBDL and delocalization states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase diagram. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL regime, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Adiabatic Learning for Quantum-Classical Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-classical hybrid dynamics is crucial for accurately simulating complex systems where both quantum and classical behaviors need to be considered. However, coupling between classical and quantum degrees of freedom and the exponential growth of the Hilbert space present significant challenges. Current machine learning approaches for predicting such dynamics, while promising, remain unknown in their error bounds, sample complexity, and generalizability. In this work, we establish a generic theoretical framework for analyzing quantum-classical adiabatic dynamics with learning algorithms. Based on quantum information theory, we develop a provably efficient adiabatic learning (PEAL) algorithm with logarithmic system size sampling complexity and favorable time scaling properties. We benchmark PEAL on the Holstein model, and demonstrate its accuracy in predicting single-path dynamics and ensemble dynamics observables as well as transfer learning over a family of Hamiltonians. Our framework and algorithm open up new avenues for reliable and efficient learning of quantum-classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Petz map recovery for long-range entangled quantum many-body states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a tripartite quantum state on $A,B,C$ and the erasure channel on $C$, the rotated Petz map is a recovery channel that acts on $B$ to recover the erased quantum information. The infidelity of the best recovery is upper-bounded by the conditional mutual information (CMI). In this work, we study the infidelity of the rotated Petz map on several physically-relevant long-range entangled quantum states. Specifically, we study three classes of quantum phases: (i) steady states of measurement-induced phase transitions, (ii) critical ground state under local measurements, and (iii) chiral states under local measurements. We find that the average Petz map infidelity sharply distinguishes the three classes: (i) and (ii) are distinguished by the scaling of the infidelity with CMI and (iii) is characterized by an asymmetry of the infidelity with the rotation parameter. We also study Petz map recovery for topological order and find an operational interpretation of the topological entanglement entropy. Our result indicates that the Petz map fidelity is a useful diagnostic of quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.06040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of chemistry, where nuclear motion has traditionally been a focal point, we now explore the ultra-rapid electronic motion spanning attoseconds to femtoseconds, demonstrating that it is equally integral and relevant to the discipline. The advent of ultrashort attosecond pulse technology has revolutionized our ability to directly observe electronic rearrangements in atoms and molecules, offering a time-resolved insight into these swift processes. Prominent examples include Auger-Meitner decay and Interparticle Coulombic Decay (ICD). However, the real challenge lies in interpreting these observations, where theoretical models are indispensable.
  Building upon the analytical framework introduced in Phys. Rev. A 101, 043414 (2020), which analyzed the spectra of electrons emitted during electronic decay processes from a purely electronic perspective, our paper represents a significant advancement. We extend this theoretical base to include nuclear dynamics, utilizing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to deepen our understanding of the intricate interaction between electronic and nuclear motion in these processes.
  We illustrate the impact of incorporating nuclear degrees of freedom in several theoretical cases characterized by different numbers of vibrational bound states in both the electronic resonance and the electronic final state. This approach not only clarifies complex spectral features and unusual peak shapes but also demonstrates a method for extracting the energy differences between multiple vibrational resonance states through their distinctive interference patterns.</description>

Abstract: Due to presence of magnetic field gradient needed for coherent spin control, dephasing of single-electron spin qubits in silicon quantum dots is often dominated by $1/f$ charge noise. We investigate theoretically fluctuations of ground state energy of an electron in gated quantum dot in realistic Si/SiGe structure. We assume that the charge noise is caused by motion of charges trapped at the semiconductor-oxide interface. We consider a realistic range of trapped charge densities, $\rho \! \sim \! 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical lenghtscales of isotropically distributed displacements of these charges, $\delta r \! \leq \! 1$ nm, and identify pairs $(\rho,\delta r)$ for which the amplitude and shape of the noise spectrum is in good agreement with spectra reconstructed in recent experiments on similar structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well known extension of Einstein General Relativity is the addition of an $R^2$-term, which is free of ghost excitations and in the linearized framework, reduces Einstein General Relativity and an additional higher derivative scalar. According to \cite{Chakraborty:2020ktp}, the above scalar sector can sustain a Time Crystal-like minimum energy state, with non-trivial time dependence. Exploiting previous result that the scalar can sustain modes with periodic time dependence in its lowest energy, we consider this condensate as a source and study the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology in this background. The effect of the $R^2$-term is interpreted as a back reaction. A remarkable consequence of the condensate is that, irrespective of open or close geometry of the Universe, for an appropriate choice of parameter window, the condensate can induce a decelerating phase before the accelerated expansion starts and again, in some cases, it can help to avoid the singularity in the deceleration parameter (that is present in conventional FLRW Cosmology).</description>

Abstract: Capitalizing on recent work, that clarifies the consistent use of bosonization-debosonization methods to study Kondo-type quantum impurity models even in nonequilibrium settings, we revisit the compactification procedure of the two-channel Kondo model (by which it is rewritten more ``compactly'' using the single-channel version of the model and exploiting separation and duality between spin and charge) and uncover some hidden approximations that could limit its range of validity. This complements and extends, for two or any even number of channels, beyond previous work on the Toulouse limit of these models, and reinforces the need for the use of an extended framework in these calculations. We carry out a number of exact comparisons between the different models, and show that keeping track of the, so-called, consistency factors leads to full agreement between the compactified and original versions of the model.</description>

Abstract: Following up on the systematic compactification of the two-channel Kondo model (and its multichannel extensions; see $\href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.03569}{\textsf{companion paper I}}$) and the demonstration of its validity over the past proposal of compactification, we resort to a study of scaling using Anderson's simple poor man's procedure to carry out a comparative study of these two and the original model. By doing so we unveil a universal agreement among the three models in how they flow upon scaling, and suggest the general limits of such a concordance. In this way we further elucidate the conditions under which the standard simplifications implicit in many bosonization-based mappings (particularly of quantum impurity models) can be used reliably, and when the consistent bosonization-debosonization approach is needed.</description>

Abstract: We carry out a field-theoretical renormalization group procedure based on the Callan-Symanzik equation to calculate the detailed flow for the (multi) two-channel Kondo model and its compactified versions. In doing so, we go beyond the universal terms in the beta function we obtained using poor man's scaling (see $\href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.03590}{\textsf{companion paper II}}$) and culminate our analysis of how the compactified versions of the model fare against the original one. Among other results, we explore the large-channel-number limit and extend our considerations to the finite temperature crossover region. Moreover, we gain insights into the contradistinction between the consistent vs. conventional bosonization-debosonization formalisms, thereby advancing our understanding on multiple fronts. In particular, we make use of renormalization-flow arguments to further justify the consistent refermionization of the parallel Kondo interaction we presented earlier (see $\href{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.03569}{\textsf{companion paper I}}$)</description>

      <title>Differences between quantum and classical adiabatic evolution</title>

Abstract: Adiabatic evolution is an emergent design principle for time modulated metamaterials, often inspired by insights from topological quantum computing such as braiding operations. However, the pursuit of classical adiabatic metamaterials is rooted in the assumption that classical and quantum adiabatic evolution are equivalent. We show that this is only true in the limit where the frequencies of all the bands are at infinite distance from $0$; and some instances of quantum adiabatic evolution, such as those containing zero modes, cannot be reproduced in classical systems. This is because mode coupling is fundamentally different in classical mechanics. We derive classical conditions to ensure adiabaticity and demonstrate that only under these conditions - which are different from quantum adiabatic conditions -, the single band Berry phase and Wilczek-Zee matrix for everywhere degenerate bands emerge as meaningful quantities encoding the geometry of classical adiabatic evolution. Finally, for general multiband systems we uncover a correction term in the non-Abelian gauge potential for classical systems.</description>

      <title>Random pure Gaussian states and Hawking radiation</title>

Abstract: A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure and Gaussian with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than $\frac{k_B T_{H}(t)}{\hbar}$ are not populated at time $t$ and drop out of the analysis.Among the other modes we find that correlations and hence entanglement between relatively thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless very unlikely to be entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require any significant quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Many-body phase transitions in a non-Hermitian Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-body phase transitions in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic transversed field Ising model with an imaginary field and show that the system exhibits three phase transitions: one second-order phase transition and two $\mathcal{PT}$ phase transitions. The second-order phase transition occurring in the ground state is investigated via biorthogonal and self-normal entanglement entropy, for which we develop an approach to perform finite-size scaling theory to extract the central charge for small systems. Compared with the second-order phase transition, the first $\mathcal{PT}$ transition is characterized by the appearance of an exceptional point in the full energy spectrum, while the second $\mathcal{PT}$ transition only occurs in specific excited states. Furthermore, we interestingly show that both of exceptional points are second-order in terms of scalings of imaginary parts of the energy. This work provides an exact solution for many-body phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Cellular Automata Generated Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases and Detection Through Multi-Point Strange Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In computer and system sciences, higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) are a type of cellular automata that evolve over multiple time steps and generate complex patterns, which have various applications such as secret sharing schemes, data compression, and image encryption. In this paper, we introduce HOCA to quantum many-body physics and construct a series of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of matter, in which symmetries are supported on a great variety of subsystems embbeded in the SPT bulk. We call these phases HOCA-generated SPT (HGSPT) phases. Specifically, we show that HOCA can generate not only well-understood SPTs with symmetries supported on either regular (e.g., line-like subsystems in the 2D cluster model) or fractal subsystems, but also a large class of unexplored SPTs with symmetries supported on more choices of subsystems. One example is \textit{mixed-subsystem SPT} that has either fractal and line-like subsystem symmetries simultaneously or two distinct types of fractal symmetries simultaneously. Another example is \textit{chaotic-subsystem SPT} in which chaotic-looking symmetries are significantly different from and thus cannot reduce to fractal or regular subsystem symmetries. We also introduce a new notation system to characterize HGSPTs. We prove that all possible subsystem symmetries in square lattice can be locally simulated by an HOCA generated symmetry. As the usual two-point strange correlators are trivial in most HGSPTs, we find that the nontrivial SPT orders can be detected by what we call \textit{multi-point strange correlators}. We propose a universal procedure to design the spatial configuration of the multi-point strange correlators for a given HGSPT phase. Specifically, we find deep connections between multi-point strange correlators and the spurious topological entanglement entropy (STEE), both exhibiting long range behavior in SRE states.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product Operator Method in the Steady State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for quantum impurity problems, which directly works in the steady state. The method embraces the well-established infinite matrix product state algorithms with the recently developed GTEMPO method, and benefits from both sides: it obtains real-time Green's functions without sampling noises and bath discretization error, it is applicable for any temperature without the sign problem, its computational cost is independent of the transient dynamics and does not scale with the number of baths. We benchmark the method on the finite-temperature equilibrium Green's function in the noninteracting limit against exact solutions and in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model against GTEMPO calculations. We also study the zero-temperature non-equilibrium steady state of an impurity coupled to two baths with a voltage bias, obtaining consistent particle currents with existing calculations. The method is ideal for studying steady-state quantum transport, and can be readily used as an efficient real-time impurity solver in the dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.</description>

      <title>Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability for Canonical and non-Canonical Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstract We extend the Carath\'{e}odory principle of the Second Law to quantum thermodynamics with energy levels depending on macroscopic variables, such as volume and magnetic field. This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical states from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Circular Dichroism in Multiphoton Ionization of Resonantly Excited Helium Ions near Channel Closing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The circular dichroism (CD) of photoelectrons generated by near-infrared (NIR) laser pulses using multiphoton ionization of excited He$^+$ ions in the 3p(m=+1) state. The ions were prepared by circularly polarized extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses. For circularly polarized NIR pulses co- and counter-rotating relative to the polarization of the XUV pulse, a complex variation of the CD is observed as a result of intensity- and polarization-dependent Freeman resonances, with and without additional dichroic AC-Stark shifts. The experimental results are compared with numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation to identify and interpret the pronounced variation of the experimentally observed CD.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Network Instrument: Measuring PQC Adoption Rates and Identifying Migration Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic network protocols or post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is critically important to democratizing quantum computing. The problem is urgent because practical quantum computers will break classical encryption in the next few decades. Past encrypted data has already been collected and can be decrypted in the near future. The main challenges of adopting post-quantum cryptography lie in algorithmic complexity and hardware/software/network implementation. The grand question of how existing cyberinfrastructure will support post-quantum cryptography remains unanswered.
  This paper describes: i) the design of a novel Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) network instrument placed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a part of the FABRIC testbed; ii) the latest results on PQC adoption rate across a wide spectrum of network protocols (Secure Shell -- SSH, Transport Layer Security -- TLS, etc.); iii) the current state of PQC implementation in key scientific applications (e.g., OpenSSH or SciTokens); iv) the challenges of being quantum-resistant; and v) discussion of potential novel attacks.
  This is the first large-scale measurement of PQC adoption at national-scale supercomputing centers and FABRIC testbeds. Our results show that only OpenSSH and Google Chrome have successfully implemented PQC and achieved an initial adoption rate of 0.029% (6,044 out of 20,556,816) for OpenSSH connections at NCSA coming from major Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems (ASes) such as OARNET, GTT, Google Fiber Webpass (U.S.) and Uppsala Lans Landsting (Sweden), with an overall increasing adoption rate year-over-year for 2023-2024. Our analyses identify pathways to migrate current applications to be quantum-resistant.</description>

      <title>A Gallery of Soft Modes: Theory and Experiment at a Ferromagnetic Quantum Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the low-energy excitations in the vicinity of the quantum critical point in LiHoF$_4$, a physical realization of the Transverse Field Ising Model, focusing on the long-range fluctuations which soften to zero energy at the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. Microwave spectroscopy in tunable loop-gap resonator structures identifies and characterizes the soft mode and higher-energy electronuclear states. We study these modes as a function of frequency and magnetic fields applied transverse and parallel to the Ising axis. These are understood in the context of a theoretical model of a soft electronuclear mode that interacts with soft photons as well as soft phonons. We identify competing infrared divergences at the quantum critical point, coming from the photons and the electronuclear soft mode. It is an incomplete cancellation of these divergences that leads to the muted but distinct signatures observed in the experiments. The application of a longitudinal magnetic field gaps the soft mode. Measurements well away from the quantum critical point reveal a set of ``Walker'' modes associated with ferromagnetic domain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Atom-Field-Medium Interactions I: Graded Influence Actions for $N$ Harmonic Atoms in a Dielectric-Altered Quantum Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This series of papers has two broader aims: 1) Construct a theory for multi-partite open quantum systems comprising several layers of structure with self-consistent back-actions. Develop the graded influence action formalism \cite{BehHu10,BH11} to account for the influences of successive sub-layers on the dynamics of the variables of interest. 2) Apply these methods to the study of atom-field-medium interactions and highlight their merits over conventional methods. We consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms (A), interacting with a quantum field (F), scalar here, for simplicity, altered by the presence of a dielectric medium (M). In this paper we use the coarse-grained and stochastic effective actions in the influence functional formalism to derive the stochastic equations for the reduced density matrices of the dynamical variables in the successive layers of structure. The word `graded' refers to the specific ordering of the coarse-graining procedures. Three layers of coarse-graining are performed, firstly, integrating over the common bath of the dielectric oscillators results not only in the appearance of necessary dissipative properties of the dielectric but also essential nuanced features such as nonMarkovian spatial correlations in the dielectric. Secondly, integrating over the medium variables as a whole results in a dielectric-modified quantum field, the influence of the medium on the quantum field manifesting through a frequency-dependent permittivity function. Finally, integrating over this dielectric-altered quantum field which interacts with the idfs of the atoms yields an influence action. From it we obtain the stochastic equation of motion which describes the nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics of the idf of the atoms interacting with a dielectric medium-modified quantum field.</description>
