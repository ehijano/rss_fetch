      <title>Modeling the impact of Climate transition on real estate prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a model to quantify the impact of the climate transition on a property in housing market. We begin by noting that property is an asset in an economy. That economy is organized in sectors, driven by its productivity which is a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the climate transition is declined thanks to the carbon price, a continuous deterministic process. We then extend the sales comparison approach and the income approach to valuate an energy inefficient real estate asset. We obtain its value as the difference between the price of an equivalent efficient building following an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck as well as the actualized renovation costs and the actualized sum of the future additional energy costs. These costs are due to the inefficiency of the building, before an optimal renovation date which depends on the carbon price process. Finally, we carry out simulations based on the French economy and the house price index of France. Our results allow to conclude that the order of magnitude of the depreciation obtained by our model is the same as the empirical observations.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Approach to Importance Sampling and Machine Learning for Efficient Monte Carlo Estimation of Distortion Risk Measures in Black Box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distortion risk measures play a critical role in quantifying risks associated with uncertain outcomes. Accurately estimating these risk measures in the context of computationally expensive simulation models that lack analytical tractability is fundamental to effective risk management and decision making. In this paper, we propose an efficient important sampling method for distortion risk measures in such models that reduces the computational cost through machine learning. We demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the Monte Carlo method in numerical experiments on various distortion risk measures and models.</description>

      <title>Climate-Driven Doubling of Maize Loss Probability in U.S. Crop Insurance: Spatiotemporal Prediction and Possible Policy Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change not only threatens agricultural producers but also strains financial institutions. These important food system actors include government entities tasked with both insuring grower livelihoods and supporting response to continued global warming. We use an artificial neural network to predict future maize yields in the U.S. Corn Belt, finding alarming changes to institutional risk exposure within the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Specifically, our machine learning method anticipates more frequent and more severe yield losses that would result in the annual probability of Yield Protection (YP) claims to more than double at mid-century relative to simulations without continued climate change. Furthermore, our dual finding of relatively unchanged average yields paired with decreasing yield stability reveals targeted opportunities to adjust coverage formulas to include variability. This important structural shift may help regulators support grower adaptation to continued climate change by recognizing the value of risk-reducing strategies such as regenerative agriculture. Altogether, paired with open source interactive tools for deeper investigation, our risk profile simulations fill an actionable gap in current understanding, bridging granular historic yield estimation and climate-informed prediction of future insurer-relevant loss.</description>

      <title>Credit Risk Meets Large Language Models: Building a Risk Indicator from Loan Descriptions in P2P Lending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has emerged as a distinctive financing mechanism, linking borrowers with lenders through online platforms. However, P2P lending faces the challenge of information asymmetry, as lenders often lack sufficient data to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue by leveraging the textual descriptions provided by borrowers during the loan application process. Our methodology involves processing these textual descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM), a powerful tool capable of discerning patterns and semantics within the text. Transfer learning is applied to adapt the LLM to the specific task at hand.
  Our results derived from the analysis of the Lending Club dataset show that the risk score generated by BERT, a widely used LLM, significantly improves the performance of credit risk classifiers. However, the inherent opacity of LLM-based systems, coupled with uncertainties about potential biases, underscores critical considerations for regulatory frameworks and engenders trust-related concerns among end-users, opening new avenues for future research in the dynamic landscape of P2P lending and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>The Merton's Default Risk Model for Public Company</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we developed the Merton's structural model for public companies under an assumption that liabilities of the companies are observed. Using Campbell and Shiller's approximation method, we obtain formulas of risk-neutral equity and liability values and default probabilities for the public companies. Also, the paper provides ML estimators of suggested model's parameters.</description>
