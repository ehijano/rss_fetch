      <title>Dilatancy-induced surface deformation in dense cohesive granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When granular materials with interstitial liquid bridges are sheared in a split-bottom cell, a localized shear band develops, accompanied by a surface elevation. Cohesion, governed by the surface tension of the interstitial liquid, enhances dilatancy in dense cohesive packings, leading to expansion within the shear band and the emergence of a surface elevation. Surface deformation is observed not only in cohesive systems with high particle density and large liquid surface tension, but also in those with lower values of these parameters. The equivalent Bond number arises as a key control parameter for the surface deformation, shaping both the evolution of the surface profile and the packing density. At higher shear rates, inertial effects dominate dilatancy, resulting in less pronounced surface deformation.</description>

      <title>Association and phase transitions in simple models for biological and soft matter condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a set of design principles that link specific features of interparticle interactions to predictable structural and dynamic outcomes in two-dimensional self-assembly, a framework relevant to soft matter and biological condensates. Using extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations of single- and two-component systems, we systematically dissect how modifications to competing short-range attraction and long-range repulsion (SALR) potentials (both isotropic and anisotropic) serve as independent control parameters. In particular, we have focused on tuning the repulsive barrier height, decorating the attractive well with oscillatory components, and changing particle geometry. We demonstrate that these modifications dictate cluster size distributions, the degree of intra-cluster ordering, the geometry of the clusters, and the propensity for inter-cluster crystallization. A key finding is the decoupling of internal and global dynamics: oscillatory wells promote solid-like order within clusters while maintaining liquid-like cluster mobility. Furthermore, we show how asymmetric interactions in a binary SALR mixture can be designed to induce internal phase segregation within condensates. Complementing this, we observe that in anisotropic models in which the short rage component of the interaction stems from the presence of attractive patchy sites, stoichiometry and the geometric distribution of the patches are essential to control self-assembly and cluster morphology, whereas long-range repulsion can be used to tune cluster size and polydispersity. The extracted principles provide a causal road-map for engineering self-assembled materials and a set of basic physical concepts for interpreting the complex phase behavior of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal visual perception and polar alignment drive collective states in chiral active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles rarely move in straight lines; environmental interactions, shape asymmetry, and intrinsic torques generically induce curved or fluctuating trajectories. In biological and synthetic systems, this curvature often coexists with directional sensing and non-reciprocal interactions. Motivated by this, we explore the collective dynamics of chiral intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) that combine polar alignment with vision-based sensing. By varying the ratio of alignment to visual maneuverability, the vision angle, and the reduced chirality $(\omega/D_r)$, we construct a phase diagram exhibiting diverse collective states: spinners, vortices, ripples, worm-like swarms, rotary clusters, and irregular aggregates. Chirality critically governs their morphology: high chirality yields dilute phases, while moderate to low chirality produces cohesive yet dynamic patterns. Ripple loops emerge as a distinct state, characterized by expanding ring-like motion driven by outward torques and sustained only when both particle number and visual maneuverability are large. Structural and dynamical measures, including polarization, pair correlations, mean-square displacement, and orientation correlations, reveal clear signatures distinguishing these phases. Overall, our results show how chirality, non-reciprocal perception, and alignment together generate collective states inaccessible to non-chiral systems, with implications for chiral active matter in biological and synthetic contexts.</description>

      <title>Dense granular rheology from fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unifying framework to describe dense flows of dry, deformable grains is proposed. Perturbative analysis of a granular temperature equation describing flows with contact stresses, supported by the recovery of the nonlocal granular fluidity equation, is used to derive an expression for a recently postulated critical exponent. Direct numerical simulation justifies models for the unclosed terms that provide a material-dependent estimate. Non-universality of the velocity and strain rate distributions, arising from competition between production and diffusion, rationalizes model shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Static Kuhn Length: Conformational Substructures and Relaxation Dynamics in Flexible Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical "monomer-based" segment length $b$ and the Kuhn length $l_k$ are central to polymer physics, yet the minimal size required for a truly statistical segment - Gaussian, uncorrelated, and valid as an entropic spring - is not rigorously established. Using atomistic simulations of entangled polyethylene, we re-evaluate these foundational quantities.
  By fitting end-to-end distance distributions of C--C bond blocks and validating with higher-moment analyses, we identify for the first time the minimal sizes corresponding to a statistical segment and an entropic spring. A single Kuhn segment (approximately 11 bonds) is the smallest statistically uncorrelated unit, but its distance distribution is strongly non-Gaussian, while the monomer-based segment $b$, used in rheology and classical tube-theory formulations, is not statistical at all. True Gaussianity emerges only for blocks containing multiple Kuhn segments.
  At the Kuhn scale, we uncover a previously unresolved conformational heterogeneity. Each segment samples a broad range of conformations, from coiled (approximately 4~\AA) to extended (approximately 14~\AA), giving rise to three distinct substructures: aligned chain segments (ACS), random conformational sequences (RCS), and chain ends (CE). These exhibit distinct dynamical signatures. ACS relax with a stretched-exponential exponent $\beta \approx 0.5$, consistent with quasi-one-dimensional, defect-mediated localized modes, whereas RCS and CE relax with $\beta \approx 0.7$. By connecting these results to localized-mode theory and continuous-time random-walk models, we provide a molecular interpretation of stretched-exponential relaxation in polymer melts.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of macroscopic contractility in actin-myosin active gel models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actin filaments, crosslinkers and myosin molecular motors form contractile networks. For instance, the cell cortex is a thin network below the cell membrane ; contraction of the cell cortex allows cells to round up during cell division. Contractile actin-myosin networks are often represented at large scale by continuous theories such as active gel models. However, experimental perturbations are microscopic while parameters in continuous models are macroscopic, thus making those models hard to falsify experimentally. Here we use numerical simulations, in which we can access both microscopic and macroscopic quantities, to show that active gel models can indeed be applied to describe contractile actin. We predict that contractile stress should scale linearly with actin density, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, we can accurately predict how the contractile stress depends on motor properties such as unloaded speed and stall force.</description>

      <title>Learning Hydro-Phoretic Interactions in Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest to understand large-scale collective behavior in active matter, the complexity of hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions remains a fundamental challenge. To date, most works either focus on minimal models that do not (fully) account for these interactions, or explore relatively small systems. The present work develops a generic method that combines high-fidelity simulations with symmetry-preserving descriptors and neural networks to predict hydro-phoretic interactions directly from particle coordinates (effective interactions). This method enables, for the first time, self-contained particle-only simulations and theories with full hydro-phoretic pair interactions.</description>

      <title>Colloidal Suspensions can have Non-Zero Angles of Repose below the Minimal Value for Athermal Frictionless Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the angle of repose ${\theta}_r$ of dense suspensions of colloidal silica particles ($d = 2$ $\mu m$ to $7$ $\mu m$) in water-filled microfluidic rotating drums experiments, to probe the crossover between the thermal (colloidal) and athermal (granular) regimes. For the smallest particles, thermal agitation promotes slow creep flows, and piles always flatten completely regardless of their initial inclination angle, resulting in ${\theta}_r = 0$. Above a critical particle size, piles of colloids stop flowing at a finite angle of repose, which increases with particle size but remains below the minimal value expected for athermal frictionless granular materials: $0 &lt; {\theta}_r &lt; {\theta}_{ath} \approx 5.8{\deg}$. We quantify the arrest dynamics as a function of the gravitational P\'eclet number $Pe_g$, which characterizes the competition between particle weight and thermal agitation. Our measurements are consistent with a recent rheological model [Billon et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 034302, 2023], in which the arrested state stems from a crossover between glass-like and jamming-dominated regimes as the granular pressure in the pile increases relative to the thermal pressure.</description>

      <title>Molecular simulation of methane hydrate growth confined into a silica pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of a methane hydrate seed within a silica slit pore of fixed width has been studied using AllAtom Molecular Dynamics (AA-MD). An AA force field has been used to describe the molecules of the solid silica substrate, with a-quartz crystalline structure. The crystallisation of hydrates in confined geometries is not well understood yet, and the objective of this work is to study the hydrate growth inside a silica pore using molecular simulation. Both NVT and NpT ensembles were used in the AA-MD simulations to analyse the hydrate growth from an initial seed. Results showed that the boundary conditions imposed by the nanometric slit pore yielded a hydrate with structural defects, filling the accessible space between the silica walls. The water molecules which were not incorporated to the initial seed hydrate formed a high density water layer trapped between the silica walls and the crystallised hydrate. These results provide an interesting insight into the hydrate crystallisation process in confined geometries, resembling those found in natural hydrate deposits.</description>

      <title>Excess energy of strongly coupled one-component plasma from variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excess energy of the one-component plasma fluid is calculated using the variational approach combined with different variants of the excess entropy of the hard-sphere fluid, which is used as a reference system. Our comparison with recent Monte Carlo results for the excess energy of the one-component plasma identifies the Percus-Yevick virial entropy as the most accurate entropy to be used in the variational calculation of this kind. The reason for this and potential developments of the present analysis are briefly discussed. We demonstrate that the original Rosenfeld-Tarazons scaling of the thermal component of the excess energy of the one-component plasma fluid is in excellent agreement with recent Monte Carlo results.</description>

      <title>Liquid-vapor critical behavior of the TIP4P/2005 water model: effects of NaCl solutes and hydrophobic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The liquid-vapor critical behavior of water is strongly influenced by both ionic solutes and confinement. Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous NaCl solutions using the TIP4P/2005 water model and the Madrid-2019 ion parameters reveal a systematic increase in the liquid-vapor critical temperature and pressure with salt concentration, consistent with experimental trends. In contrast, confinement between parallel hydrophobic plates leads to a depression of the critical point. The critical temperature was determined from the Binder cumulant crossing in the NVT ensemble, using a recently developed method originally applied to an active Brownian particle system. The reliability of this approach was verified through complementary NPT simulations. We further demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the estimated critical point to the van der Waals cutoff distance, underscoring the importance of properly accounting for long-range interactions. Our framework, which employs and tests an adjusted subbox method, can be readily extended to other critical phenomena, including the liquid-liquid critical point of water.</description>

      <title>A bottom-up approach to fluctuating hydrodynamics: Coarse-graining of stochastic lattice gases and the Dean-Kawasaki equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a quantitative, large-scale description of many-body systems in terms of smooth variables, with microscopic details entering only through a small set of transport coefficients. Although this framework has been highly successful in characterizing macroscopic fluctuations and correlations, a systematic derivation of fluctuating hydrodynamics from underlying stochastic microscopic dynamics remains obscure for broad classes of interacting systems. For stochastic lattice gas models with gradient dynamics and a single conserved density, we develop a path-integral based coarse-graining procedure that recovers fluctuating hydrodynamics in a controlled manner. Our analysis highlights the essential role of local-equilibrium averages, which go beyond na\"ive mean-field-type gradient expansions. We further extend this approach to interacting Brownian particles by coarse-graining the Dean-Kawasaki equation, revealing a mobility proportional to the density and a diffusivity determined by the thermodynamic pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After rainfall, pine needles often float on the surface of small puddles. As the water evaporates, they self-assemble into distinct clusters. Motivated by this natural phenomenon, we experimentally investigate the dynamic evolution of synthetic particles as the liquid surface shrinks in area. Our experiments demonstrate the tendency of particles to aggregate, forming distinct clusters as the liquid boundary shrinks. We systematically examine the emergence of these clusters and explore how their sizes and numbers evolve with changes in packing fraction. We also analyze particle rotation during the process and discuss the formation of the final configuration comprising clusters of various orientations. Complementary numerical simulations demonstrate qualitative agreement with our experimental findings. This study sheds additional light on the self-assembly of macroscopic particles in a dynamically evolving medium.</description>

      <title>Proliferating Nematic That Collectively Senses an Anisotropic Substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on growing fibroblasts, we examine the development of nematic order in a colony of elongated cells proliferating on a nematic elastomer substrate. After sparse seeding, the cells divide and grow into locally ordered, but randomly oriented, domains that then interact with each other and the substrate. Global alignment with the substrate is only achieved above a critical density, suggesting a collective mechanism for the sensing of substrate anisotropy. The system jams at high density, where both reorientation and proliferation stop. Using a continuum model of a proliferating nematic liquid crystal, we examine the competition between growth-driven alignment and substrate-driven alignment in controlling the density and structure of the final jammed state. We propose that anisotropic traction forces and the tendency of cells to align perpendicular to the direction of density gradients act in concert to provide a mechanism for collective cell alignment.</description>

      <title>Coupled imbibition and evaporation of droplets deposited on a nanoporous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquids in nanoscale hydrophilic pores generate capillary pressures so large that they could theoretically climb kilometers against gravity. However, droplets on thin nanoporous layers form imbibition fronts stopping at millimeters or less due to evaporation competing with capillary flow. Such droplet infiltration dynamics is of growing interest for studying confined fluids and for applications such as water harvesting, printing, chemical delivery, actuation, and sensing. Here, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the spontaneous imbibition and evaporation of sessile droplets into thin mesoporous layers, focusing on their dependence on imposed relative humidity (RH). Theoretically, we provide a unified analytical approach for the dynamics of the wetted annulus ("halo") around the droplet, accounting for arbitrary halo dimensions and confinement-induced thermodynamic shifts (Kelvin effect). Experimentally, we study water droplets on oxidized porous silicon layers (pore diameter 3-4 nm, thickness 5 $\mu$m), systematically investigating how halo and droplet dynamics depend on RH. We show that halo formation timescales diverge at a critical RH due to the Kelvin effect, as illustrated by comparing RH-dependent evaporation rates in the halo (confined liquid) and in the droplet (bulk liquid). Our analysis also reveals an apparent divergence of the imbibition coefficient, unexplained by standard capillary models, suggesting a key role for Kelvin-driven vapor transport along the porous surface. The complex couplings revealed by our study call for caution in interpreting halo dynamics data. Our results also highlight RH as a powerful control parameter for tuning droplet imbibition behavior and infiltration patterns.</description>

      <title>Collective bacterial motion drives interfacial waves and shape dynamics in phase-separated droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation is important across biology, physics, and materials science. Although usually studied at equilibrium, active components - such as motor proteins, enzymes, and synthetic microswimmers - are increasingly recognized as key players in reshaping phase separation dynamics. Here, we encapsulate motile bacteria inside phase-separated aqueous droplets to investigate how internal activity alters interfacial behavior. By varying bacterial density, we control the active stress at the droplet interface. At low activity, we observe scale-dependent interfacial fluctuations that propagate as waves. In this low Reynolds number regime, these waves arise from an effective inertial response, generated when active bacterial stresses balance passive viscous damping of the interface. At higher activity, droplets deform strongly - exceeding the Plateau-Rayleigh instability threshold - and even form cell-sized filaments - a morphology without a passive counterpart. Enhanced droplet motility and accelerated coarsening accompany these shape changes. Our work shows how active stresses can reshape the morphology and dynamics of multiphase systems, offering new insight into the physics of internally driven phase-separated fluids.</description>

      <title>Information supercurrents and spin waves in chiral active matter: Universality of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling indicates that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results show that all polar chiral agents who seek to align on the unit sphere strictly constitute a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>An elasto-viscoplastic thixotropic model for fresh concrete capturing flow-rest transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects.</description>

      <title>Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Non-algebraic first return probability of a stretched random walk near a convex boundary and its effect on adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $N$-step random walk, elongated in the vicinity of a disc (in 2D) or a sphere (in 3D) of radius $R$, demonstrates a non-algebraic stretched exponential decay $P_N\sim \exp\left(-{\rm const}\, N^{1/3}\right)$ for the first return probability $P_N$ in the double-scaling limit $N=\frac{L}{a}\gg 1, \frac{R}{a}\gg 1$ conditioned that $\frac{L}{R}=c={\rm const}$. Stretching means that the length of the walk, $L=Na$ (where $a$ is the unit step length) satisfies the condition $L = cR$, where $c &gt; \pi$ and under "first return" we understand the radial first arrival to a boundary. Both analytic and numerical evidences of the non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ are provided. Considering the model of a polymer loop stretched ("inflated") by external force, we show that non-algebraic behavior of $P_N$ affects the adsorption of a polymer at the boundary of a sticky disc in 2D, manifesting in a first order localization transition.</description>

      <title>Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: Part I -- Phenomenological descriptions and microscopic models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtually every biological rate depends on temperature, yet the resulting rate-temperature relationships often deviate strongly from simple Arrhenius behavior. In this first part of a two-part review, we survey empirical and phenomenological models used to describe biological temperature responses across scales, from enzymatic reactions to organismal performance. We discuss common functional forms, including symmetric and asymmetric thermal performance curves and extensions of the Arrhenius law, and we highlight how these models define operational quantities such as optimal temperatures, thermal breadths, and thermal limits. In Part II of this review, we will discuss how system-level temperature response curves emerge from the interaction of many underlying reactions.</description>

      <title>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>

      <title>Hidden long-range correlations in the ion distribution at the graphite / [bmim][NTf$_2$] electrified interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A capacitor consisting of the [bmim][NTf$_2$] ionic liquid (IL) confined in between planar graphite electrodes has been investigated by molecular dynamics based on an all-atom, unpolarizable force field. Structural and dynamical properties such as: (i) the density and orientation of the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions throughout the capacitor; (ii) the electrostatic double layer at the electrode / electrolyte interface; (iii) the ions' mobility perpendicular and parallel to the graphite plates are determined as a function of the electrostatic charge of the capacitor, the concentration of absorbed water, the temperature and pressure. Grouping the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions into neutral ion pairs reveals an intriguing ordering normal to the interface that is related to correlations among the dipole moments of the neutral ion pairs. These correlations might explain the observation of an anomalous Stark effect (Pockels effect) reported a few years ago in Langmuir, vol. 37, 5193-5201, (2021), and provides useful insight for the multitude of electro-chemical applications that involve electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.</description>
