      <title>Broadband, Flexible, Skin-Compatible Carbon Dots/Graphene Photodetectors for Wearable Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of wearable photodetectors demands a unique combination of broadband optical sensitivity, mechanical flexibility, and skin-compatibility, with these requirements rarely met simultaneously by existing technologies. Here, we present photodetectors that combine all of these performances. This is achieved by integrating carbon dots, engineered for extended ultraviolet-to-near-infrared absorption, with single-layer graphene transferred onto a plastic substrate. Unlike traditional quantum dot systems, our carbon dots achieve a broad ultraviolet-to-near-infrared response without toxic heavy metals. Graphene provides an efficient channel for charge transport, while a biocompatible chitosan-glycerol electrolyte enables efficient, low-voltage carrier modulation, with peak performance at approximately 0.5 V gate bias. The resulting photodetectors exhibit a broadband photoresponse with responsivities of approximately 0.19 A/W at 406 nm, 0.32 A/W at 642 nm, and 0.18 A/W at 785 nm. They maintain consistent performance at a bending radius of 0.8 cm with negligible degradation after repeated cycles. Furthermore, skin-compatibility assessments using the SkinEthic model confirm the non-toxic nature and suitability of our devices for direct skin contact. The combination of broadband absorption (400-800 nm), flexibility, and skin-compatibility, along with low-voltage operation ($&lt;$ 1.5 V), positions our photodetectors as promising building blocks for next-generation wearable optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Probing the spectral width of the 12.4-keV solid-state $^{45}$Sc isomeric resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms. These findings set new experimental benchmarks for solid-state nuclear clock development.</description>

      <title>Incompressible quantum liquid on the four-dimensional sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explo- rations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four-dimensional (4D) QHE has been experi- mentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.</description>

      <title>Architecting mechanisms of damage in topological metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behaviour of non-idealised Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. We numerically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in a cluster spin chain coupled with free spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05937v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Angular Momentum Generation in Thermally Driven Chiral Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The appearance of angular momentum in the nuclear motion of molecular systems lacking inversion symmetry under imposed thermal gradients presents a novel mechanism with potential implications for spintronics, magnetic response, and energy transport in such systems. Here we explore this phenomenon, using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study angular momentum generation in several driven chiral molecular models. We demonstrate that significant vibrational angular momentum can be induced under both mechanical and thermal driving, with magnitude comparable to that induced in optically driven chiral phonons. We find that generation of angular momentum is a common and general phenomenon in driven chiral structures, highlighting the role of symmetry-breaking in the (non-equilibrium) internal atomic motion of such systems.</description>

      <title>Translation Groups for arbitrary Gauge Fields in Synthetic Crystals with real hopping amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cayley-crystals introduced in [F. R. Lux and E. Prodan, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 25(8), 3563 (2024)] are a class of lattices endowed with a Hamiltonian whose translation group $G$ is generic and possibly non-commutative. We show that these systems naturally realize the generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary discrete gauge groups. A one-body dynamics emulates that of a particle carrying a superposition of charges, each coupled to distinct static gauge-field configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup $C \subset G$, while the Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the embedding of $C$ in $G$. The role of other subgroups in shaping both the lattice geometry and the dynamics is analyze in depth assuming $C$ finite. We discuss a theorem of direct engineering relevance that, for any cyclic gauge group, yields all compatible translation groups. We then construct two-dimensional examples of Cayley-crystals equivalent to square lattices threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Importantly, Cayley-crystals can be realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms.</description>
