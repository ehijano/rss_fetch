      <title>Reservoir Computing with a Single Oscillating Gas Bubble: Emphasizing the Chaotic Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of artificial intelligence systems urge the exploration of alternative software and hardware solutions that exploit physical effects for computation. According to machine learning theory, a neural network-based computational system must exhibit nonlinearity to effectively model complex patterns and relationships. This requirement has driven extensive research into various nonlinear physical systems to enhance the performance of neural networks. In this paper, we propose and theoretically validate a reservoir computing system based on a single bubble trapped within a bulk of liquid. By applying an external acoustic pressure wave to both encode input information and excite the complex nonlinear dynamics, we showcase the ability of this single-bubble reservoir computing system to forecast complex benchmarking time series and undertake classification tasks with high accuracy. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chaotic physical regime of bubble oscillation proves to be the most effective for this kind of computations.</description>

      <title>Bubbling in Oscillator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A network of coupled time-varying systems, where individual nodes are interconnected through links, is a modeling framework widely used by many disciplines. For identical nodes displaying a complex behavior known as chaos, clusters of nodes or the entire network can synchronize for a range of coupling strengths. Here, we demonstrate that small differences in the nodes give rise to desynchronization events, known as bubbling, in regimes where synchronization is expected. Thus, small unit heterogeneity in all real systems has an unexpected and outsized effect on the network dynamics. We present a theoretical analysis of bubbling in chaotic oscillator networks and predict when bubble-free behavior is expected. Our work demonstrates that the domain of network synchronization is much smaller than expected and is replaced by epochs of synchronization interspersed with extreme events. Our findings have important implications for real-world systems where synchronized behavior is crucial for system functionality.</description>

      <title>Physical significance of artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using clean numerical simulation (CNS) in which artificial numerical noise is negligible over a finite, sufficiently long interval of time, we provide evidence, for the first time, that artificial numerical noise in direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence is approximately equivalent to thermal fluctuation and/or stochastic environmental noise. This confers physical significance on the artificial numerical noise of DNS of the Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, DNS on a fine mesh should correspond to turbulence under small internal/external physical disturbance, whereas DNS on a sparse mesh corresponds to turbulent flow under large physical disturbance, respectively. The key point is that: all of them have physical meanings and so are correct in terms of their deterministic physics, even if their statistics are quite different. This is illustrated herein. Our paper provides a positive viewpoint regarding the presence of artificial numerical noise in DNS.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of magnetized turbulence in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy is magnetized, compressible and turbulent, influencing many key ISM properties, like star formation, cosmic ray transport, and metal and phase mixing. Yet, basic statistics describing compressible, magnetized turbulence remain uncertain. Utilizing grid resolutions up to $10,080^3$ cells, we simulate highly-compressible, magnetized ISM-style turbulence with a magnetic field maintained by a small-scale dynamo. We measure two coexisting kinetic energy cascades, $\mathcal{E}_{{\rm kin}}(k) \propto k^{-n}$, in the turbulence, separating the plasma into scales that are non-locally interacting, supersonic and weakly magnetized $(n=2.01\pm 0.03\approx 2)$ and locally interacting, subsonic and highly magnetized $(n=1.465\pm 0.002\approx 3/2)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. We show that the $3/2$ spectrum can be explained with scale-dependent kinetic energy fluxes and velocity-magnetic field alignment. On the highly magnetized modes, the magnetic energy spectrum forms a local cascade $(n=1.798\pm 0.001\approx 9/5)$, deviating from any known \textit{ab initio} theory. With a new generation of radio telescopes coming online, these results provide a means to directly test if the ISM in our Galaxy is maintained by the compressible turbulent motions from within it.</description>

      <title>Observable-manifested correlations in many-body quantum chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distinctions between realistic quantum chaotic systems and random models from the perspective of observable properties, particularly focusing on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Through numerical simulations, we find that for realistic systems, the envelope function of off-diagonal elements of observables exhibits an exponential decay at large $\Delta E$, while for randomized models, it tends to be flat. We demonstrate that the correlations of chaotic eigenstates, originating from the delicate structures of Hamiltonians, play a crucial role in the non-trivial structure of the envelope function. Furthermore, we analyze the numerical results from the perspective of the dynamical group elements in Hamiltonians. Our findings highlight the importance of correlations in physical chaotic systems and provide insights into the deviations from RMT predictions. These understandings offer valuable directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Remote Synchronization: An Experimental Approach with Nonlinear Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates remote synchronization in arbitrary network clusters of coupled nonlinear oscillators, a phenomenon inspired by neural synchronization in the brain. Employing a multi-faceted approach encompassing analytical, numerical, and experimental methodologies, we leverage the Master Stability Function (MSF) to analyze network stability. We provide experimental evidence of remote synchronization between two clusters of nonlinear oscillators, where oscillators within each cluster are also remotely connected. This observation parallels the thalamus-mediated synchronization of neuronal populations in the brain. An electronic circuit testbed, supported by nonlinear ODE modeling and LT Spice simulation, was developed to validate our theoretical predictions. Future work will extend this investigation to encompass diverse network topologies and explore potential applications in neuroscience, communication networks, and power systems.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a charged confining holographic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a recently constructed charged confining holographic background. The confining background corresponds to the charged soliton, which is a solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. The solution has a compact spacelike direction with a Wilson line on a circle and asymptotes to $AdS_5$ with a planar boundary. For the classical case, we analyze the chaos using the power spectrum, Poincar\'{e} sections, and Lyapunov exponents, finding that both energy and charge play constructive effects on enhancing the chaotic nature of the system. We similarly analyze quantum chaos using the distribution of the spectrum's level-spacing and out-of-time-ordered correlators and thoroughly investigate the effects of charge and energy. A gradual transition from a chaotic to an integrable regime is obtained as the energy and charge increase from lower to higher values, with charge playing a subdominant role.</description>
