      <title>Finding the Best Route During the Pandemic Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a mathematical model for identifying the safest travel routes during a pandemic by minimizing disease contraction risks, such as COVID-19. We formulate this as the LEAST INFECTION PROBABILITY PATH (LIPP) problem, which optimizes routes between two nodes in a transportation network based on minimal disease transmission probability. Our model evaluates risk factors including environmental density, likelihood of encountering carriers, and exposure duration across multiple transportation modes (walking, subway, BRT, buses, and cars). The probabilistic framework incorporates additional variables such as ventilation quality, activity levels, and interpersonal distances to estimate transmission risks. Applied to Tehran's transportation network using routing applications (Neshan and Balad), our model demonstrates that combined pedestrian-subway-BRT routes exhibit significantly lower infection risks compared to car or bus routes, as illustrated in our case study of peak-hour travel between Sadeghiyeh Square and Amirkabir University. We develop a practical routing algorithm suitable for integration with existing navigation software to provide pandemic-aware path recommendations. Potential future extensions include incorporating additional variables like waiting times and line changes, as well as adapting the model for other infectious diseases. This research offers a valuable tool for urban travelers seeking to minimize infection risks during pandemic conditions.</description>

      <title>A computational framework for quantifying route diversification in road networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of road networks impacts various urban dynamics, from traffic congestion to environmental sustainability and access to essential services. Recent studies reveal that most roads are underutilized, faster alternative routes are often overlooked, and traffic is typically concentrated on a few corridors. In this article, we examine how road network structure, and in particular the presence of mobility attractors (e.g., highways and ring roads), shapes the counterpart to traffic concentration: route diversification. To this end, we introduce DiverCity, a measure that quantifies the extent to which traffic can potentially be distributed across multiple, loosely overlapping near-shortest routes. Analyzing 56 diverse global cities, we find that DiverCity is influenced by network characteristics and is associated with traffic efficiency. Within cities, DiverCity increases with distance from the city center before stabilizing in the periphery, but declines in the proximity of mobility attractors. We demonstrate that strategic speed limit adjustments on mobility attractors can increase DiverCity while preserving travel efficiency. We isolate the complex interplay between mobility attractors and DiverCity through simulations in a controlled setting, confirming the patterns observed in real-world cities. DiverCity provides a practical tool for urban planners and policymakers to optimize road network design and balance route diversification, efficiency, and sustainability. We provide an interactive platform (https://divercitymaps.github.io) to visualize the spatial distribution of DiverCity across all considered cities.</description>

      <title>From Motifs to L\'evy Flights: Modeling Urban Mobility in Bogot\'a's Public Transport System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two years of access card validation records from Bogot\'a's multimodal public transport system, comprising over 2.3 billion trips across bus rapid transit, feeder buses, dual-service buses, and an aerial cable network. By reconstructing user trajectories as motifs, we identify recurrent mobility patterns that extend beyond simple round trips, enabling the construction of an integrated origin-destination (OD) matrix covering 2,828 urban zones. Similarity analysis using the Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the temporal stability of mobility structures across semesters, despite infrastructure changes and fare policy adjustments. From the obtained OD matrices, we derive transition probabilities between zones and uncover a robust power-law relationship with geographical distance, consistent with L\'evy flight dynamics. We validate our model using Monte Carlo simulations showing that reproduces both local and long-range displacements, with similar scaling exponents across time. These findings demonstrate that Bogot\'a's public transport mobility can be effectively modeled through L\'evy processes, providing a novel framework for analyzing complex transportation systems based solely on user access records.</description>

      <title>Homophily-induced Emergence of Biased Structures in LLM-based Multi-Agent AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how interactions among artificially intelligent (AI) agents, guided by large language models (LLMs), drive the evolution of collective network structures. We ask LLM-driven agents to grow a network by informing them about current link constellations. Our observations confirm that agents consistently apply a preferential attachment mechanism, favoring connections to nodes with higher degrees. We systematically solicited more than a million decisions from four different LLMs, including Gemini, ChatGPT, Llama, and Claude. When social attributes such as age, gender, religion, and political orientation are incorporated, the resulting networks exhibit heightened assortativity, leading to the formation of distinct homophilic communities. This significantly alters the network topology from what would be expected under a pure preferential attachment model alone. Political and religious attributes most significantly fragment the collective, fostering polarized subgroups, while age and gender yield more gradual structural shifts. Strikingly, LLMs also reveal asymmetric patterns in heterophilous ties, suggesting embedded directional biases reflective of societal norms. As autonomous AI agents increasingly shape the architecture of online systems, these findings contribute to how algorithmic choices of generative AI collectives not only reshape network topology, but offer critical insights into how AI-driven systems co-evolve and self-organize.</description>

      <title>Dynamic roughening of cities driven by multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of urban landscapes is rapidly altering the surface of our planet. Yet, our understanding of the urbanisation phenomenon remains far from complete. A fundamental challenge is to describe spatiotemporal changes in the built environment. A dynamic theory of urban evolution should account for both vertical and horizontal city expansion, analogous to the dynamical behaviour of surface growth in physical and biological systems. Here we show that building-height dynamics in cities around the world are well described by a zero-dimensional geometric Brownian motion (GBM), where multiplicative noise drives stochastic fluctuations around a deterministic drift associated with economic growth. To account for intra-city correlations, we extend the GBM with spatial coupling, revealing how local interactions effectively mitigate noise-driven fluctuations and shape urban morphology. The continuum limit of this spatial model can be recasted into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and we find that empirical estimates of the roughness exponent are in the range of the KPZ prediction for most cities. Together, these results show that multiplicative noise, moderated by local interactions, governs the evolution of urban roughness, anchoring spatiotemporal city dynamics in a well-established statistical physics framework.</description>

      <title>Modeling the spatial growth of cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of cities has traditionally been studied from a population perspective, while urban sprawl - its spatial growth - has often been approached qualitatively. However, characterizing and modeling this spatial expansion is crucial, particularly given its parallels with surface growth extensively studied in physics. Despite these similarities, approaches to urban sprawl modeling are fragmented and scattered across various disciplines and contexts. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mathematical modeling of this complex phenomenon. We discuss the key challenges hindering progress and examine models inspired by statistical physics, economics and geography, and theoretical ecology. Finally, we highlight critical directions for future research in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Scalable analysis of stop-and-go waves: Representation, measurements and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing stop-and-go waves at the scale of miles and hours of data is an emerging challenge in traffic research. The past 5 years have seen an explosion in the availability of large-scale traffic data containing traffic waves and complex congestion patterns, making existing approaches unsuitable for repeatable and scalable analysis of traffic waves in these data. This paper makes a first step towards addressing this challenge by introducing an automatic and scalable stop-and-go wave identification method capable of capturing wave generation, propagation, dissipation, as well as bifurcation and merging, which have previously been observed only very rarely. Using a concise and simple critical-speed based definition of a stop-and-go wave, the proposed method identifies all wave boundaries that encompass spatio-temporal points where vehicle speed is below a chosen critical speed. The method is built upon a graph representation of the spatio-temporal points associated with stop-and-go waves, specifically wave front (start) points and wave tail (end) points, and approaches the solution as a graph component identification problem. It enables the measurement of wave properties at scale. The method is implemented in Python and demonstrated on a large-scale dataset, I-24 MOTION INCEPTION. Our results show insights on the complexity of traffic waves. Traffic waves can bifurcate and merge at a scale that has never been observed or described before. The clustering analysis of all the identified wave components reveals the different topological structures of traffic waves. We explored that the wave merge or bifurcation points can be explained by spatial features. The gallery of all the identified wave topologies is demonstrated at https://trafficwaves.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Can Machines Philosophize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the Turing test, we present a novel methodological framework to assess the extent to which a population of machines mirrors the philosophical views of a population of humans. The framework consists of three steps: (i) instructing machines to impersonate each human in the population, reflecting their backgrounds and beliefs, (ii) administering a questionnaire covering various philosophical positions to both humans and machines, and (iii) statistically analyzing the resulting responses. We apply this methodology to the debate on scientific realism, a long-standing philosophical inquiry exploring the relationship between science and reality. By considering the outcome of a survey of over 500 human participants, including both physicists and philosophers of science, we generate their machine personas using an artificial intelligence engine based on a large language model. We reveal that the philosophical views of a population of machines are, on average, similar to those endorsed by a population of humans, irrespective of whether they are physicists or philosophers of science. As compared to humans, however, machines exhibit a weaker inclination toward scientific realism and a stronger coherence in their philosophical positions. Given the observed similarities between the populations of humans and machines, this methodological framework may offer unprecedented opportunities for advancing research in the empirical social sciences by complementing human participants with their machine-impersonated counterparts.</description>

      <title>Physical partisan proximity outweighs online ties in predicting US voting outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affective polarization and increasing social divisions affect social mixing and the spread of information across online and physical spaces, reinforcing social and electoral cleavages and influencing political outcomes. Here, using individual survey data and aggregated and de-identified co-location and online network data, we investigate the relationship between partisan exposure and vote choice in the US by comparing offline and online dimensions of partisan exposure. By leveraging various statistical modeling approaches, we consistently find that partisan exposure in the physical space, as captured by co-location patterns, more accurately predicts electoral outcomes in US counties, outperforming online and residential exposures. Similarly, offline ties at the individual level better predict vote choice compared to online connections. We also estimate county-level experienced partisan segregation and examine its relationship with individuals' demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Focusing on metropolitan areas, our results confirm the presence of extensive partisan segregation in the US and show that offline partisan isolation, both considering physical encounters or residential sorting, is higher than online segregation and is primarily associated with educational attainment. Our findings emphasize the importance of physical space in understanding the relationship between social networks and political behavior, in contrast to the intense scrutiny focused on online social networks and elections.</description>
