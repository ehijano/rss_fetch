      <title>First Measurement of the $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ Interaction Cross Sections at the LHC with FASER's Emulsion Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first results of the study of high-energy electron and muon neutrino charged-current interactions in the FASER$\nu$ emulsion/tungsten detector of the FASER experiment at the LHC. A subset of the FASER$\nu$ volume, which corresponds to a target mass of 128.6~kg, was exposed to neutrinos from the LHC $pp$ collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of 13.6~TeV and an integrated luminosity of 9.5 fb$^{-1}$. Applying stringent selections requiring electrons with reconstructed energy above 200~GeV, four electron neutrino interaction candidate events are observed with an expected background of $0.025^{+0.015}_{-0.010}$, leading to a statistical significance of 5.2$\sigma$. This is the first direct observation of electron neutrino interactions at a particle collider. Eight muon neutrino interaction candidate events are also detected, with an expected background of $0.22^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$, leading to a statistical significance of 5.7$\sigma$. The signal events include neutrinos with energies in the TeV range, the highest-energy electron and muon neutrinos ever detected from an artificial source. The energy-independent part of the interaction cross section per nucleon is measured over an energy range of 560--1740 GeV (520--1760 GeV) for $\nu_e$ ($\nu_{\mu}$) to be $(1.2_{-0.7}^{+0.8}) \times 10^{-38}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ ($(0.5\pm0.2) \times 10^{-38}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$), consistent with Standard Model predictions. These are the first measurements of neutrino interaction cross sections in those energy ranges.</description>

      <title>Searching for Lepton Flavor Violation with the CMS Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for lepton flavor violation (LFV) stand at the forefront of experimental particle physics research, offering a sensitive probe to many scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model. The high proton-proton collision energy and luminosity provided by the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the excellent CMS detector performance allow for an extensive program of LFV searches. This article reviews a broad range of LFV searches conducted at the CMS experiment using data collected in LHC Run 2, including $\tau\to3\mu$ decays, Higgs boson decays, and top quark production and decays. In each analysis, the online and offline event selections, signal modeling, background suppression and estimation, and statistical interpretation are elucidated. These searches involve various final state particles in a large transverse momentum range, showcasing the capability of the CMS experiment in exploring fundamental questions in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Measurement of vector boson production cross sections and their ratios using $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiducial and total $W^\pm$ and $Z$ boson cross sections, their ratios and the ratio of top-antitop-quark pair and $W$-boson fiducial cross sections are measured in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 29 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in 2022 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The measured fiducial cross-section values for $W^+\to \ell^+\nu$, $W^-\to \ell^-\bar{\nu}$, and $Z\to \ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=e$ or $\mu$) boson productions are $4250\pm 150$ pb, $3310\pm 120$ pb, and $744\pm 20$ pb, respectively, where the uncertainty is the total uncertainty, including that arising from the luminosity of about 2.2%. The measurements are in agreement with Standard-Model predictions calculated at next-to-next-to-leading-order in $\alpha_s$, next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and next-to-leading-order electroweak accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Imperative study of the angular observables in $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c^{+}(\to \Lambda \pi^{+})\tau \bar{\nu_{\tau}}$ decay and probing the footprint of new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the 4-body angular distribution for $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^{+}(\to \Lambda \pi^{+})\ell^- \bar{\nu}$ decays and find out the analytical expressions for various asymmetric and angular observables in the Standard Model and the new physics scenarios and compared them with the literature. Using the available inputs from the lattice, we have predicted the values with uncertainties of all these observables in the Standard Model. Considering the new physics effects in $b\to c\tau^-\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ transitions, we have constrained the new Wilson coefficients of the one operator and two operator scenarios from the available data on these decays. The two-operator scenario with scalar-pseudoscalar and tensor quark current provides the most plausible solution to the current data. Also, we have tested the new physics sensitivities (one or two-operator scenarios) of the different angular observables in $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c (\to \Lambda \pi^{+}) \tau^- \bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decays and found correlations among them. We have noted a few one or two-operator scenarios to which some of these observables are sensitive. By measuring these observables, it will be possible to distinguish these effects from one another.</description>

      <title>Atomic binding corrections for high energy fixed target experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High energy beams incident on a fixed target may scatter against atomic electrons. To a first approximation, one can treat these electrons as at rest. For precision experiments, however, it is important to be able to estimate the size of, and when necessary calculate, sub-leading corrections. We discuss atomic binding corrections to relativistic lepton-electron scattering. We analyze hydrogen in detail, before generalizing our analysis to multi-electron atoms. Using the virial theorem, and many-body sum rules, we find that the corrections can be reduced to measured binding energies, and the expectation value of a single one-body operator. We comment on the phenomenological impact for neutrino flux normalization and an extraction of hadronic vacuum polarization from elastic muon electron scattering at MUonE.</description>

      <title>QCD effects in electroweak $WZjj$ production at current and future hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new features for the implementation of $WZjj$ production via vector-boson scattering in the framework of the POWHEG BOX program. In particular, previously unavailable semi-leptonic and fully hadronic decay modes of the intermediate vector bosons are provided, and operators of dimension six in an effective-field theory approach to account for physics beyond the Standard Model in the electroweak sector are included. For selected applications phenomenological results are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the new program. The impact of the considered dimension-six operators on experimentally accessible distributions is found to be small for current LHC energies, but enhanced in the kinematic reach of a potential future hadron collider with an energy of 100 TeV. The relevance of fully accounting for spin correlations and off-shell effects in the decay system is explored by a comparison with results obtained with the MadSpin tool that are based on an approximate treatment of the leptonic final state resulting from vector boson scattering processes. For selected semi-leptonic and hadronic decay modes we demonstrate the sensitivity of realistic signal selection procedures on QCD corrections and parton-shower effects.</description>

      <title>A new method to search for highly ionizing exotic particles, monopoles and beyond, using time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the energy loss and mass of highly ionizing particles predicted by theories from beyond the Standard Model pose considerable challenges to conventional detection techniques. Such particles are predicted to experience energy loss to matter they pass through that exceeds the dynamic range specified for most readout chips, leading to saturation of the detectors' electronics. Consequently, achieving precise energy loss and mass measurements becomes unattainable. We present a new approach to detect such highly ionizing particles using time projection chambers that overcomes this limitation and provide a case study for triggering on magnetic monopoles.</description>

      <title>Development of low-radon ultra-pure water for the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory(JUNO) is a state-of-the-art liquid scintillator-based neutrino physics experiment under construction in South China. To reduce the background from external radioactivities, a water Cherenkov detector composed of 35~kton ultra-pure water and 2,400 20-inch photomultiplier tubes is developed. Even after specialized treatment, ultra-pure water still contains trace levels of radioactive elements that can contribute to the detector background. Among which $^{222}$Rn is particularly significant. To address this, an online radon removal system based on the JUNO prototype has been developed. By integrating micro-bubble generators to enhance degasser's radon removal efficiency, the radon concentration in water can be reduced to 1~mBq/m$^{3}$ level, meeting the stringent requirements of JUNO. Additionally, a highly sensitive online radon concentration measurement system capable of detecting concentrations $\sim$1~mBq/m$^3$ has been developed to monitor the radon concentration in water. In this paper, the details regarding both systems will be presented.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of heavy hybrid quarkonia and $\overline{b}gc$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masses and current couplings of the charmonium and bottomonium hybrids $ \overline{c}gc$ and $\overline{b}gb$ with spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{PC} }=0^{++},\ 0^{+-},\ 0^{-+},\ 0^{--}$ and $1^{++},\ 1^{+-},\ 1^{-+},\ 1^{--}$ are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. Computations are performed by taking into account gluon condensates up to dimension 12 including terms $\sim \langle g_{s}^{3}G^{3}\rangle ^{2}$. The parameters of the bottom-charm hybrids $\overline{b}gc$ with quantum numbers $J^{\mathrm{PC }}=0^{+},\ 0^{-},\ 1^{+}$, and $1^{-}$ are calculated as well. In computations the dominance of the pole contribution to sum rule results is ensured. It is demonstrated that all charmonia hybrids decay strongly to two-meson final states. The bottomonium hybrids $0^{-+}$ and $1^{-+}$ as well as the bottom-charm hybrids $0^{-(+)}$ and $1^{-(+)}$ may be stable against strong two-meson decay modes. Results of the present work are compared with ones obtained using the sum rule and alternative approaches. Our predictions for parameters of the heavy hybrid mesons may be useful to study their various decay channels which are important for interpretation of ongoing and future experiments.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ production within a jet in high-energy proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of leading power factorization formalism of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics, we calculate the jet fragmentation function for $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton (pp) collisions ranging from $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV to $13$ TeV. The reasonable agreements between theory and experimental data indicate that $J/\psi$ production within a jet is mainly dominated by gluon fragmentation. Such a mechanism can be further tested by the predicted jet transverse momentum and radius dependence of jet fragmentation function. Based on the satisfying description of pp baseline, we carry out the first theoretical investigation on medium modification on $J/\psi$ production within jet in heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, using a linear Boltzmann transport model combined with hydrodynamics for the simulation of jet-medium interaction. The consistency with the experimental measurement on nuclear modification factor $R_{\text{AA}}$ by CMS collaboration reveals that the gluon jet quenching is the driving force for the suppression of $J/\psi$ production in jet. Furthermore, we make predictions for the dependence of $R_{\text{AA}}$ on the jet transverse momentum and jet radius $R$, which can be tested in future measurements to further constrain the flavor dependence of jet quenching.</description>

      <title>Extraction of trans-helicity worm-gear distributions and opportunities at the Electron-Ion Collider in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a global analysis of the trans-helicity worm-gear distribution function, $g_{1T}^\perp$, by fitting the longitudinal-transverse double spin asymmetry data of the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. The analysis is performed within the framework of transverse momentum dependent factorization and evolution. It is found that the $u$-quark favors a positive distribution and the $d$-quark favors a negative distribution, which is consistent with previous model calculations and phenomenological extractions. Based on the fit to existing world data, we also study the impact of the proposed electron-ion collider in China and conclude that it can significantly improve the precision of the worm-gear distribution function and hence enhance our understanding of nucleon spin structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is reported for near-threshold structures in the J/$\psi$J/$\psi$ invariant mass spectrum produced in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV from data collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 135 fb$^{-1}$. Three structures are found, and a model with quantum interference among these structures provides a good description of the data. A new structure is observed with a significance above 5 standard deviations at a mass of 6638 $^{+43}_{-38}$ (stat) $^{+16}_{-31}$ (syst) MeV. Another structure with even higher significance is found at a mass of 6847 $^{+44}_{-28}$ (stat) $^{+48}_{-20}$ (syst) MeV, which is consistent with the X(6900) resonance reported by the LHCb experiment and confirmed by the ATLAS experiment. Evidence for another new structure, with a local significance of 4.7 standard deviations, is found at a mass of 7134 $^{+48}_{-25}$ (stat) $^{+41}_{-15}$ (syst) MeV. Results are also reported for a model without interference, which does not fit the data as well and shows mass shifts up to 150 MeV relative to the model with interference.</description>

      <title>Determination of impact parameter for CEE with digi-input neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact parameter characterizes the centrality in nucleus-nucleus collision geometry. The determination of impact parameters in real experiments is usually based on the reconstructed tracks and hits, or the derived event-level observables. For the scheduled Cooler-storage-ring External-target Experiment (CEE), the low beam energy results in a reduction of dependency between the impact parameter and charged particle multiplicity, which decreases the validity of the explicit determination methods. This work implements a few neural networks that directly take the digitized signals from the external Time-of-flight detectors as input. The model with the best performance has shown a mean absolute error of 0.479 fm with the simulated U-U collisions at 0.5 AGeV. Performances of these models with digi inputs are compared with reference models with phase space inputs, showing the capacity of neural networks in handling the original but potentially interrelated digitized signal information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for a heavy CP-odd Higgs boson, $A$, decaying into a $Z$ boson and a heavy CP-even Higgs boson, $H$, is presented. It uses the full LHC Run 2 dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $140$ fb$^{-1}$. The search for $A\to ZH$ is performed in the $\ell^+\ell^- t\bar{t}$ and $\nu\bar{\nu}b\bar{b}$ final states and surpasses the reach of previous searches in different final states in the region with $m_H&gt;350$ GeV and $m_A&gt;800$ GeV. No significant deviation from the Standard Model expectation is found. Upper limits are placed on the production cross-section times the decay branching ratios. Limits with less model dependence are also presented as functions of the reconstructed $m(t\bar{t})$ and $m(b\bar{b})$ distributions in the $\ell^+\ell^- t\bar{t}$ and $\nu\bar{\nu}b\bar{b}$ channels, respectively. In addition, the results are interpreted in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models.</description>

      <title>Decays of $1^{-+}$ Charmoniumlike Hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By extracting the transition amplitudes, we give the first lattice QCD prediction of the two-body decay partial widths of the $1^{-+}$ charmoniumlike hybrid $\eta_{c1}$. Given the calculated mass value $m_{\eta_{c1}}=4.329(36)$ GeV, the $\eta_{c1}$ decay is dominated by the open charm modes $D_1\bar{D}$, $D^*\bar{D}$ and $D^*\bar{D}^*$ with partial widths of $258(133)$ MeV, $88(18)$ MeV and $150(118)$ MeV, respectively. The coupling of $\eta_{c1}$ to $\chi_{c1}$ plus a flavor singlet pseudoscalar is not small, but $\chi_{c1}\eta$ decay is suppressed by the small $\eta-\eta'$ mixing angle. The partial width of $\eta_{c1}\to \eta_c\eta'$ is estimated to be around 1 MeV. We suggest experiments to search for $\eta_{c1}$ in the $P$-wave $D^*\bar{D}$ and $D^*\bar{D}^*$ systems. Especially, the polarization of $D^*\bar{D}^*$ can be used to distinguish the $1^{-+}$ product (total spin $S=1$) from $1^{--}$ products ($S=0$).</description>

      <title>Testing Parity Symmetry with the Polarized Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New physics in the early Universe could lead to parity-violation in the late Universe, sourcing statistics whose sign changes under point reflection. The best constraints on such phenomena have come from the Planck temperature fluctuations; however, this is already cosmic-variance-limited down to relatively small scales, thus only small improvements are expected in the future. Here, we search for signatures of parity-violation in the polarized CMB, using the Planck PR4 $T$- and $E$-mode data. We perform both a simulation-based blind test for any parity-violating signal at $\ell&lt;518$, and a targeted search for primordial $U(1)$ gauge fields (and the amplitudes of a generic collapsed model) at $\ell&lt;2000$. In all cases, we find no evidence for new physics, with the model-independent test finding consistency with the FFP10/NPIPE simulation suite at $(-)0.4\sigma$, and the gauge field test constraining the fractional amplitude of gauge fields during inflation to be below $6\times 10^{-19}$ at $95\%$ confidence level for a fiducial model. The addition of polarization data can significantly improve the constraints, depending on the particular model of primordial physics, and the bounds will tighten significantly with the inclusion of smaller-scale information.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping High-Energy Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we set up the numerical S-matrix bootstrap by using the crossing symmetric dispersion relation (CSDR) to write down Roy equations for the partial waves. As a motivation behind examining the local version of the CSDR, we derive a new, crossing symmetric, 3-channels-plus-contact-terms representation of the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude in string theory that converges everywhere except at the poles. We then focus on gapped theories and give novel analytic and semi-analytic derivations of several bounds on low-energy data. We examine the high-energy behaviour of the experimentally measurable rho-parameter, introduced by Khuri and Kinoshita and defined as the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the amplitude in the forward limit. Contrary to expectations, we find numerical evidence that there could be multiple changes in the sign of this ratio before it asymptotes at high energies. We compare our approach with other existing numerical methods and find agreement, with improvement in convergence.</description>

      <title>The Low soft-photon theorem again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that contrary to claims of Ref. [1] the formulated in the proper physical variables Low theorem [2] for soft photon emission does not require any modification. We also reject the criticism in Ref. [1] of the papers [3,4]. At the same time, we identify some inaccuracies in Ref. [3] in the presentation of the soft-photon theorem for the case of spin-one-half particles. We also point out shortcomings in consideration of the Low theorem in the classic textbooks [5,6].</description>

      <title>A Panoramic Study of $K$-Factors for 111 Processes at the 14 TeV LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this comprehensive study, we investigate $K$-factors ($K=\sigma_{\text{NLO}}/\sigma_{\text{LO}}\equiv 1+\delta K$) for a broad array of Standard Model processes at the 14 TeV LHC, which are pivotal for background assessments in Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) searches. Using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, we calculate the leading-order and next-to-leading order (NLO) cross-sections and compute the corresponding $K$-factors for 111 processes. Our analysis reveals $K$-factors ranging from 1.005 for $pp \to jjj$ to 4.221 for $pp\to W^\pm \gamma\gamma\gamma$. Key findings include: (i) processes involving photons display significantly high $K$-factors, attributed to gluon-initiated processes at NLO; (ii) processes with multiple particle productions, particularly those involving vector bosons, exhibit elevated $K$-factors due to multiple real emission processes; (iii) there exists an inverse correlation between the number of jets and $\delta K$, indicating that the addition of jets generally leads to a decrease in $\delta K$. Additionally, our investigation into differential $K$-factors relative to transverse momentum and invariant mass shows notable increases with higher $p_T$, but minimal changes with invariant mass. This study highlights the indispensable role of precise $K$-factor evaluations for accurate interpretations of BSM search outcomes.</description>
