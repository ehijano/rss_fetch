      <title>Classification of obscuration-free reflective polygonal light beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the connected components of an obscuration-free planar polygonal light beam space modeling light propagation in optical systems composed of reflective surfaces and a focal plane. Through homotopy construction, we demonstrate that the connected components of this space are in bijection with the connected components of the reflective polygonal chains space, whose elements are the polygonal chains with their respective mirrors' orientations taken into account. In order to prove this, we introduce a topological invariant that provides an intelligible way for opticians to name homotopy-equivalent obscuration-free optical configurations thanks to previous work with polygonal chains.</description>

      <title>Antibunched emission from femtosecond laser-written nano-ablations on gallium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser-writing offers distinct capabilities for fabrication, including three-dimensional, multi-material, and sub-diffraction-limited patterning. In particular, demonstrations of laser-written quantum emitters and photonic devices with superior optical properties have attracted attention. Recently, gallium nitride (GaN) has been reported to host quantum emitters with narrow and bright zero-phonon photoluminescence from ultraviolet to telecom ranges. However, emitters formed during epitaxy are randomly positioned, and until now, it has not been possible to fabricate quantum emitters in ordered arrays. In this paper, we employ femtosecond laser writing to create nano-ablations with sub-diffraction-limited diameter, and use rapid thermal annealing to activate co-located stable emitters. The emitters show MHz antibunched emission with a sharp spectral peak at room temperature. Our study not only presents an efficient approach to laser-written nanofabrication on GaN but also offers a promising pathway for the deterministic creation of quantum emitters in GaN, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms involved.</description>

      <title>Topological photonics of generalized and nonlinear eigenvalue equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonics is developed based on the analogy of Schr\"{o}dinger equation which is mathematically reduced to a standard eigenvalue equation. Notably, several photonic systems are beyond the standard topological band theory as they are described by generalized or nonlinear eigenvalue equations. In this article, we review the topological band theory of this category. In the first part, we discuss topological photonics of generalized eigenvalue equations where the band structure may take complex values even when the involved matrices are Hermitian. These complex bands explain the characteristic dispersion relation of hyperbolic metamaterials. In addition, our numerical analysis predicts the emergence of symmetry-protected exceptional points in a photonic crystal composed of negative index media. In the second part, by introducing auxiliary bands, we establish the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence under ``weak" nonlinearity of eigenvalues. The nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence elucidates the robustness of chiral edge modes in photonic systems where the permittivity and permeability are frequency dependent.</description>

      <title>Twist Bilayer Photonic slab's Angle-DependentGuided Resonance Analysis based on Multiple Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the transmission spectra of the twisted bilayer photonic slabs using a modified rigorous coupled wave (RCWA) analysis, where the evanescent bases are replaced by bases with non-zero flux density. By utilizing the modified RCWA we demonstrate the calculation of eigenmodes, which has not been realized before. To counter for the transmission property, we propose a five-layer uniform slab approximation, with an accuracy around 0.04a/c, which is more straightforward and accessible for optical engineers compared to work by Lou et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 136101]. The moir\'e pattern perturbation induces a split of resonance, which show great potential for engineering the band structure. Moreover, We observe two distinct transmission phases: the angle-dependent phase and Fabry-P\'erot phase, which is explained by a coupled-mode theory (CMT) with expanded channels brought by the modified eigenmodes. Our work provides a theoretical framework for the design and optimization of twisted bilayer photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Parasitic loss in microring-waveguide coupling and its impact on wideband nonlinear photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microring resonators enable the enhancement of nonlinear frequency mixing processes, generating output fields at frequencies that widely differ from the inputs, in some cases by more than an octave. The efficiency of such devices depends on effective in- and out-coupling between access waveguides and the microrings at these widely separated frequencies. One successful approach is to separate the coupling task across multiple waveguides, with a cutoff waveguide (a waveguide that does not support guided modes above a certain wavelength) being judiciously used to prevent unwanted excessive overcoupling at low frequencies. Here, we examine how such a cutoff waveguide can still induce parasitic loss in the coupling region of a microring resonator, thereby impacting nonlinear device performance. We verified this parasitic loss channel through both experiment and simulation, showing that a waveguide optimized for 532 nm (visible) and 780 nm (near-infrared), while nominally cut off at 1550 nm, can still introduce significant parasitic loss at telecom wavelengths. This is studied in the context of visible-telecom optical parametric oscillation, where the excess parasitic loss can be strong enough to prevent threshold from being reached. Our finding elucidates a major challenge for wideband integrated nonlinear photonics processes when efficient coupling of widely-separated frequencies is needed.</description>

      <title>Optical Kerr soliton microcombs for high bandwidth communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microcombs, optical frequency combs generated by nonlinear integrated micro-cavity resonators, have the potential to offer the full capability of their benchtop comb based counterparts, but in an integrated footprint. They have enabled breakthroughs in spectroscopy, microwave photonics, frequency synthesis, optical ranging, quantum state generation and manipulation, metrology, optical neuromorphic processing and more. One of their most promising applications has been optical fibre communications where they have formed the basis for massively parallel ultrahigh capacity multiplexed data transmission. Innovative approaches have been used in recent years to phaselock, or modelock different types of microcombs, from dissipative Kerr solitons to dark solitons, soliton crystals and others. This has enabled their use as sources for optical communications including advanced coherent modulation format systems that have achieved ultrahigh data capacity bit rates breaking the petabit/s barrier. Here, we review this new and exciting field, chronicling the progress while highlighting the challenges and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Intelligent configuration of integrated microwave photonic filter with programmable response and self-stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated microwave photonic filters (IMPFs) have emerged as promising candidates for advanced microwave systems owing to their distinctive combination of wide operational bandwidth, reconfigurable functionality, and compact size. Nevertheless, the complex and time-consuming manual manipulation of IMPFs remains a significant impediment to their widespread applications. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we experimentally demonstrate the first intelligent configuration of IMPF featuring wideband center frequency tunability, flexible bandwidth reconfigurability, self-stabilization, and excellent channel equalization simultaneously. The configuration strategy is enabled by our proposed universal hybrid collaboration algorithm, which can fully unleash the hardware potential of the optical device, thus enabling comprehensive synergy of multiple properties. Results show that the center frequency of IMPF is tuned from 2 to 48 GHz, and the bandwidth is reconfigured from 0.66 to 4.15 GHz, with a rejection ratio of up to 37.67 dB. The roll-off rate and shape factor reach as high as 17.50 dB/GHz and 0.78, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum center frequency drift of IMPF in 3 hours is reduced from 11.950 to 0.051 GHz even without a thermo-electric cooler, indicating that the center frequency stability is enhanced by 234 times. The passband shape of the IMPF can also be dynamically adjusted to equalize frequency-dependent fading, achieving up to 2.42 dB compensation of intra-channel fading. Our work highlights the potential of IMPFs based on intelligent configuration, unlocking new avenues for practical applications of microwave photonic signal processing.</description>

      <title>A label-free sub-diffractive technique for 3D intracellular tomography using thermally induced convection currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally, 3-dimensional cellular tomography can be done with light sheet or multi-angle observations. Recently, a new technique was introduced where the cell was rotated using convection currents to visualize the outer periphery (Liu et al., Nano Lett., 2023, 23, 5148). However, the work falls short of actually observing intracellular objects like organelles etc. In this manuscript, we modify the technique by relying on computer vision algorithm called Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation (CLAHE) to improve the contrast for better detection of intra-cellular points, and then use optical flow detection technique to extract the in-plane speed of the point. This then is used to extract the vertical location, knowing that at the bottom part of the sphere, the point would be moving in one direction, close to the center there would be much less motion, while in the top portion of the sphere, the point would be moving in the reverse direction than the bottom. The velocity allows the exact localisation of the point in the vertical direction. This process allows for sub-diffractive intracellular tomography. This technique can further allow high-resolution detection of fluorescent molecules inside the cell also, when combined with convective flows.</description>

      <title>Quantum boomerang effect of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum boomerang effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon where a wave packet, despite having an initial momentum, returns to its starting position in a disordered medium. However, up to now, the experimental exploration of this effect remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the experimental observation of the quantum boomerang effect of light. Our experiment is based on a one-dimensional disordered photonic lattice, which is composed of on-chip optical waveguides with engineered on-site random potential. We first characterize this optical disordered system by demonstrating the static Anderson localization of light beams. Next, through launching a kinetic light beam into the system, we observe that the light beam first moves away from its starting point, arrives at a maximum value, reverses its direction, and returns to its original position over time, confirming the observation of the quantum boomerang effect of light. Surprisingly, we find that optical loss, usually considered to be detrimental to optical experiments, can enhance the quantum boomerang effect by accelerating the light back to its original position. Our work provides new insights into the light-matter interactions in disordered medium and opens an avenue for future study of this phenomenon in nonlinear and many-photon contexts.</description>

      <title>Frequency conversion between optical and microwave photons in non-Markovian environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a scheme for frequency conversion between optical photons and microwave photons in non-Markovian environments using both magnetic and mechanical excitations as intermediate media. When the frequencies of optical photons, magnons, phonons, and microwave photons resonance, the conversion efficiency can be made close to reach 98.76$\%$ by adjusting the defined complex cooperativities, while in the case of Markovian, the conversion efficiency is 90.44$\%$. By controlling the environmental spectral widths, the efficiency of frequency conversion exhibits a transition from Markovian regimes to non-Markovian regimes. This transformation simultaneously improves frequency conversion efficiency and conversion bandwidth, which is due to the excitation backflow generated by the interaction between the system and the non-Markovian environments. In the case, when the optical pump power in the non-Markovian regimes are of a large order of magnitude, the conversion bandwidth can be increased, but at the cost of reduced conversion efficiency. Our scheme improves the frequency conversion efficiency and bandwidth between optical photons and microwave photons, breaking the limitations of frequency conversion in Markovian environments and providing a new approach for long-distance quantum communication research of other non-Markovian quantum systems in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockade via two degenerate optical parametric amplifiers in spinning resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to achieving simultaneous nonreciprocal unconventional photon blockade in a system of two coupled spining resonators marked by modes a and b, each incorporating an degenerate optical parametric amplifier (DOPA). By rotating the resonators, input light from opposite directions induces opposite Sagnac-Fizeau shifts. These shifts result in the emergence or absence of quantum destructive interference in two-photon excitation processes. Specifically, when destructive quantum interference occurs, photons from one input direction are simultaneously blocked in both resonators, whereas the absence of complete destructive quantum interference causes the blockade effect to vanish for inputs from the opposite direction. We analytically give the optimal parameter conditions to achieve simultaneous strong photon blockade with the parametric amplification. By adjusting the Sagnac-Fizeau shifts, we can make mode a nonreciprocal photon blockade, while mode b exhibits photon blockade in both directions. This work lays a theoretical foundation for the development of multimode simultaneous nonreciprocal unconventional single-photon devices, which hold promising potential in multichannel topological optics and chiral quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics with a driven three-level giant atom in a semi-infinite photonic waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Markovian effects of open quantum systems subjected to external environments are deemed to be valuable resources in quantum optics and quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of a three-level giant atom coupling with a semi-infinite photonic waveguide through multiple coupling points and driven by a classical driving field. We derive the analytical expressions for the probability amplitudes of the driven three-level giant atom and obtain two independent conditions. We find two different types of bound states (including the static bound states and the periodic equal-amplitude oscillating bound states) and discuss the physical origins of the bound states formation. Moreover, we discuss the case of the driven three-level giant atom interacting with the infinite photonic waveguide, where there is only one purely imaginary solution (i.e., only one bound state condition exists) for its complex frequency (coming from the absence of mirror at one end of the waveguide) compared to that of a driven three-level giant atom coupling with a semi-infinite photonic waveguide. With this, we also find two different types of bound states, including the static bound state and the periodic equal-amplitude oscillating bound states. Finally, the above results are generalized to a more general model involving a semi-infinite photonic waveguide coupling with an arbitrary number of noninteracting three-level giant atoms driven by the driving fields. The proposed protocol could provide a pathway to precisely elucidate the non-Markovian dynamics of driven, multi-level giant atoms coupled to semi-infinite or infinite photonic waveguides.</description>

      <title>Backflow in vector Gaussian beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Poynting backflow in a single vector Gaussian beam is examined. The paraxial Maxwell equations and their exact solutions containing terms proportional to the small parameter $\varepsilon=\frac{\lambda}{2\pi w_0}$, or to its square, where $w_0$ is the beam waist, are made use of. Explicit analytical calculations show that just these additional expressions are responsible for the occurrence of the reversed Poynting-vector longitudinal component for selected polarizations. Concrete results for the time-averaged vector for several Gaussian beams with $n=1$ ($n$ being the topological index of the beam) are presented. Depending on the choice of polarization, the backflow area is located around the beam's axis, has an annular character or is absent. In the case of $n=2$, backflow areas were found as well. The magnitude of the backflow proved to be proportional to $\varepsilon^4$.</description>

Abstract: Topological photonic crystals (PhCs) offer robust, disorder-resistant modes engendered by nontrivial band symmetries, but designing PhCs with prescribed topological band properties remains a challenge due to the complexity involved in mapping the continuous real-space design landscape of photonic crystals to the discrete output space of band topology. Here, we introduce a new approach to address this problem, employing Kolmogorov--Arnold networks (KANs) to predict and inversely design the band symmetries of two-dimensional PhCs with two-fold rotational (C2) symmetry. We show that a single-hidden-layer KAN, trained on a dataset of C2-symmetric unit cells, achieves 99% accuracy in classifying the symmetry eigenvalues of the lowest transverse-magnetic band. For interpretability, we use symbolic regression to extract eight algebraic formulas that characterize the band symmetry classes in terms of the Fourier components of the dielectric function. These formulas not only retain the full predictive power of the network but also enable deterministic inverse design. Applying them, we generate 2,000 photonic crystals with target band symmetries, achieving over 92% accuracy even for high-contrast, experimentally realizable structures beyond the training domain.</description>

      <title>Optical Spintronics: Towards Lorentz-Reciprocal Nonreciprocal Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy, momentum, and angular momentum are fundamental properties tied to the symmetries of space and time, with photons and other elementary particles acting as carriers of these quantities. In most optical and optoelectronic devices, energy transfer is crucial, but it often results in undesirable energy absorption. Moreover, non-reciprocal elements such as optical diodes and circulators are difficult to implement in photonics, as they typically require time-dependent perturbations, nonlinear effects, or external magnetic fields. This presents a significant barrier to the development of efficient, compact photonic technologies. We introduce the concept of optical spin current, wherein spin angular momentum is transferred by an electromagnetic field without accompanying energy transfer. This phenomenon is analogous to electron spin currents, where spin is decoupled from charge flow. Building on this principle, we propose optical spin diode and circulator -- devices that enable unidirectional propagation of spin currents while maintaining bidirectional energy flow, thus preserving reciprocity. Furthermore, we demonstrate asymmetric spin transfer between quantum dots mediated by the optical spin diode, highlighting the potential for novel optical spintronic functionalities. These findings lay the foundation for devices that leverage optical spin transfer, opening new avenues for advancements in optical spintronics.</description>

      <title>Automated grading and staging of ovarian cancer using deep learning on the transmission optical microscopy bright-field images of thin biopsy tissue samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ovarian cancer remains a challenging malignancy to diagnose and manage, with prognosis heavily dependent on the stage at detection. Accurate grading and staging, primarily based on histopathological examination of biopsy tissue samples, are crucial for treatment planning and predicting outcomes. However, this manual process is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability among pathologists. The increasing volume of digital histopathology slides necessitates the development of robust, automated methods to assist in this critical diagnostic step for ovarian cancer. (Methods) This study presents a deep learning framework for the automated prediction of ovarian cancer stage (classified into five categories: 0, I, II, III, IV) using routine histopathological images. We employed a transfer learning approach, fine-tuning a ResNet-101 convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. The training process incorporated comprehensive data augmentation, weighted random sampling, and class weighting to address dataset characteristics. Hyperparameter optimization for learning rate, dropout rate, and weight decay was performed using a genetic algorithm to enhance model performance and generalization. (Results) Evaluated on an independent test set of ovarian thin tissue brightfield images, the developed model achieved a high overall classification accuracy of 97.62%.</description>

      <title>QR$^2$-code: An open-source program for double resonance Raman spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source program, QR$^2$-code, that computes double-resonance Raman (DRR) spectra using first-principles calculations. QR$^2$-code can calculate not only two-phonon DRR spectra but also single-resonance Raman spectra and defect-induced DRR spectra. For defect-induced DDR spectra, we simply assume that the electron-defect matrix element of elastic scattering is a constant. Hands-on tutorials for graphene are given to show how to run QR$^2$-code for single-resonance, double-resonance, and defect-induced Raman spectra. We also compare the single-resonance Raman spectra by QR$^2$-code with that by QERaman code. In QR$^2$-code, the energy dispersions of electron and phonon are taken from Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) code, and the electron-phonon matrix element is obtained from the electron-phonon Wannier (EPW) code. All codes, examples, and scripts are available on the GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Electron-Electron Interactions: Renormalizing Dirac States in Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding materials in optical cavities has emerged as a strategy for tuning material properties. Accurate simulations of electrons in materials interacting with quantum photon fluctuations of a cavity are crucial for understanding and predicting cavity-induced phenomena. In this article, we develop a non-perturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free self-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between electrons and cavity photons in crystalline materials. We apply this theoretical approach to investigate graphene coupled to the vacuum field fluctuations of cavity photon modes with different types of polarizations. The cavity photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, originating from the quantum nature of light, that lead to significant renormalization of the Dirac bands. In contrast to the case of graphene coupled to a classical circularly polarized light field, where a topological Dirac gap emerges, the nonlocal interactions induced by a quantum linearly polarized photon mode give rise to the formation of flat bands and the opening of a topologically trivial Dirac gap. When two symmetric cavity photon modes are introduced, Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the relevant role of nonlocal interactions. These effects disappear in the classical limit for coherent photon modes. This new self-consistent theoretical framework paves the way for the simulation of non-perturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems, and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of novel cavity-induced quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Chiral near-field control of quantum light generation using magneto-optical graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore strategies to actively control photon emission from quantum light sources by leveraging the large magneto-optical response of graphene. The quantum electrodynamic response of graphene -- characterized by the Purcell factor and the Lamb shift of a proximal emitter -- is analyzed for extended two-dimensional sheets, one-dimensional nanoribbons, and zero-dimensional nanodisks, all of which are endowed with an intrinsic chiral near-field response under a static perpendicular magnetic field. Using rigorous semianalytical models of these systems, we reveal that the emission properties can be readily tuned by variations in doping charge carrier density and applied magnetic field strength, both with respect to magnetoplasmon resonances (at infrared frequencies) and Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations (entering telecommunication bands) associated with optical transitions between discrete Landau levels. Localized magnetoplasmons in graphene nanoribbons are predicted to induce large dissymmetry in the spontaneous emission from left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized transitions in a proximal quantum emitter, presenting applications for chiral quantum optical waveguiding. This chiral dissymmetry is further enhanced in gyrotropic graphene nanodisks, signaling that the spatial shaping of near-fields in nanostructured graphene can significantly boost the intrinsic chiral response induced by the magnetic field. These results indicate that magneto-optical graphene constitutes a versatile and highly tunable platform for quantum light generation and manipulation at the nanoscale.</description>

Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion serves a key role in the realization of hybrid quantum networks by interfacing between wavelength-incompatible platforms. Here we present the first quantum frequency converter connecting visible and telecom domains on a silicon nitride (SiN) chip, using Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing to upconvert heralded single photons from 1260 to 698 nm, which covers a 192 THz span. We examine the noise sources in SiN and devise approaches to suppress noise photons at the source and target frequencies to enable measurements at the single-photon level. We demonstrate an on-chip conversion efficiency of 5% in photon flux and describe design modifications that can be implemented to significantly improve it. Our results pave the way for the implementation of CMOS-compatible devices in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Hopf Bifurcation of Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, nonreciprocity-induced anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates, represents a hallmark of non-Hermitian topological systems with no analogs in Hermitian systems. Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate these behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our work shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Multi-contrast laser endoscopy for in vivo gastrointestinal imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to improve gastrointestinal imaging.</description>

      <title>Investigations of optical aberration on quantum diamond microscopy toward high spatial resolution and sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum diamond microscopy (QDM), which employs nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles, is a promising approach to quantitatively imaging magnetic fields with both high resolution that approaches the diffraction limit and a wide field of view. The commonly adopted setups of QDM capture the photoluminescence through transparent diamonds, which inevitably entail aberrations -- optical errors that degrade the optical resolution and contrast of the obtainable image. In this study, we delve into the impact of optical aberrations, focusing on their dependence on diamond thickness. We first introduce a rigorous model [Richards et al., Braat et al.] of diffraction that incorporates aberrations, producing the NV center optical image. We confirm that this model accurately reproduces the confocal images of single NV centers obtained at various depths in diamonds. Extending this model to a wide-field microscope, we find that the model also accurately reproduces the USAF 1951 resolution test chart obtained through diamonds of various thicknesses. Based on these investigations, we quantitatively assess the consequent resolution constraints and propose thinning the diamond as a viable solution. We present a robust method to quantitatively ascertain resolution in optical systems influenced by aberrations caused by ray transmission through diamonds. For instance, for a typical microscope with an objective lens of NA = 0.7, the diffraction limit is achievable through diamonds that are 30 {\mu}m thick, and a resolution of 1 {\mu}m is obtained through diamonds that are 100 {\mu}m thick. Those results opens up avenues for enhanced performance in QDM. The Julia package used to calculate the vectorial PSFs is available at VectorPSFs.jl.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the significant progress achieved by diffractive optical networks in diverse computing tasks, such as mode multiplexing and demultiplexing, investigations into the physical meanings behind complex diffractive networks at the layer level have been quite limited. Here, for highdimensional vortex mode sorting tasks, we show how various physical transformation rules for each layer within trained diffractive networks can be revealed under properly defined input/output mode relations. An intriguing physical transformation division phenomenon, associated with the saturated sorting performance of the system, has been observed with an increasing number of masks. In addition, we have also demonstrated the use of physical interpretation for efficiently designing parameter-varying networks with high performance. These physically interpretable optical networks resolve the contradiction between rigorous physical theorems and operationally vague network structures, paving the way for designing and understanding systems for various mode conversion tasks, and inspiring further interpretation of diffractive networks in advanced tasks and other network structures.</description>

      <title>Optimal structured light waves generation in 3D volumes using communication mode optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving precise control of light intensity in 3D volumes is highly in demand in many applications in optics. Various wavefront shaping techniques have been utilized to reconstruct a target amplitude profile within a 3D space. However, these techniques are intrinsically limited by cross-talk and often rely on optimization methods to improve the quality of the reconstruction. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a new wavefront shaping method based on interfering the optimum orthogonal communication modes connecting a source plane and a receiving volume. These optimum modes are computed from the singular value decomposition of a coupling operator that connects each point at the source plane to another one in the receiving volume. The modes comprise a pair of source and receiving eigenfunctions, with each forming a complete orthogonal basis for their respective spaces. We utilize these modes to construct arbitrarily chosen 2D and 3D structured light waves within the output receiving volume and optically generate these waves using a spatial light modulator. Our generated intensity profiles exhibit low cross-talk, high fidelity, and high contrast. We envision our work to inspire new directions in any domain that requires controlling light intensity in 3D with high precision and also to serve as a benchmark for other wavefront shaping techniques.</description>

      <title>Efficiency Enhancement of c-Si/TiO$_2$ Heterojunction Thin Film Solar Cell Using Hybrid Metal-Dielectric Nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hybrid metal-dielectric nanostructures (HMDN) are promising candidates to address the ohmic loss by conventional nanostructures in photovoltaic applications by strong confinement and high scattering directivity. In this study, we present a c-Si/TiO$_2$ heterojunction thin film solar cell (TFSC) where a pair of triangular HMDN comprised of Ag and AZO was utilized to enhance the longer wavelength light absorption. The presence of the TiO$_2$ inverted pyramid layer, in combination with the ITO and SiO$_2$-based pyramid layers at the front, enhanced the shorter wavelength light absorption by increasing the optical path and facilitating the coupling of incoming light in photonic mode. Consequently, the average absorption by 1000 nm thick photoactive layer reached 83.32 % for AM 1.5G within the wavelength range of 300 - 1100 nm which was investigated by employing the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The electric field profile and current density profile demonstrated the respective contributions of each layer in the absorption of light at shorter and longer wavelengths. The structure exhibited a short circuit current density ($J_{sc}$) of 37.96 mA/cm$^2$ and a power conversion efficiency ($PCE$) of 17.42 %. The efficiency of our proposed structure experienced a maximum relative change of 0.34 % when a polarized light was exposed with an angle of 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$. The incorporation of self-heating in non-isothermal conditions reduced $PCE$ by $13.77 \%$. In addition, the comparative analysis to assess the impact of HMDN on our structure revealed a $4.54 \%$ increase in $PCE$ of the structure with metallic nanostructures, paving the way for the utilization of HMDN to enhance the performance of TFSC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed numerical study of ultrashort pulse compression using a three-stage hybrid all-bulk multipass cell scheme. By operating in the enhanced frequency chirp regime, we achieve the compression of pulses from around 180 fs to 4 fs pulse duration (a total compression factor above 45), with side lobes contributing with intensity values lower than 0.2 % of the peak intensity. Optimal conditions for the enhanced frequency chirp regime propagation have been identified, enabling smooth spectral broadening and high-quality temporal profiles. The first two stages are based on bulk multipass cells to achieve a controlled spectral broadening, while the third stage consists of a thin plate to reach the spectral broadening needed for few cycle pulses without leaving the enhanced frequency chirp regime.</description>

Abstract: Hermite-Gaussian (HG) beams are standard modes delivered by continuous or pulsed lasers systems, and pulse-front tilt is one of the most common, detrimental or beneficial, spatiotemporal couplings affecting ultrashort pulses. Combining them, we show that focusing a pulsed HG beam with a tilt generates an elliptical spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV), or a chain of them. The elliptical STOVs differ from standard STOVs in an additional spatial chirp that is manifested as a wave front temporal rotation, and results in an enhanced transverse orbital angular momentum. The longitudinal field is significantly larger than that of normal STOVs, and may also take the form of an elliptical STOV. Our concept greatly simplifies previous arrangements for the generation of STOVs, whose additional features make them attractive for improving their applications in electron trapping and acceleration, or as driving fields for the generation of higher-order harmonics and other interactions with matter.</description>

      <title>Production-ready double-side fabrication of dual-band infrared meta-optics using deep-UV lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09488</link>

Abstract: Meta-optics, the application of metasurfaces into optical systems, is seeing an accelerating development owing to advantages in size, weight and cost and the ability to program optical functions beyond traditional refractive optics. The transition of meta-optics from the laboratory into applications is enabled by scalable production methods based on highly reproducible semiconductor process technology. Here, we introduce a novel method for fabrication of double-sided metasurfaces through deep-UV lithography as a production-ready method for achieving high-quality meta-optics. We achieve patterning of a silicon wafer on both sides with mutual alignment of around 25 $\mu$m based on tool accuracy, without requiring through-wafer alignment markers other than the wafer notch. A first novel application highlighting the benefits of double-sided design is demonstrated in the form of a dual-band metalens with independent control over focal lengths in mid- and long-wave infrared bands. Using multi-reticle stitching we demonstrate a 40 mm diameter, large-area metalens with excellent broadband imaging performance, showing partial cancelling of chromatic dispersion when used in a hybrid configuration with a BaF$_2$ refractive lens. Our work opens new avenues for infrared meta-optics designs and double-side meta-optics fabrication through a production-ready technique which can be directly translated into scalable technology for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Single photon emission and single spin coherence of a nitrogen vacancy centre encapsulated in silicon nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.09383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the right material platform for engineering efficient photonic interfaces to solid state emitters has been a long-standing bottleneck for scaling up solid state quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that nitrogen-rich silicon nitride, with its low background auto-fluorescence at visible wavelengths, is a viable quantum photonics platform by showing that nitrogen vacancy centres embedded in nanodiamonds preserve both their quantum optical and spin properties post-encapsulation. Given the variety of high-performance photonic components already demonstrated in silicon nitride, our work opens up a new avenue for building integrated photonic circuits using solid state emitters.</description>

      <title>Coherent heat transfer leads to genuine quantum enhancement in the performances of continuous engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional continuous quantum heat engines with incoherent heat transfer perform poorly as they exploit two-body interactions between the system and hot or cold baths, thus having limited capability to outperform their classical counterparts. We introduce distinct continuous quantum heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding genuine quantum enhancement in performance. These coherent engines consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. We demonstrate that coherent engines deliver significantly higher power output with much greater reliability, i.e., lower signal-to-noise ratio of the power, by hundreds of folds over their incoherent counterparts. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to or at the maximal achievable reliability allowed by the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Moreover, coherent engines manifest more nonclassical features than incoherent engines because they violate the classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a wider range of parameters. These genuine enhancements in the performance of coherent engines are directly attributed to their capacity to harness higher energetic coherence for the resonant driving case. The experimental feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum properties can enhance performance may find applications in quantum-enabled technologies.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of tilt sensing using a homodyne quadrature interferometric translational sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observation in space will demand improvement in the sensitivity of the local sensor for the drag-free control. This paper presents the proposal, design, and demonstration of a new laser interferometric sensor named Quadrature Interferometric Metrology of Translation and Tilt (QUIMETT) for the drag-free local sensor. QUIMETT enables simultaneous measurements of both translational displacement and tilts of a reflective object with a single interferometer package. QUIMETT offers a characteristic feature where the sensitivity to tilt is independent of the interference condition while maintaining the ability to measure the translational displacement for a range greater than the laser wavelength. The tilt-sensing function has been demonstrated in a prototype experiment. The tilt sensitivity remained unchanged in different interference conditions and stayed at 10 nrad/Hz$^{1/2}$ at 0.1 Hz.</description>

      <title>Fast and Automated Optical Polarization Compensation of Fiber Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarization of light is critical in various applications, including quantum communication, where the photon polarization encoding a qubit can undergo uncontrolled changes when transmitted through optical fibers. Bends in the fiber, internal and external stresses, and environmental factors cause these polarization changes, which lead to errors and therein limit the range of quantum communication. To prevent this, we present a fast and automated method for polarization compensation using liquid crystals. This approach combines polarimetry based on a rotating quarter-waveplate with high-speed control of the liquid-crystal cell, offering high-fidelity compensation suitable for diverse applications. Our method directly solves for compensation parameters, avoiding reliance on stochastic approaches or cryptographic metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves over 99% fidelity within an average of fewer than six iterations, with further fine-tuning to reach above 99.5% fidelity, providing a robust solution for maintaining precise polarization states in optical systems.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond and attosecond phase-space correlations in few-particle photoelectron pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal correlations in pulsed electron beams reflect the microscopic dynamics of emission and interparticle interaction. In femtosecond electron emission from nanoscale field emitters, Coulomb interactions result in structured few-electron states with strong correlations in energy, time, and transverse momentum. Interactions with external fields may be used to both probe and further manipulate these correlated states. Here, we combine femtosecond-gated, event-based detection with inelastic electron-light scattering to directly map the photoelectron phase-space distribution of two-electron states. Our experiments demonstrate a bimodal structure in longitudinal phase space, with distinct contributions from interparticle interaction and dispersion. Moreover, we theoretically reveal that global phase modulation coherently shapes the few-electron phase-space distribution to exhibit attosecond temporal correlations. This controlled phasing of few-electron states can be harnessed to produce tailored excitations and super-radiance via two-electron energy post-selection.</description>

      <title>Coherent nonlinear optical probe for cavity-dressed vibrational mode mixing: multidimensional double-quantum coherence and photon-echo signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity modulation of interacting molecular vibrational modes promises an expanded role of the characteristic vibrations to act as spectroscopic markers. In addition to the intrinsic, inter-mode and extrinsic, cavity-mediated inter-mode delocalization, the vibrational modes undergo multiscale relaxation due to reservoir vibrations. Two complementary coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques are presented, which reveal the dynamical nature of the mode correlations in the presence relaxation. Simulations are presented for finite laser pulses. The chosen cavity-vibron mode coupling strengths fall within the range of inter-vibrational mode coupling, hinting at a parameter regime where vibrational energy dispersal can be controlled. It is highlighted that the cavity manipulation of vibrational double excitations, namely, overtone and combination states, can offer deeper insights into the collective mode dynamics. These observations set the ground for cavity-controlled spectroscopic investigation of mode-selective dynamics, where localized electromagnetic modes function as an effective few-body coupler of vibrations.</description>
