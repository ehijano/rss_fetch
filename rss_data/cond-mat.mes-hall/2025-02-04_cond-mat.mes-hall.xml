      <title>Disordered Weyl semimetal as an array of coupled Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a disordered magnetic Weyl semimetal may be mapped onto a two-dimensional array of coupled replicated Hubbard chains, where the Hubbard $U$ is directly related to the variance of the disorder potential. This is a three-dimensional generalization of a similar mapping of the two-dimensional quantum Hall plateau transition to a one-dimensional Hubbard chain. We demonstrate that this mapping leads to the conclusion that the Weyl semimetal becomes a diffusive metal with a nonzero density of states at arbitrarily weak disorder, in agreement with recent work. We also discuss the absence of localization in strongly disordered Weyl semimetals from the viewpoint of this mapping.</description>

      <title>Single electron interference and capacitive edge mode coupling generates $\Phi_0/2$ flux periodicity in Fabry-Perot interferometers in the integer quantum Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Fabry-Perot interferometers operated in the quantum Hall regime facilitate study of coherent charge transport and interactions between localized charges and propagating edge modes. Experimental observations of flux periodicity $\phi_{0}/2$, where $\phi_0=h/e$ is the magnetic flux quantum, for interference of the outermost edge mode in the integer quantum Hall regime have been attributed to an exotic electron pairing mechanism. We present measurements of an AlGaAs/GaAs Fabry-Perot interferometer operated in the integer quantum Hall regime for filling factors $1\leq \nu \leq 3$ that has been designed to simultaneously express measurable bulk-edge and edge-edge couplings. At integer fillings $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$, we observe interference with flux periodicity $\phi_{0}/2$ for the outermost edge mode. However, our analysis indicates that the periodicity $\phi_0/2$ is not driven by electron pairing, but rather is the result of capacitive coupling between multiple isolated edge modes and the outer edge. In our experiment, the interfering unit of charge for the outermost edge mode at $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ was determined to be $e^*=1$, where the effective charge $e^*$ is normalized to the charge of a single electron. Our measurements demonstrate that the magnitude of the interfering charge can be determined in operando in a Fabry-Perot interferometer.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Excitation and Spin Pumping of Chirally Coupled Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an integrated semiconductor chip where a single quantum dot (QD) is excited in-plane via a photonic-crystal waveguide through its nearest p-shell optical transition. The chirality of the waveguide mode is exploited to achieve both directional absorption and directional emission, resulting in a substantial enhancement in directional contrast, as measured for the Zeeman components of the waveguide-coupled QD. This remote excitation scheme enables high directionality (greater than or equal to 0.95) across approximately 56% of the waveguide area, with significant overlap with the Purcell-enhanced region, where the electric field intensity profile is near its peak. In contrast, local excitation methods using an out-of-plane excitation beam focused directly over the area of the QD achieve only approximately 25% overlap. This enhancement increases the likelihood of locating Purcell-enhanced QDs in regions that support high directionality, enabling the experimental demonstration of a six-fold enhancement in the decay rate of a QD with greater than 90% directionality. The remote p-shell excitation protocol establishes a new benchmark for waveguide quantum optics in terms of the combination of Purcell enhancement and high directionality, thereby paving the way for on-chip excitation of spin-based solid-state quantum technologies in regimes of high beta-factor.</description>

      <title>Proposal for Spin-Superfluid Quantum Interference Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In easy-plane magnets, the spin-superfluid phase was predicted to facilitate coherent spin transport. So far, experimental evidence remains elusive. In this letter, we propose an indirect way to sense this effect via the spin-superfluid quantum interference device (spin SQUID) -- inspired by its superconducting counterpart (rf SQUID). The spin SQUID is constructed as a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) magnetic ring with a single Josephson weak link, functioning as an isolated device with a microwave response. The spin current is controlled by an in-plane electric field through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This interaction can be interpreted as a gauge field that couples to the spin supercurrent through the Aharonov-Casher effect. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the device, we show that the spin current and the harmonic frequencies of the spin superfluid are periodic with respect to the accumulated Aharonov-Casher phase and are, therefore, sensitive to the radial electric flux through the ring in units of the electric flux quantum, suggesting a potential electric-field sensing functionality. For readout, we propose to apply spectroscopic analysis to detect the frequency of the harmonic modes.</description>

      <title>Orbital torques and orbital pumping in two-dimensional rare-earth dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of spin-orbit torque properties in two-dimensional (2D) materials presents one of the challenges of modern spintronics. In this context, 2D layers involving rare-earth ions $-$ which give rise to robust magnetism, exhibit pronounced orbital polarization of the states, and carry strong spin-orbit interaction $-$ hold particular promise. Here, we investigate ferromagnetic Janus H-phase monolayers of 4$f$-Eu rare-earth dichalcogenides EuSP, EuSSe, and EuSCl using first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that all compounds exhibit significant spin-orbit torques which originate predominantly in the colossal current-induced orbital response on the Eu $f$-electrons. Moreover, we demonstrate that the corresponding orbital torques can be used to drive strong in-plane currents of orbital angular momentum with non-trivial direction of orbital polarization. Our findings promote $f$-orbital-based 2D materials as a promising platform for in-plane orbital pumping and spin-orbit torque applications, and motivate further research on educated design of orbital properties for orbitronics with 2D materials.</description>

      <title>A spatially varying differential equation for multi-patch pandemic propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovery (SIR) model to account for spatial variations in population as well as infection and recovery parameters. The equations are derived by taking the continuum limit of discrete interacting patches, and results in a diffusion equation with some nonlinear terms. The resulting population dynamics can be reinterpreted as a nonlinear heat flow equation where the temperature vector captures both infected and recovered populations across multiple patches.</description>

      <title>Magneto-plasmonic pesponse of nickel nano-rings prepared by electroless method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-plasmonic nanostructures have emerged as promising candidates for advanced sensing applications. However, conventional fabrication methods, such as lithography and sputtering, often involve high costs and complex processes. This study introduces a novel approach for fabricating nickel nano-rings (200-600 nm in diameter) utilizing nanosphere lithography and selective electroless deposition on ITO substrates. The resulting nickel-silver-boron (Ni-Ag-B) nanoarrays exhibit uniform, durable coatings with robust covalent bonds, providing a simpler, more cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. The unique ring-shaped geometry of the nano-rings enhances plasmonic effects by concentrating the electromagnetic field, thus outperforming other nanostructures. Unlike thin films, these nano-rings demonstrate surface plasmon resonance (SPR) within the 470-614 nm range when illuminated at a 45$^{\deg}$ incident angle. Moreover, ellipsometry parameter calculations and Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements revealed narrow Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) peaks at 512 nm and 560 nm, indicating superior sensitivity for detection compared to conventional SPR and ellipsometry-SPR techniques. Finite element simulations using COMSOL provided valuable insight into the influence of magnetic fields on the electromagnetic response of the nano-rings, confirming their potential for optical communication and highly sensitive sensing technologies. This study addresses limitations in existing magneto-plasmonic systems, offering a scalable and innovative solution for the development of next-generation sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Coulomb correlated multi-particle polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic and emission properties of correlated multi-particle states are studied theoretically using ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ and the configuration interaction methods on a well-known and measured GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots as a test system. The convergence of the calculated energies and radiative lifetimes of Coulomb correlated exciton, biexciton, positive and negative trions to experimentally observed values is reached when the electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are neglected. That unexpected and striking result uncovers a rich structure of multi-particle states in the studied system, which is further quantitatively compared to published measurements in the literature, obtaining astonishingly good agreement. It is proposed that in real experiments the neglected electron-electron and hole-hole exchange interactions are emitted as acoustic phonons during the radiative recombination of the ground state of complexes, leading to the observation of polaronic multi-particle states. Analysis of their energy spectra provides a direct and measurable insight into the Coulomb correlation, being interesting both on the fundamental level and as possible experimentally tunable property in a wide variety of solid-state systems, in particular associated with quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in highly c-plane oriented Mn$_{3}$Ge/Si(100) thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Mn$_{3}$Ge with a non-collinear Kagome structures present exciting prospects for exploring Berry curvature driven anomalous Hall effects (AHE). Despite substantial progress in bulk systems, the synthesis of crystalline thin films directly on silicon with a hexagonal phase presents a particular challenge unless a buffer layer is employed. In this study, we report the synthesis of single phase c-plane oriented hexagonal Mn$_{3}$Ge(0001) films on Si(100) using pulsed laser deposition. Under suitable growth conditions, we obtain layer-by-layer films with atomically flat surfaces and interfaces. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy study reveals the detail surface atomic structures, where the surface Mn atoms spontaneously arrange into a Kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy (dI/dV) measurement on the atomically resolved Kagome surface show a minima in local density of states near the Fermi level, likely originated from the Weyl crossings near K points. Despite the nearly vanishing magnetization, magnetotransport measurements in 30 nm $Mn_{3}$Ge(0001) films show anomalous Hall resistivity up to 0.41 ($\mu\Omega\cdot\text{cm}$) at 2 K. Our \textit{ab initio} calculations shed further light on the existence of topological features and the band structures in Mn$_{3+x}$Ge$_{1-x}$ with increasing Mn concentration $x$. The anomalous Hall response at room temperature in crystalline Mn$_{3}$Ge films on Si(100) offer promising potential for the development of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Interplay of correlations and Majorana mode from local solution perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasiparticle spectrum of a hybrid system, comprising a correlated (Anderson-type) quantum dot coupled to a topological superconducting nanowire hosting the Majorana boundarymodes. From the exact solution of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, we uncover a subtle interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the Majorana mode. Our analytical expressions show that the spectral weight of the leaking Majorana mode is sensitive to both the quantum dot energy level and the repulsive potential. We compare our results with estimations by L.S. Ricco et al. Phys. Rev. B 99, 155159 (2019) obtained for the same hybrid structure using the Hubbard-type decoupling scheme, and analytically quantify the spectral weight of the zero-energy (topological) mode coexisting with the finite-energy (trivial) states of the quantum dot. We also show that empirical verification of these spectral weights could be feasible through spin-polarized Andreev spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Electric Drive in Silicon Quantum Dots with Electric Quadrupole Spin Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation with electron spin qubits requires coherent and efficient manipulation of these spins, typically accomplished through the application of alternating magnetic or electric fields for electron spin resonance (ESR). In particular, electrical driving allows us to apply localized fields on the electrons, which benefits scale-up architectures. However, we have found that Electric Dipole Spin Resonance (EDSR) is insufficient for modeling the Rabi behavior in recent experimental studies. Therefore, we propose that the electron spin is being driven by a new method of electric spin qubit control which generalizes the spin dynamics by taking into account a quadrupolar contribution of the quantum dot: electric quadrupole spin resonance (EQSR). In this work, we explore the electric quadrupole driving of a quantum dot in silicon, specifically examining the cases of 5 and 13 electron occupancies.</description>

      <title>Electrically induced bulk and edge excitations in the fractional quantum Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a voltage pulse to electrically excite the incompressible region of a two-dimensional electron liquid in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall state and investigate the collective excitations in both the edge and bulk via photoluminescence spectral energy shifts. Introducing an offset in the voltage pulse significantly enhances the excitation signal. Real-space and time-resolved measurements reveal the dynamics of the bulk excitations, with an estimated group velocity of approximately $3 \times 10^4$ m/s. These bulk excitations align well with the magneto-plasmon model. Our results highlight the topological link between edge and bulk states, providing a novel approach to exploring solid-state analogs of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sound propagation properties resulting from a dynamical axion insulator generated from a Weyl semimetal are explored. Due to the axial electron-phonon coupling, the speed of sound in the material and its attenuation is seen to be modified. At the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) level, it is seen that the axion obstructs a stronger modification of the speed of sound for longitudinal waves propagating parallel to the Axionic Charge Density Wave (ACDW) wavevector but not for transverse waves. On the other hand, the attenuation is modified by effects beyond the RPA, but the axionic contribution is negligible. These effects can be probed in sound propagation experiments without invoking the axial anomaly, which would require an additional electric field. We also discuss the importance of axial electron-phonon interactions with respect to the more conventional vector interactions in these systems.</description>

      <title>Fracture in concrete: X-ray tomography with in-situ testing, digital volume correlation and phase-field modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test and simulate the mesoscopic cracking behavior of specimens made of a standard concrete mixture. To this end, we combine stable wedge-splitting fracture experiments performed during X-ray tomography, their analysis with digital volume correlation providing the full three-dimensional displacement field, and phase-field cohesive fracture modeling. In our computations, we apply the measured boundary conditions and model the actual heterogeneous material structure at the mesoscopic scale. Within the phase-field model, we explicitly distinguish among (thus individually represent) the mesostructural features of distinct material phases with size above a threshold of 1 mm, while we homogenize pores and finer aggregates below this threshold within the cementitious mortar matrix, with material parameters characterized accordingly. We compare experimental and numerical results in terms of both local and global quantities.</description>

      <title>State transitions and hysteresis in a transverse magnetic island chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chain of dipole-coupled elongated magnetic islands whose long axes are oriented perpendicular to the chain is studied for its magnetization properties. With a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the chain, the competition between dipolar energy, shape anisotropy, and field energy leads to three types of uniform states with distinct magnetizations: (1) oblique to the chain, (2) perpendicular to the chain, and (3) zero due to having alternating dipoles. The response of these states to a slowly varying field is analyzed, focusing on their stability limits and related oscillation modes, and the dependencies on the dipolar and anisotropy constants. Based on identifiable transitions among the three states and their instability points, the theoretically predicted zero-temperature magnetization curves show significant dependence on the anisotropy. The model suggests a path for designing advanced materials with desired magnetic properties. Different geometries and magnetic media for the islands are considered.</description>

      <title>Spectra-orthogonal optical anisotropy in wafer-scale molecular crystal monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the spectral and polarization responses of two-dimensional (2D) crystals is vital for developing ultra-thin platforms for compact optoelectronic devices. However, independently tuning optical anisotropy and spectral response remains challenging in conventional semiconductors due to the intertwined nature of their lattice and electronic structures. Here, we report spectra-orthogonal optical anisotropy, where polarization anisotropy is tuned independently of spectral response, in wafer-scale, one-atom-thick 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) monolayers synthesized on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals. Utilizing the concomitant spectral consistency and structural tunability of perylene derivatives, we demonstrate tunable optical polarization anisotropy in 2DMCs with similar spectral profiles, as confirmed by room-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and cross-polarized reflectance microscopy. Additional angle-dependent analysis of the single- and polycrystalline molecular domains reveals an epitaxial relationship between the 2DMC and the TMD. Our results establish a scalable, molecule-based 2D crystalline platform for unique and tunable functionalities unattainable in covalent 2D solids.</description>

      <title>Entropic costs of the quantum-to-classical transition in a microscopic clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically, which we refer to as the quantum-to-classical transition. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.</description>

      <title>Semi-group influence matrices for non-equilibrium quantum impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.</description>

      <title>First-principle study of surface structure estimation in $L1_0$-FePd(001)/graphene heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a theoretical and computational investigation of the atomic-scale structure of the heterointerface formed between the (001) surface of $L1_0$-ordered iron palladium (FePd) alloy and graphene (Gr), namely, $L1_0$-FePd(001)/Gr. Using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the topmost surface layer consisting of Pd (Pd-terminated surface) becomes more energetically stable than Fe, and Pd-terminated surfaces are not conducive to Gr adsorption. On the other hand, under oxygen atmosphere conditions, our calculation suggests the presence of Fe-terminated surfaces with Gr-covered structures reproducing recent experimental observations; besides, the presence of Fe-O bonds by the surface oxidization is also consistent with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings are crucial for understanding the fabrication processes of interfaces in Fe-based $L1_0$ alloy materials.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Two-dimensional Cs2AgInCl6 Nanoplates as Building Blocks for Functional Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breaking crystal symmetry is essential for engineering emissive double perovskite metal halides. The goal is to overcome their inherently indirect and disallowed optical transitions. Here we introduce a synthesis for silver - Cs2AgInCl6 two-dimensional hybrid nanoplate products that break the symmetry in two ways, their shape and their heterointerfaces. A comparative study between Cs2AgInCl6 nanocubes and nanoplates is presented to emphasize the difference in optical properties. A modified colloidal synthesis for Cs2AgInCl6 yields high-quality nanoplates with small lateral dimensions very different from the symmetric cubes. Each nanoplate is decorated with metallic silver nanoparticles, with diameters on the scale of the thickness of the perovskite nanoplate, forming significant heterointerfaces that further break symmetry. The Cs2AgInCl6 two-dimensional nanoplates also demonstrate facile transformation into larger crystalline nanosheets once deposited on substrates. We thus highlight those nanoplates as potential building blocks for assemblies of functional surfaces.</description>

      <title>Effect of 2$^\text{nd}$ harmonic current--phase relation on a behavior of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the behavior of a Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier assuming a current-phase relation with a second--harmonic contribution. We find that varying the weight of harmonic terms in the Josephson current affects the gain profile. The analysis of gain characteristics, phase-space portraits, Poincar\'e sections, and Fourier spectra demonstrates that the nonsinusoidal contribution influences the operating mode and stability of the device. In particular, we identify the optimal weighting of harmonic contributions that maximizes amplification, achieving gains up to $\sim 13\;\text{dB}$ in a device without dispersion engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of photonic circuits will require on-chip, ultrafast, compact, and energy-efficient components in a scalable platform to power technologies like quantum and neuromorphic computing. Here we present a significant advancement in ultrafast electrical control of highly nonlinear hybrid light-matter quasi-particles, called waveguide exciton-dipolaritons, with extremely low power consumption. Our device, that was shown to perform as an optical transistor with an optical switching power as low as $\sim$1 fJ/operation, achieves a GHz-rate electrical modulation with a record-low total energy consumption $\sim$3 fJ/bit and a compact active area of down to 25 $\mu$m$^2$. This work establishes waveguide-dipolariton platforms for scalable, electrically reconfigurable, ultra-low power photonic circuits for both classical and quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Nodal lines in a honeycomb plasmonic crystal with synthetic spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a plasmonic model on a honeycomb lattice of metallic nanodisks that hosts nodal lines protected by local symmetries. Using both continuum and tight-binding models, we show that a combination of a synthetic time-reversal symmetry, inversion symmetry, and particle-hole symmetry enforce the existence of nodal lines enclosing the $\mathrm{K}$ and $\mathrm{K}'$ points. The nodal lines are not directly gapped even when these symmetries are weakly broken. The existence of the nodal lines is verified using full-wave electromagnetic simulations. We also show that the degeneracies at nodal lines can be relieved by introducing a Kekul\'e distortion that acts to mix the nodal lines near the $\mathrm{K},\mathrm{K}'$ points. Our findings open pathways for designing novel plasmonic and photonic devices without reliance on complex symmetry engineering, presenting a convenient platform for studying nodal structures in two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Noise-resilient host for electron qubit operation up to 0.4 K</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine solid-state material platform for hosting single electron qubits. At temperatures of $\sim$10 mK, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have shown exceptionally long coherence times and high single-qubit gate fidelities. Further expanding the capabilities of this platform to multiple qubits in a scalable fashion will require careful understanding and the corresponding optimization of the underlying noise environment. Here, we demonstrate the remarkable robustness enabled by the neon layer in eNe charge qubits against charge and thermal noise by operating them away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimization, the measured charge (voltage) noise spectral density on neon is comparable to the best in conventional gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots. Up to 0.4 K, the qubit coherence time with dynamical decoupling can still reach the relaxation limit of $\sim$1 microsecond. These observations highlight the potential of solid neon to facilitate a quiet charge environment and eNe qubits' potential for higher-temperature operation in a scaled-up system.</description>

      <title>Near-deterministic photon entanglement from a spin qudit in silicon using third quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike other quantum hardware, photonic quantum architectures can produce millions of qubits from a single device. However, controlling photonic qubits remains challenging, even at small scales, due to their weak interactions, making non-deterministic gates in linear optics unavoidable. Nevertheless, a single photon can readily spread over multiple modes and create entanglement within the multiple modes deterministically. Rudolph's concept of third quantization leverages this feature by evolving multiple single-photons into multiple modes, distributing them uniformly and randomly to different parties, and creating multipartite entanglement without interactions between photons or non-deterministic gates. This method requires only classical communication and deterministic entanglement within multi-mode single-photon states and enables universal quantum computing. The multipartite entanglement generated within the third quantization framework is nearly deterministic, where ``deterministic'' is achieved in the asymptotic limit of a large system size. In this work, we propose a near-term experiment using antimony donor in a silicon chip to realize third quantization. Utilizing the eight energy levels of antimony, one can generate two eight-mode single-photon states independently and distribute them to parties. This enables a random multipartite Bell-state experiment, achieving a Bell state with an upper-bound efficiency of 87.5% among 56 random pairs without non-deterministic entangling gates. This approach opens alternative pathways for silicon-based photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Nonvolatile Spin FETs from 2D Metallic Ferromagnetic and Ferroelectric Multiferroic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-electric-controlled nonvolatile spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) based on two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures hold great promise for advanced spintronics applications. However, their performance is hindered by the limited availability of 2D magnetic materials that can switch effectively between metallic and semiconducting states with sizable bandgaps controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Most studies have focused on materials that are naturally semiconducting, achieving a metallic state by modifying the ferroelectric polarization. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach that uses interface effects to convert inherently metallic 2D magnetic materials into half-metals and induce half-semiconducting behavior through changes in ferroelectric polarization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the CrPS3/Sc2CO2 heterostructure demonstrate that the ferroelectric polarization of Sc2CO2 monolayers can adjust the electronic structure of CrPS3, enabling a switch from half-metallic to half-semiconducting states. Building on these insights, we designed a nonvolatile SFET and analyzed its transport properties using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method combined with DFT. Our results show that reversing the ferroelectric polarization achieves an on/off current ratio exceeding 5000000%, and the heterostructure generates nearly 100% spin-polarized current with a current density of up to 6500 {\mu}A/{\mu}m at bias voltage below 0.2 V. These findings highlight a promising pathway for developing high-performance SFETs that surpass existing 2D heterojunction materials.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic and chemical structure of metal/oxide interfaces were studied in cobalt/magnetite, $Fe_3O_4$, and cobalt/hematite, ${\alpha}-Fe_2O_3$, epitaxial heterostructures using the comprehensive selection of microscopic and spectroscopic methods. It was observed that the cobalt nanostructures and ultrathin films were oxidized at both interfaces, with a thicker cobalt oxide layer in the system with hematite. The formation of cobalt oxides was accompanied by the interfacial reduction of iron that modified magnetic properties of the iron oxides layers. In particular, uncompensated magnetic moments appear in antiferromagnetic hematite, and the orbital magnetic moment of Co grown on magnetite is significantly enhanced for thicknesses below 1 nm. Synchrotron magnetic microscopy showed a direct correlation in the domain structures of the cobalt/iron oxides: ferromagnetic coupling between cobalt and magnetite and between cobalt and the magnetically modified layer of hematite.</description>

      <title>Quantum work statistics across a critical point: full crossover from sudden quench to the adiabatic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When an external parameter drives a system across a quantum phase transition at a finite rate, work is performed on the system and entropy is dissipated, due to the creation of excitations via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Although both the adiabatic and sudden-quench limits have been studied in detail, the quantum work statistics along the crossover connecting these limits has largely been an open question. Here we obtain exact scaling functions for the work statistics along the full crossover from adiabatic to sudden-quench limits for critical quantum impurity problems, by combining linear response theory, conformal field theory, and the numerical renormalization group. These predictions can be tested in charge-multichannel Kondo quantum dot devices, where the dissipated work corresponds to the creation of nontrivial excitations such as Majorana fermions or Fibonacci anyons.</description>

Abstract: Currently, aging effects occurring in multilayer systems attract much attention from researchers. In our research we looked at the behavior of multilayer systems that depend on anisotropy, magnetoresistance and susceptibility.All these parameters are interrelated and have varying degrees of influence on the effects of aging. We researched our Co-layers magnetic system from high-temperature and low-temperature initial states, as well as not only in the critical temperature region, but in a wide low-temperature range. The study was carried out with different types of magnetic anisotropy, which made it possible to identify differences in the behavior of the system depending on the type of anisotropy. We found that in systems exhibiting a dimensional transition, aging effects manifest to gain and themselves in a wide low-temperature range, and not only in a narrow near-critical region, which ultimately leads us to a wide range of applications of these materials for practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropy endows topological aspects in optical systems and furnishes a platform to explore non-Hermitian physics, which can be harnessed for the polarization-selective amplification of light. Here, we show a zero-threshold Raman laser can be achieved in an anisotropic optical microcavity via polarization-controlled optical pumping. A loss-gain mechanism between two polarized Stokes modes arises naturally via polarization-dependent stimulated scattering and anisotropic Raman gain of the active layered material inside the microcavity. A Parity-Time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonian has been proposed to explain the emergence of a single polarization mode, essential for achieving a zero-threshold lasing condition. Additionally, intensity correlation measurements of the Stokes modes validate the coherence properties of the emitted light. Our realization of the zero-threshold Raman laser in anisotropic microcavity can open up a new research direction exploring non-Hermitian and topological aspects of light in anisotropic two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Effective time-dependent temperature for fermionic master equations beyond the Markov and the secular approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a fermionic quantum system exchanging particles with an environment at a fixed temperature and study its reduced evolution by means of a Redfield-I equation with time-dependent (non-Markovian) coefficients. We find that the description can be efficiently reduced to a standard-form Redfield-II equation, however, with a time-dependent effective bath temperature obeying a universal law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state, the effective temperature appears to be very high, yet eventually it settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a time-local master equation, offering high accuracy at all times and preserving the crucial properties of the density matrix. It includes non-Markovian relaxation processes beyond the secular approximation and time-averaging methods and can be further applied to various types of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equations. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional metals, such as graphene, have undergone extensive exploration, with graphene exhibiting a metallic response limited to the infrared spectral range. Overcoming the challenge of extending the electron mobility in two-dimensional metals to achieve plasmonic behaviors in the visible range necessitates innovative synthesis procedures. In this study, we showcase the successful realization of the phase of \c{hi}_3 borophene on diverse substrates using aluminum-based chemical vapor deposition. Leveraging first-principle density-functional theory alongside advanced deep-subwavelength cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, we reveal the extreme anisotropic response of this material in the visible range, transitioning from hyperbolic polaritonic to an elliptic wavefront. Our calculations substantiate the experimental findings, positioning borophene as an unprecedented candidate for the in-plane hyperbolic response in the visible range. These results open avenues for pioneering optoelectronic applications in the visible spectrum, particularly through the incorporation of borophene into hybrid metallic-semiconducting heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Detection and Control of Correlated Charge Tunneling in a Quantum Dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the real-time detection and control of correlated charge tunneling in a dynamically driven quantum dot. Specifically, we measure the joint distribution of waiting times between tunneling charges and show that the waiting times for holes may be strongly correlated due to the periodic drive and the Coulomb interactions on the dot, although the electron waiting times are not. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model that allows us to develop a detailed understanding of the correlated tunneling events. We also demonstrate that the degree of correlations can be controlled by the drive. Our experiment paves the way for systematic real-time investigations of correlated electron transport in low-dimensional nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpi\'nski gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpi\'nski gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most superconductors are thermal insulators. A disordered chiral $\textit{p}$-wave superconductor, however, can make a transition to a thermal metal phase. Because heat is then transported by Majorana fermions, this phase is referred to as a Majorana metal. Here we present numerical evidence that the mechanism for the phase transition with increasing electrostatic disorder is the percolation of boundaries separating domains of different Chern number. We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.</description>

      <title>Novel Topology and Manipulation of Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of wave scattering in complex non-Hermitian settings is an exciting subject -- often challenging the creativity of researchers and stimulating the imagination of the public. Successful outcomes include invisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface development, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to engineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is conventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical symmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions in complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric symmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate the spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the creation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies (EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's signifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically affects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains characterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are topologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding number-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where Lorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are destroyed. Ramifications of this understanding is the proposition for a unique input-magnitude and phase-insensitive 50:50 in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) power splitter. Our study establishes an important step towards complete control of scattering processes in complex non-Hermitian settings.</description>

      <title>Analytical modelling for the frequency behavior of two distinct modes in nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nano-constriction spin-Hall nano-oscillators (NC-SHNOs) have garnered considerable interest due to their potential use as efficient and adjustable nano-sized sources of microwave signals, with high-frequency tunability, adaptable design layout, and CMOS compatibility. In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the "linear-like" and "bullet" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the "linear-like mode," emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized "bullet mode," exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials are fueling research in mesoscopic physics and quantum technology. Recently demonstrated smooth $\beta$-Sn superconductor shells, due to the increased induced gap, are expanding the available parameter space to new regimes. Fabricated on quasiballistic InSb nanowires, with careful control over the hybrid interface, Sn shells yield measurable switching currents even when nanowire resistance is of order 10kohm. In this regime Cooper pairs travel through a purely 1D quantum wire for at least part of their trajectory. Here, we focus on the evolution of proximity-induced supercurrent in magnetic field parallel to the nanowire. Long decay up to fields of 1T is observed. At the same time, the decay for higher occupied subbands is notably faster in some devices but not in others. We analyze this using a tight-binding numerical model that includes the Zeeman, orbital and spin-orbit effects. When the first subband is spin polarized, we observe a dramatic suppression of supercurrent, which is also confirmed by the model and suggests an absence of significant triplet supercurrent generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14640v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, the pair density wave state, an exotic superconducting order showing spatially periodic order parameter modulations with the period of several unit cells and translational symmetry breaking, has attracted broad attention. However, the superconducting pair density modulation within a single unit cell (PDM) has never been carefully investigated before. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of PDM in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001). The superconductivity modulations are characterized by the superconducting gap size and the coherence peak sharpness. Further analysis shows that the local maxima and minima in the superconducting gap modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations of the chalcogen atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the chalcogen atoms in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films grown on SrTiO3(001). Our findings provide precise microscopic information on superconductivity within the lattice unit cell and may promote the understanding of unconventional high-Tc superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Dissecting van der Waals interactions with Density Functional Theory -- Wannier-basis approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</description>

Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable nonlocal Josephson effect through magnetic van der Waals bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10317</link>

Abstract: It is well-known that the proximity effect at superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interfaces produces damped oscillatory behavior of the Cooper pair wave function within the ferromagnetic regions, which is analogous to the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity. It is often called the mesoscopic FFLO state and gives rise to $0-\pi$-transitions in S/F/S Josephson junctions. This paper offers an analysis of the proximity effect at interfaces between superconductors and magnetic van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. The specific feature of the proximity effect in the vdW bilayer systems is the presence of non-local Cooper pairs. We predict that the mesoscopic FFLO state formed by such pairs is sensitive to the difference between on-site energies of the monolayers composing the bilayer and, thus, can be controlled by applying a gating potential to one of the monolayers. This opens the possibility of implementing gate-controlled $0-\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions through the magnetic vdW bilayer weak links.</description>

      <title>Objective Moir\'e Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, typically formed by overlaying two layers of two-dimensional materials, exhibit an effective long-range periodicity that depends on the short-range periodicity of each layer and their spatial misalignment. Here, we study moir\'e patterns in objective structures with symmetries different from those in conventional patterns such as twisted bilayer graphene. Specifically, the mathematical descriptions for ring patterns, 2D Bravais lattice patterns, and helical patterns are derived analytically as representative examples of objective moir\'e patterns, using an augmented Fourier approach. Our findings reveal that the objective moir\'e patterns retain the symmetries of their original structures but with different parameters. In addition, we present a non-objective case, conformal moir\'e patterns, to demonstrate the versatility of this approach. We hope this geometric framework will provide insights for solving more complex moir\'e patterns and facilitate the application of moir\'e patterns in X-ray diffractions, wave manipulations, molecular dynamics, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Friction near the Instability Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an analytical framework to understand quantum friction across distinct stability regimes, providing approximate expressions for frictional forces both in the deep stable regime and near the critical threshold of instability. Our primary finding is analytical proof that, near the instability threshold, the quantum friction force diverges logarithmically. This result, verified through numerical simulations, sheds light on the behavior of frictional instabilities as the system approaches criticality.
  Our findings offer new insights into the role of instabilities, critical divergence and temperature in frictional dynamics across quantum and classical regimes.</description>
