      <title>A Possible Problem with the Sunspot Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspots are areas of strong magnetic fields driven by a convective dynamo. Rudolf Wolf devised his Sunspot Number (SN) series to describe its variation with time. Most other solar phenomena vary in concert with SN, in particular the microwave radiation. During the interval 2014-Jul to 2015-Dec, the variation of the SN with the microwave flux (e.g. F10.7) was anomalous, although microwave flux did not exhibit any anomaly with respect to the solar magnetic field measured by the HMI instrument on the SDO spacecraft. This points to a possible problem with the derivation of the SN using the 148,714 reports of sunspot observations received by the World Data Center Solar Influences (SIDC/SILSO at ROB) since 2011 (when the last public raw data was released). The unavailability of the raw data since then, contrary to avowed open data policy of ROB, prevents independent assessment and possible correction of the anomaly. We urge ROB to make the raw data available.</description>

      <title>The Mirya-m1 Cosmic Ray Detector: Features and First Year Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Mirya-m1 Cosmic Ray Detector, the largest and only cosmic ray detector in Turkiye designed for space weather research. Mirya-m1, modeled and built after the Muon Impact Tracer and Observer (MITO) (Ayuso et al. 2021), is located at the Eastern Anatolia Observatory (DAG) site of the Turkiye National Observatories in Erzurum, Turkiye, at an altitude of 3099 meters. This elevation positions Mirya-m1 among the highest-altitude cosmic ray detectors globally. The detector consists of two stacked scintillator counters, each measuring 1x1 meters, separated by a vertical distance of 1.36 meters. Each scintillator is monitored by four H1411 Hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes, enabling precise detection and measurement of light by incident cosmic rays. In this study, we present the data collected throughout 2024, which includes the detection of two Forbush decrease events in March and May 2024. These significant detections demonstrate the capability of Mirya-m1 to contribute valuable data for space weather research, establishing its potential as a critical instrument for cosmic ray studies in the region.</description>

      <title>Architecture of Tianyu Software: Relative Photometry as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tianyu telescope, an one-meter robotic optical survey instrument to be constructed in Lenghu, Qinghai, China, is designed for detecting transiting exoplanets, variable stars and transients. It requires a highly automated, optimally distributed, easily extendable, and highly flexible software to enable the data processing for the raw data at rates exceeding 500MB/s. In this work, we introduce the architecture of the Tianyu pipeline and use relative photometry as a case to demonstrate its high scalability and efficiency. This pipeline is tested on the data collected from Muguang observatory and Xinglong observatory. The pipeline demonstrates high scalability, with most processing stages increasing in throughput as the number of consumers grows. Compared to a single consumer, the median throughput of image calibration, alignment, and flux extraction increases by 41%, 257%, and 107% respectively when using 5 consumers, while image stacking exhibits limited scalability due to I/O constraints. In our tests, the pipeline was able to detect two transiting sources. Besides, the pipeline captures variability in the light curves of nine known and two previously unknown variable sources in the testing data. Meanwhile, the differential photometric precision of the light curves is near the theoretical limitation. These results indicate that this pipeline is suitable for detecting transiting exoplanets and variable stars. This work builds the fundation for further development of Tianyu software.

      <title>The Leinster-Cobbold diversity index as a criterion for sub-clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automatic procedure to perform sub-clustering on large samples is presented. At each iteration, the most diverse cluster is sub-clustered, and the global diversity of the new classification is compared to the previous one. The process stops if no improvement is found. The key to our procedure is the use of a quantitative measure of diversity, called the Leinster-Cobbold index, that takes into account the similarity between clusters. While this procedure has been successfully applied on a large sample of spectra of galaxies, we illustrate its efficiency with two examples in this paper.</description>

      <title>Expanding Ejecta Method: II. Framework for Cosmological Distance Measurements via Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of the expanding ejecta method (EEM) as a cosmological probe, leveraging its ability to measure angular diameter distances to supernovae (SNe) with intensity interferometry. We propose three distinct applications of the EEM: (1) using Type IIP SNe as moderate-distance geometric anchors to calibrate Cepheids, replacing other local distance indicators; (2) directly calibrating Type Ia SNe, bypassing conventional calibration methods; (3) constructing a fully independent Hubble diagram with Type IIP (Type Ia) SNe, entirely decoupled from the traditional distance ladder. Incorporating realistic SN populations, we forecast a Hubble constant precision with next-generation intensity interferometers of $1.6\%$, $1.1\%$, and $9.3\% \,(3.6\%)$, respectively, for the three different proposed applications. Future intensity interferometry could yield improvements to $1.2\%$, $0.6\%$, and $1.5\%\,(0.4\%)$. The EEM thus offers a powerful geometric alternative for cosmic distance determination.</description>

      <title>NeurIPS 2024 Ariel Data Challenge: Characterisation of Exoplanetary Atmospheres Using a Data-Centric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres through spectral analysis is a complex challenge. The NeurIPS 2024 Ariel Data Challenge, in collaboration with the European Space Agency's (ESA) Ariel mission, provided an opportunity to explore machine learning techniques for extracting atmospheric compositions from simulated spectral data. In this work, we focus on a data-centric business approach, prioritizing generalization over competition-specific optimization. We briefly outline multiple experimental axes, including feature extraction, signal transformation, and heteroskedastic uncertainty modeling. Our experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation plays a crucial role in the Gaussian Log-Likelihood (GLL) score, impacting performance by several percentage points. Despite improving the GLL score by 11%, our results highlight the inherent limitations of tabular modeling and feature engineering for this task, as well as the constraints of a business-driven approach within a Kaggle-style competition framework. Our findings emphasize the trade-offs between model simplicity, interpretability, and generalization in astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Black hole mimickers: from theory to observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole paradigm, while remarkably successful, raises fundamental questions-both classical and quantum-about the nature of spacetime, horizons, and singularities. Black hole mimickers, horizonless ultra-compact objects, have emerged as potential alternatives that seek to resolve some of these puzzles while remaining consistent with current observational constraints. Recent breakthroughs in gravitational-wave astronomy and horizon-scale electromagnetic imaging have opened new avenues to test this paradigm-making this an opportune moment to systematically investigate such alternatives.
  This vision document presents a snapshot of the field as discussed at the Black Hole Mimickers: From Theory to Observation workshop, where experts from gravitational wave astronomy, very long baseline interferometry, numerical and mathematical relativity, and high-energy physics converged to assess the current frontiers. By highlighting key open questions and proposing concrete pathways forward, this document aims to guide future efforts to probe the nature of compact objects. As the field stands at the crossroads of theoretical innovation and observational breakthroughs, we outline strategies to harness upcoming observational capabilities to fundamentally test the black hole paradigm.</description>

      <title>Limits on the 21 cm power spectrum at z=6.5-7.0 from MWA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the spherically-averaged 21 cm power spectrum derived from Epoch of Reionization (EoR) observations conducted with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The analysis uses EoR0-field data, centered at (RA$=0h$, DEC$=-27^{\circ}$), collected between 2013 and 2023. Building on the improved methodology described in Trott et al. 2020, we incorporate additional data quality control techniques introduced in Nunhokee et al. 2024. We report the lowest power level limits on the EoR power spectrum at redshifts $z=6.5$, $z=6.8$, and $z=7.0$. These power levels, measured in the East-West polarization, are $(30.2)^2$ mK$^2$ at $k=0.18\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $(31.2)^2$ mK$^2$ at $k=0.18\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $(39.1)^2$ mK$^2$ at $k=0.21\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ respectively. The total integration time amounts to 268 hours. These results represent the deepest upper limits achieved by the MWA to date and provide the first evidence of heated intergalactic medium (IGM) at redshifts $z=6.5$ to $7.0$.</description>

      <title>The VIIRS-DNB radiance product is insufficient to assess the effect of "cool pavement" materials on nighttime radiances of treated areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In warmer climates, cities face the prospect of higher air temperatures in summer compared to historical averages due to the urban heat island effect. An approach intended to address this problem is the application of "cool pavement" treatments (CPT) to city streets to make them more reflective to sunlight. Raising the albedo of roadways for this purpose may also have the effect of increasing the amount of street light that is reflected into the night sky. The simplest hypothesis explaining the relationship between CPT application and upward radiance is that CPT applied to road surfaces in areas where street lighting is dominant should increase the upward radiance of neighborhoods where the treatments are applied. A simple model predicted radiance increases of 2-6% immediately after CPT application. To test the hypothesis and model predictions, we looked for radiance changes coinciding with the application of CPT in residential neighborhoods of Phoenix, U.S., since 2020. We obtained time series radiance measurements from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day-Night Band (VIIRS-DNB) data from Radiance Light Trends for Phoenix neighborhoods receiving CPT and nearby "control" neighborhoods not receiving CPT. At the 95% confidence level, we found that any increases in nighttime radiances from treated neighborhoods did not exceed about 14%. As a consequence, we cannot rule out either the expected radiance increases from our model or the possibility that CPT application yielded no change in radiance. We therefore cannot draw robust conclusions about the potential influence of CPT deployment on skyglow given the limitations of the DNB as a data source.</description>

      <title>Fully analytical propagator for lunar satellite orbits in closed form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical propagator for the orbits of lunar artificial satellites in a lunar gravity and third-body model sufficiently precise for a wide range of practical applications. The gravity model includes the twelve most important lunar gravity harmonics as well as the Earth's quadrupole tidal terms with a precise representation of the Earth's lunicentric ephemeris, and it gives an accuracy comparable to the way more extended semi-analytical propagator SELENA [6] for satellite orbits at altitudes from 300 to 3000 km. Extra terms of a more complete gravity model are straightforward to include using the formulas of the presently discussed analytical theory. The theory is based on deriving an approximate analytical solution of the secular part of the equations of motion using a Hamiltonian normal form in closed form. In total, we have two types of element transformations: from osculating to mean elements (as in [6]), and from mean to proper elements. The solution of the problem in proper elements is trivial, and, through the inverses of the above transformations, it allows to recover the position and velocity of a satellite analytically at any time t given initial conditions of the osculating elements at time $t_0$ without any intermediate numerical propagation. The propagator model is valid in time spans of several decades, and for every initial condition leading to no-fall on the Moon's surface, except for identified thin zones around a set of secular resonances corresponding to commensurabilities between the satellite's secular frequencies and the secular frequencies of the lunicentric Earth's orbit. Open software python and symbolic routines implementing our propagator are provided in the repository [14]. Precision tests with respect to fully numerical orbital propagation in Cartesian coordinates are reported.</description>

      <title>ARCANE -- Early Detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model, previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW) data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.53, with an average detection delay of 21.5% of the event's duration while only seeing a minimal amount of data. As more data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Evaluating statistical significance for massive black hole binary mergers with space-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Important scientific discoveries should be backed by high statistical significance. In the 2030s, multiple space-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to operate. While many works aim to achieve quick and reliable detection and parameter estimation of millihertz gravitational wave sources, dedicated studies are lacking to assess the significance of space-based detectors. In this work, we propose a framework to assess the statistical significance of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) detections with space-based gravitational wave detectors. We apply this algorithm to simulated data with Gaussian stationary noise and the complex LDC-2a dataset to measure the false alarm rate and significance of MBHB signals. We also analyze factors affecting the significance of MBHBs and design a method to mitigate multi-source confusion interference. In Gaussian noise conditions, MBHBs with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 7 can achieve $3 \sigma$ significance, and those with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 8 achieve $4 \sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates that all MBHB signals in the LDC-2a dataset have a significance exceeding $4.62 \sigma$.</description>

      <title>Long-term Timing Results of Ecliptic Pulsars Observed with I-LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing at low frequencies offers a powerful tool for studying the interstellar medium. Additionally, pulsar observations in the ecliptic enables us to study the effects of the solar wind which becomes much more prominent at low radio frequencies. The Irish station of the LOw Frequency ARray (I-LOFAR) is a sensitive low-frequency radio telescope, capable of delivering high-precision data for pulsar studies. We present a comprehensive dataset of times-of-arrival, timing solutions and dispersion measure (DM) time series for seven ecliptic pulsars observed over two-to-three years with I-LOFAR. The primary objectives are to investigate time-dependent dispersion effects and provide high-precision timing data for pulsar timing experiments. We measure DM variations through pulsar timing and analysed these across different ecliptic latitudes to assess the impact of the solar wind on each pulsar. We model the intrinsic pulse-profile variability as a function of frequency. The high-precision DM time series for all seven pulsars exhibit clear variations dependent on their ecliptic latitudes, revealing the impact of the solar wind. Some pulsars show significant changes in their pulse widths across the frequency band, while others remain stable. We examine and quantify the pulse-nulling present in PSR J0826+2637, we report evidence for DM chromaticity in PSR J1645-0317, and we describe how PSR J2145-0750's DM precision is such that it could resolve the ionospheric DM contribution. This makes it a target of interest for telescopes in areas of the globe where the ionospheric electron density is higher, e.g. the Murchison Radio Observatory in Australia. This data release underscores the potential of I-LOFAR, or any standalone international LOFAR station, for advancing low-frequency pulsar studies, particularly in analyses of dispersion in the interstellar medium, the solar wind and the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the time-domain LISA response model with central finite differences and hybridization techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) response is crucial for gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis. A key computational challenge lies in evaluating time-delay interferometry (TDI) variables, which require projecting GW polarizations onto the LISA arms at different retarded times. Without approximations, the full LISA response is computationally expensive, and traditional approaches, such as the long-wavelength approximation, accelerate the response calculation at the cost of reducing accuracy at high frequencies. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid time-domain response for LISA that balances computational efficiency and accuracy across the binary's evolution. Our method implements a fast low-frequency approximation during the early inspiral$\unicode{x2013}$where most binaries spend most of the time in the sensitive frequency band of LISA$\unicode{x2013}$while reserving the computationally intensive full-response calculations for the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases. The low-frequency approximation (LFA) is based on Taylor expanding the response quantities around a chosen evaluation time such that time delays correspond to central finite differences. Our hybrid approach supports CPU and GPU implementations, TDI generations 1.5 and 2.0, and flexible time-delay complexity, and has the potential to accelerate parts of the global fit and reduce energy consumption. We also test our LFA and hybrid responses on eccentric binaries, and we perform parameter estimation for a "golden" binary. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of our low-frequency response for "deep alerts" by performing inspiral-only Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>PECCARY: A novel approach for characterizing orbital complexity, stochasticity, and regularity</title>

Abstract: Permutation Entropy and statistiCal Complexity Analysis for astRophYsics (PECCARY) is a computationally inexpensive, statistical method by which any time-series can be characterized as predominantly regular, complex, or stochastic. Elements of the PECCARY method have been used in a variety of physical, biological, economic, and mathematical scenarios, but have not yet gained traction in the astrophysical community. This study introduces the PECCARY technique with the specific aims to motivate its use in and optimize it for the analysis of astrophysical orbital systems. PECCARY works by decomposing a time-dependent measure, such as the x-coordinate or orbital angular momentum time-series, into ordinal patterns. Due to its unique approach and statistical nature, PECCARY is well-suited for detecting preferred and forbidden patterns (a signature of chaos), even when the chaotic behavior is short-lived or when working with a relatively short duration time-series or small sets of time-series data. A variety of examples are used to demonstrate the capabilities of PECCARY. These include mathematical examples (sine waves, varieties of noise, sums of sine waves, well-known chaotic functions), a double pendulum system, and astrophysical tracer particle simulations with potentials of varying intricacies. Since the adopted timescale used to diagnose a given time-series can affect the outcome, a method is presented to identify an ideal sampling scheme, constrained by the overall duration and the natural timescale of the system. The accompanying PECCARY Python package and its usage are discussed.</description>

      <title>SKATR: A Self-Supervised Summary Transformer for SKA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Square Kilometer Array will initiate a new era of radio astronomy by allowing 3D imaging of the Universe during Cosmic Dawn and Reionization. Modern machine learning is crucial to analyse the highly structured and complex signal. However, accurate training data is expensive to simulate, and supervised learning may not generalize. We introduce a self-supervised vision transformer, SKATR, whose learned encoding can be cheaply adapted for downstream tasks on 21cm maps. Focusing on regression and generative inference of astrophysical and cosmological parameters, we demonstrate that SKATR representations are maximally informative and that SKATR generalises out-of-domain to differently-simulated, noised, and higher-resolution datasets.</description>

      <title>Identifying Astrophysical Anomalies in 99.6 Million Cutouts from the Hubble Legacy Archive Using AnomalyMatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astronomical archives contain vast quantities of unexplored data that potentially harbour rare and scientifically valuable cosmic phenomena. We leverage new semi-supervised methods to extract such objects from the Hubble Legacy Archive. We have systematically searched approximately 100 million image cutouts from the entire Hubble Legacy Archive using the recently developed AnomalyMatch method, which combines semi-supervised and active learning techniques for the efficient detection of astrophysical anomalies. This comprehensive search rapidly uncovered a multitude of astrophysical anomalies presented here that significantly expand the inventory of known rare objects. Among our discoveries are 138 new candidate gravitational lenses, 18 jellyfish galaxies, and 417 mergers or interacting galaxies. The efficiency and accuracy of our iterative detection strategy allows us to trawl the complete archive within just 2-3 days, highlighting its potential for large-scale astronomical surveys. We present a detailed overview of these newly identified objects, discuss their astrophysical significance, and demonstrate the considerable potential of AnomalyMatch to efficiently explore extensive astronomical datasets, including, e.g., upcoming Euclid data releases.</description>

      <title>Data-driven approach for extracting tidal information from neutron star binary mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs regarding the detection of compact binary mergers via gravitational waves opened up a new window to the Universe. Gravitational-wave models have been essential to this success since they are necessary to infer the properties of the compact binary system from the observational data. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, will allow for more observations of binary neutron star mergers with higher precision, making accurate waveform models crucial in describing these systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach for constructing phenomenological waveform models informed by observational data. Using mock data representing a one-year operation of the Einstein Telescope as our baseline, we demonstrate how the results improve as more events are included in the calibration. This method offers a new and complementary approach for developing sophisticated gravitational-wave models compared to classical techniques that employ analytical computations and numerical-relativity simulations. Improved waveform models will then yield more accurate parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Scalable data-analysis framework for long-duration gravitational waves from compact binaries using short Fourier transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework based on short Fourier transforms (SFTs) to analyze long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binaries. Targeted systems include binary neutron stars observed by third-generation ground-based detectors and massive black hole binaries observed by the LISA space mission. In short, ours is an extremely fast, scalable, and parallelizable implementation of the gravitational wave inner product, a core operation of gravitational wave matched filtering. By operating on disjoint data segments, SFTs allow for efficient handling of noise nonstationarities, data gaps, and detector-induced signal modulations. We present a pilot application to early warning problems in both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors. Overall, SFTs reduce the computing cost of evaluating an inner product by three to five orders of magnitude, depending on the specific application, with respect to a nonoptimized approach. We release public tools to operate using the SFT framework, including a vectorized and hardware-accelerated reimplementation of a time-domain waveform. The inner product is the key building block of all gravitational wave data treatments; by speeding up this low-level element so massively, SFTs provide an extremely promising solution for current and future gravitational wave data-analysis problems.</description>
