      <title>Neutrino spin oscillations near a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study neutrino spin oscillations in the case when they are gravitationally scattered off a rotating Kerr black hole surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. We consider only toroidal magnetic field inside the disk. Neutrino spin precession is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. Our treatment of the spin oscillations of the observed neutrino fluxes is based on numerical simulations of the propagation of a large number of incoming test neutrinos using High Performance Parallel Computing. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Limits on New Lorentz-violating Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain novel constraints on new scalar fields interacting with Standard Model fermions through Lorentz-violating couplings, bridging searches for scalar particles and Lorentz-symmetry tests. These constraints arise from torsion-balance experiments, magnetometer searches, and an excessive energy loss in Red Giant stars. Torsion-balance experiments impose stringent constraints, benefitting from large macroscopic sources such as the Earth, Moon, and Sun. Magnetometer-based searches, which detect pseudo-magnetic fields through spin precession, offer additional limiting power to low-mass scalar fields. Meanwhile, observations of Red Giant stars place strong limits on additional energy loss mechanisms, extending these constraints to higher scalar mass ranges and a wider range of Lorentz-violating couplings. Combining data from laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations, this approach strengthens constraints on Lorentz-violating interactions and paves the way for future investigations into physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Collider signatures of fermionic scotogenic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) constitute a paradigm in the search for particle dark matter. In contrast to supersymmetry (SUSY), we explore the possibility that WIMP dark-matter acts as mediator of neutrino mass generation. We examine in detail the phenomenology of fermionic dark matter in the revamped (or singlet-triplet) scotogenic model and study its collider implications. Unlike SUSY WIMP dark-matter, collider searches for the Lightest Scotogenic Particle (LSP) at LHC/LHC-HL are strongly complementary to charged lepton flavor violation probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $B$ meson rare decays play a crucial role in exploring new physics beyond the standard model. In this study, we explore the rare decay process $B_s^0 \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ in a flavor violating extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), namely the $\mu$-from-$\nu$ SSM ($\mu\nu$SSM). Combined with the decay $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s\gamma$, the numerical results indicate that the $\mu\nu$SSM can successfully accommodate the experimental data for $B_s^0 \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ and additionally narrow down the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Where is the next pentaquark state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHCb Collaboration has observed two types of hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{\psi}^N$ and $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}$ since 2015. In this work, we predict two other types of hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{\psi s}^{\Sigma}(4367)$ and $P_{\psi ss}^{N}(4379)$ within the framework of heavy pentaquark chiral perturbation theory. We suggest the LHCb Collaboration to observe $P_{\psi ss}^{N}(4379)^{-}$ and $P_{\psi ss}^{N}(4379)^0$ with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ in the $J/\psi \Xi$ spectrum through amplitude analyses of $\Omega_b^- \to J/\psi \Xi^0 K^-$ decays and $B^- \to J/\psi \Xi^- \bar{\Lambda}$ decays.</description>

      <title>Box Singularity Conditions in Box Diagrams of Decay Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 1959, singularities within single-loop diagrams have been studied. They are believed to significantly influence our understanding of experimental observables. In this study, we explore the singularities that arise from box diagrams in the decay process, which can be classified into two distinct categories. A comprehensive analysis of box singularities has been conducted, wherein we have derived and presented specific conditional formulae to ascertain the occurrence of singularities, along with the related physical scenarios.</description>

      <title>The role of $4S$-$3D$ mixing in explaining the $\omega$-like $Y(2119)$ observed in $e^+e^-$ annihilation to $\rho\pi$ and $\rho(1450)\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration has recently reported a new resonance structure in the cross-section analyses of the $e^+e^- \to \rho\pi$ and $e^+e^- \to \rho(1450)\pi$ processes, displaying characteristics akin to an $\omega$-meson. However, its measured mass, $M = 2119 \pm 11 \pm 15 \, \text{MeV}$, significantly deviates from the predictions of the unquenched relativized potential model for conventional $\omega$ vector meson spectroscopy. To address this discrepancy, we propose a $4S$-$3D$ mixing scheme and investigate the corresponding decay properties within this framework. Our analysis demonstrates that the mixed state $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^\prime$ exhibits excellent agreement with the observed resonance, not only in mass and width but also in the products of its dielectron width and branching ratios, $\Gamma_{e^+e^-}^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{R}\to\rho\pi}$ and $\Gamma_{e^+e^-}^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{R}\to\rho(1450)\pi\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0}$. The determined mixing angle, $\theta = -\left(31.1^{+2.1}_{-3.1}\right)\degree$, strongly supports the interpretation of this structure as the $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^\prime$ state. Furthermore, we predict dominant decay channels for $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^\prime$ and its partner state $\omega_{4S\text{-}3D}^{\prime\prime}$. These predictions, together with the proposed mixing mechanism, provide crucial guidance for future experimental studies aimed at probing this structure and rigorously testing the $4S$-$3D$ mixing hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effect of Chiral Torsion on Neutrino Oscillation in Long Baseline Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In curved spacetime, neutrinos experience an extra contribution to their effective Hamiltonian coming from a torsion-induced four-fermion interaction that is diagonal in mass basis and also causes neutrino mixing while propagating through fermionic matter. This geometrical quartic interaction term appears as the modification to the neutrino mass term and significantly influences both neutrino conversion and survival probabilities. Since this term varies linearly with matter density, long baseline (LBL) experiments would be a good choice to probe this effect. We put bounds on torsional coupling parameters and also see the impact of torsion on physics sensitivities in the DUNE experiment.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of quarkonia in vortical quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin alignment of $J/\psi$ with respect to event plane in relativistic heavy ion collisions exhibits a significant signal. We propose a possible mechanism for spin alignment through spin dependent dissociation of quarkonia in a vortical quark-gluon plasma. The spin dependent dissociation is realized through inelastic scattering between constituents of quarkonium and those of quark-gluon plasma polarized by the vorticity. The spin dependent dissociation rate is found to depend on the directions of vorticity, quantization axis, and quark momentum. We implement our results in a dissociation dominated evolution model for quarkonia in the Bjorken flow, finding the spin $0$ state is slightly suppressed compared to the average of the other two, which is consistent with the sign found in experiments. We also find absence of logarithmic enhancement in binding energy in the vortical correction to dissociation rate, which is understood from the requirement that a spin dependent dissociation can only come from quark coupling to a pair of chromomagnetic and chromoelectric field.</description>

      <title>Data determination of HQET parameters in inclusive charm decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work delves into the phenomenology of electronic inclusive decays of $D$ mesons, encompassing $D^0, D^+, D^+_s\to Xe^{+}\nu$. The theoretical formulas for the decay widths and electron energy moments of these decays are presented as expansions with powers of $\alpha_s$ and $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/m_c$. Remarkably, the expansion exhibits excellent convergence properties when we choose the 1S mass scheme for charm. The formulas are subsequently fitted to experimental data, and the $D$ meson matrix elements of operators in the heavy quark effective theory are hence determined by data for the first time, including \begin{align} \mu^2_\pi(D^{0,+}) &amp;= (0.09\pm 0.05) \mathrm{GeV}^2, \qquad \qquad \mu^2_\pi(D^{+}_s) = (0.11\pm 0.05) \mathrm{GeV}^2, \nonumber \\ \mu^2_G(D^{0,+}) &amp;= (0.32\pm 0.02) \mathrm{GeV}^2, \qquad \qquad \mu^2_G(D^{+}_s) = (0.43\pm 0.02) \mathrm{GeV}^2, \nonumber \\ \rho_D^3(D^{0,+}) &amp;= (-0.003\pm 0.002) \mathrm{GeV}^3, \qquad\ \rho_D^3(D^{+}_s) = (-0.004\pm 0.002) \mathrm{GeV}^3, \nonumber \\ \rho_{LS}^3(D^{0,+}) &amp;= (0.004\pm 0.002) \mathrm{GeV}^3, \qquad \ \ \ \rho_{LS}^3(D^{+}_s) = (0.005\pm 0.002) \mathrm{GeV}^3 . \nonumber \end{align} These determined parameters will play a crucial role as inputs in various physical quantities, including $D$ meson lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Galvano-rotational effect induced by electroweak interactions in pulsars"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this comment, we obtain the corrected energy spectrum for Dvornikov's paper, that is, a spectrum in which the matter term, given by $V_L$, is ''tied'' in both the radial and angular quantum numbers, given by $N$ and $J_z$. In particular, the error committed by Dvornikov arose from an incorrectly solved second-order differential equation. Besides, such an equation also had another error, i.e. since Dvornikov considered ultrarelativistic particles where $m\to 0$, it implies that all terms of this equation containing $m$ should vanish; however, that is not what happened. Therefore, solving in detail the corrected Dvornikov equation, we obtain the corrected spectrum, where we verified that for $J_z&gt;0$ (positive angular momentum), $\sigma=+1$ (upper component of the spinor) and $V_L&gt;0$, or $J_z&lt;0$ (negative angular momentum), $\sigma=-1$ (lower component of the spinor) and $V_L&lt;0$, we recover the particular spectrum of Dvornikov's paper with $m^2=0$ (as it should be).</description>

      <title>$T_{cc}$ and Hidden Charm Tetraquarks $1^+$ and $0^+$in QCD sum rules and Heavy-Quark Spin Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, $T_{cc}$ double charm tetraquark and $1^{+}$ and $0^{+}$ hidden charm tetraquarks are studied within the QCD sum rules framework. In the heavy-quark limit, the $1^+$ and $0^+$ tetraquarks are degenerate and the difference in their masses is an $1/m_c$ effect. It is shown that, although the uncertainty in the mass predictions of each of these hadrons is ${\cal O}(100\;\mathrm{MeV})$, when the mass differences are studied, the uncertainty is reduced to less than ${\cal O}(10\;\mathrm{MeV})$. Hence, it is concluded that if one of the exotic hadrons is observed and its mass is used as input, the masses of the other hadrons can be determined with a precision of ${\cal O}(10\;\mathrm{MeV})$ using the QCD sum rules method.</description>

      <title>Family Unification in $SO(16)$ Grand Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified model for the three Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetries and $SU(3)$ family symmetry based on $SO(16)$ grand unified gauge symmetry on six-dimensional (6D) spacetime. In this model, three chiral generations of quarks and leptons are unified into a 6D Weyl fermion in the spinor representation of $SO(16)$. The 6D $SO(16)$ gauge anomaly is canceled by the vectorlike nature of the model, and the 4D gauge anomalies are canceled by introducing suitable 4D localized fermions at the fixed point. The gauge coupling constant of $SO(16)$ is asymptotically free.</description>

      <title>Axial current as the origin of quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that it is impossible to experimentally observe the quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) effect without its axial current. Broadly speaking, we argue that the spiral or interference characteristics of the axial current density determine the occurrence of nonlinear or tunneling effects in any spacetimedependent quantum systems. Our findings offer a comprehensive theoretical framework that addresses the limitations of Keldysh theory and provides new insights into the angular momentum properties of quantum systems, particularly in tunneling-dominated regimes. Using Wigner function methods, fermionic generalized two-level model, and Berry phase simulations, we predict that IOAM effect can persist even in pure quantum tunneling processes. These results open the door for experimental verification of IOAM effects in future high-intensity QED experiments, such as those using X-ray free electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Insights into the $\mathbf{\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}}$ transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report novel theoretical results for the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition, utilizing a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\,\otimes\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) within the Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) formalism. In this approach, both nucleon, $N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+$, and $\Delta(1232)$'s parity partner, $\Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$, are treated as quark-diquark composites, with their internal structures governed accordingly by a tractable truncation of the Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation. Nonpointlike quark+quark (diquark) correlations within baryons, which are deeply tied to the processes driving hadron mass generation, are inherently dynamic in the sense that they continually break apart and recombine guided by the Faddeev kernel. For the nucleon, isoscalar-scalar and isovector-axial-vector diquarks dominate, while the $\Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ state only includes contributions from isovector-axial-vector diquarks because the SCI-interaction excludes isovector-vector diquarks. Once the Faddeev wave function of the baryons involved in the electromagnetic transition is normalized taking into account that its elastic electric form factor must be one at the on-shell photon point, we compute the transition form factors that describe the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ reaction and, using algebraic relations, derive the corresponding helicity amplitudes. When comparing with experiment, our findings highlight a strong sensitivity of these observables to the internal structure of baryons, offering valuable insights. Although the SCI-framework has obvious limitations, its algebraic simplicity provides analytical predictions that serve as useful benchmarks for guiding more refined studies within QCD-based DSEs frameworks.</description>

      <title>New physics effects in $R(K^{(*)})$, $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$, and $B^+\to K^+\nu{\bar\nu}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze possible new physics (NP) effects on $b\to s$ transition processes, $R(K^{(*)})$, $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$, and $B^+\to K^+\nu{\bar\nu}$ decays. Though recent data for $R(K^{(*)})$ and ${\rm Br}(B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$ are compatible with the standard model (SM), there are still rooms for NP beyond the SM. Especially ${\rm Br}(B^+\to K^+\nu{\bar\nu})$ is measured to exceed the theoretical predictions. We parameterize the NP effects in a generic way with explicit NP scale $M_{\rm NP}$ and some possible powers of it. For reasonable ranges of NP fermionic couplings we find a window of $3.17~{\rm TeV} \le M_{\rm NP}\le 14.9~{\rm TeV}$ for new particles. Implications of our analysis about specific NP models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing the QCD $\bar \theta$ term with paramagnetic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental search for CP violation in paramagnetic atomic and molecular systems has made impressive progress in recent years. This has led to strong upper limits on the electron electric dipole moment. The same measurements can also be used to constrain hadronic sources of CP violation through CP-violating interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. We employ heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory to compute such CP-violating semileptonic electron-nucleus interactions arising from the QCD theta term. We sharpen earlier results by determining the relevant short-distance effects and by an explicit two-loop calculation of meson-photon diagrams. We derive a bound of $|\bar{\theta}| &lt; 1.5 \cdot 10^{-8}$ at $90\%$ confidence, based on HfF$^+$ experiments at JILA. A further experimental improvement of one to two orders of magnitude would make paramagnetic molecular electric dipole moment experiments competitive with the neutron and diamagnetic atom program in constraining strong CP violation and higher-dimensional CP-odd quark-gluon operators.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of 95 GeV Excess within the Georgi-Machacek Model in Light of Positive Definiteness Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of a di-photon excess around 95 GeV by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations, along with the $b\bar{b}$ excess reported by the LEP Collaboration in the same mass region, has drawn significant interest in the possibility of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). The Georgi-Machacek (GM) model, which extends the Higgs sector of the SM by introducing additional triplet scalars while preserving custodial symmetry at tree level, provides a compelling framework to explain both excesses simultaneously via a light custodial singlet Higgs. In this work, we investigate whether the GM model can still accommodate these excesses when taking into account newly proposed vacuum stability constraints, particularly the positive definiteness conditions. Our numerical analysis not only confirms the existence of a viable parameter space capable of explaining the 95 GeV excesses, but also demonstrates that, compared to traditional tree-level constraints at the electroweak scale, the positive definiteness conditions further expand the allowed parameter space, thereby enhancing the viability of the GM model. Furthermore, we emphasize that future collider experiments will play a crucial role in testing this interpretation by refining Higgs coupling measurements and searching for additional Higgs bosons.</description>

      <title>The QCD Running Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the coupling of the strong force. Denoted as $\alpha_s$, it sets the strength of that force, just as $G$ or $\alpha$ specify the strength of the gravity and electromagnetism. Its value depends on the scale at which phenomena are observed. In this chapter, we will explain the nature of the coupling, the quantum origin of its scale dependence, and the crucial consequences this entails for quantum chromodynamics, the gauge theory for the strong force. We describe the theories for the calculation of $\alpha_s$, using the perturbative method at high-momentum scales (equivalently, short-distance scales) and nonperturbative approaches at low-momentum scales (equivalently, long-distance scales). We also present the experimental determinations of $\alpha_s$ at both short and long distance scales.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis with triplet scalars at electroweak scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Up until now the works regarding leptogenesis have discussed different mechanisms to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). The type-$II$ seesaw mechanism employing triplet scalars has been well studied in this context and the triplet vacuum expectation value (VEV) answering to the observed BAU is $(&lt; 10^{-2} ~ GeV)$. On the contrary we are invoking an extended Georgi-Machacek type scenario, capable of generating BAU through leptogenesis while keeping the triplet VEV at a moderate range where it plays a nontrivial role in electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). In this study we have also considered the decaying scalar mass responsible for leptogenesis to be within a TeV and hence one can probe this possibility at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) itself via different kinds of signature corresponding to different triplet VEV region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the scattering of BPS magnetic monopoles through numerical simulations. We present an ansatz for various multi-monopole configurations suitable for analyzing monopole scattering processes. Our study includes planar scattering scenarios involving two, three, and four monopoles, as well as non-planar processes where three and four monopoles form intermediate tetrahedral and cubic states, respectively. Our observations align with the theoretical predictions of the moduli space approximation. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to relativistic velocities and explore parameters beyond the BPS limit.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 2. Code &amp; Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Mass Constraints from kSZ Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We forecast neutrino mass constraints using Stage IV CMB and large-scale structure surveys, focusing on kSZ tomography as an independent probe of the growth of cosmic structure. We take into account several realistic factors, including the kSZ optical depth degeneracy. Our baseline setup consists of CMB S4 temperature and polarization (but not lensing) information, DESI BAO, the LSST galaxy power spectrum, and a Planck like $\tau$ prior, yielding $\sigma(\sum m_\nu) = 32\, \rm{meV}$. Adding kSZ tomography improves this by a few percent, while a kSZ optical depth prior can push this improvement to over $15\%$, giving $\sigma(\sum m_\nu) = 27\, \rm{meV}$. When CMB lensing is included in the baseline setup, kSZ does not further improve neutrino mass constraints. We find promising prospects for a scenario combining futuristic CMB and galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Nucleon axial, tensor, and scalar charges and $\sigma$-terms in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the nucleon axial, scalar and tensor charges at the continuum limit by analyzing three $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermion ensembles with all quark masses tuned to approximately their physical values. We include all contributions from valence and sea quarks. We use the Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate systematic errors due to excited states and the continuum extrapolation. For the nucleon isovector axial charge we find $g_A^{u-d}=1.250(24)$, in agreement with the experimental value. We compute the axial, tensor and scalar charges for each quark flavor. The axial charge provides crucial information on the intrinsic spin carried by quark in the nucleon and the the latter two provide input for experimental searches of physics beyond the standard model. Moreover, we extract the nucleon $\sigma$-terms and find $\sigma_{\pi N}=41.9(8.1)$ MeV, for the strange $\sigma_{s}=30(17)$ MeV and for the charm $\sigma_{c}=82(29)$ MeV. We also present preliminary results on the isovector quantities using a fourth ensemble at smaller lattice spacing.</description>

      <title>Prediction of lithium isotope fluxes using data-driven production cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) generally share common propagation features, leading to consistent spectral observations of secondary nuclei such as Li, Be, and B. However, the Li spectrum predicted by the CR diffusion coefficient inferred from B/C is significantly lower than the latest measurement of AMS-02. This anomaly may be attributed to the missing contributions from the heavy nuclei components in cosmic rays. By including these missing contributions the excess of the Li spectrum disappears. However, another inconsistency still exists since the calculated Li spectrum is now overestimated compared to the data. In this work, we update the cross-section model used to calculate the Li production according to more cross-section measurements. We find that the cross sections of these added reactions are systematically overestimated, and should be renormalized to the interpolations of available data. As a result, our prediction of the total Li spectrum is consistent with the measurement without discrepancy, and our prediction of the $\rm^6Li$ and $\rm^7Li$ spectra are consistent with the preliminary measurements of AMS-02 within the cross-section uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Cosmological cutting rules for Bogoliubov initial states: any mass and spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological optical theorem and the cutting rules are well-known consequences of unitary time evolution in cosmology. The earlier works showed that assuming a Bunch-Davies initial state, one can derive equations relating a wavefunction diagram with a given number of internal lines to a sum of diagrams with fewer internal lines. In particular, it can relate a loop diagram to a sum of tree-level diagrams. Recently these relations were generalised to a set of excited initial states known as Bogoliubov states and they were shown to have non-trivial consequences for n-point contact and 4-point exchange diagrams. This analysis restricted the field content to massless and conformally coupled scalar fields. In this paper, we take the final step of generalising these "Bogoliubov cutting rules" to fields of any mass and spin. We define modified propagator identities and corresponding "Discontinuities" which automatically generalise the earlier relations to fields of any mass and spin. Finally, we discuss issues concerning the far past convergence of time integrals in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar Screening Mass at Finite Temperature and Magnetic Field from Lattice QCD with Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the screening mass of pseudoscalar mesons at finite temperature and magnetic field is crucial for comprehending the behavior of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in the early universe or inside neutron stars. Additionally, in heavy ion collisions, strong magnetic fields are generated, which could significantly influence the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. The study of these screening masses provides insight into the modifications of mesonic properties in such environments, which is essential for the theoretical understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions and the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. Here, we present continuum estimated lattice QCD results on the screening mass of neutral pseudoscalar mesons at finite temperatures and nonzero magnetic fields. The simulations used (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations using physical quark masses employing the HISQ/tree action. The continuum estimation was carried out using lattices having temporal extents $N_\tau$ = 8, 12, and 16, all having aspect ratio $N_\sigma/N_\tau$ = 4. The investigated temperature ranges from 145 MeV to 166 MeV, while the magnetic field strength varies from 0 to 1 GeV$^2$. We discuss the dependence of the screening masses of various neutral pseudoscalar mesons on temperature, magnetic field strength, and quark mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gauge dependence of $c\bar{c}$ potentials extracted from Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave functions. The potentials are obtained using the HAL QCD potential method, with an extension introduced by Kawanai and Sasaki for self-consistent determination of the charm quark mass. A systematic comparison is conducted between results obtained in the Coulomb and Landau gauges. The numerical calculations are performed using 2+1 flavor QCD gauge configurations with the charm quark treated in the quenched approximation. We find that the central potentials in both gauges show excellent agreement at short distances but exhibit discrepancies at large distances. We attribute these discrepancies to insufficient suppression of excited-state contamination in the Landau gauge, which affects the linear-rising behavior of the potential at large distance.</description>

      <title>Axialvector diqaurk Mass and quark-diquark potential in Sigma_c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axialvector diquark is studied by using 2+1 flavor Lattice QCD. Being a two-quark object, diquark has a non-neutral color charge. Hence the two-point correlators of diquark fields do not have a particle pole due to the color confinement of QCD, and it is not straightforward to study the diquark mass by lattice QCD by using an exponential fit of a temporal two-point correlator. In order to avoid this difficulty, our strategy is to regard the diquark mass as a mass parameter of an effective quark-diquark model which is constructed by using an extended HAL QCD method based on equal-time quark-diquark Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave functions. We attempt to calculate the axial-vector diquark mass and the quark-diquark potentials between a charm quark and an axial-vector diquark in the $\Sigma_c$ baryon. Lattice QCD Monte Carlo calculation is performed by using the 2+1 flavor QCD gauge configurations generated on $32^3\times 64$ lattice by PACS-CS Collaboration which corresponds to the pion mass of about 700 MeV. As a result, a quark-diquark central potential of Cornell-type and a short-ranged spin-dependent potential are obtained. However, from a quantitative point of view, the ground state convergence of the NBS wave functions are not sufficient so that we obtain a larger string tension and a smaller axial-vector diquark mass than we have expected phenomenologically.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axion-like particles using lattice QCD calculations of the rate for $J/\psi \to \gamma a$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key search mode for axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to charm quarks is $J/\psi \to \gamma a$. Here we calculate the form factor that allows the rate of this process to be determined using lattice QCD for the first time. Our calculations use the relativistic Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action for the valence charm quarks on gluon field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration that include $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ HISQ quarks in the sea at four values of the lattice spacing and both unphysical and physical sea quark masses. We determine the form factor as a function of ALP mass with an uncertainty of less than 2\% across our full range of ALP masses from zero up to 95\% of the $J/\psi$ mass. This represents a substantial improvement in accuracy of the theoretical picture of this decay compared to the previously used tree-level and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ perturbation theory. We use our form factor to determine constraints on ALP masses and couplings to charm quarks and photons in several different scenarios using recent experimental data from BESIII. Our calculation paves the way for further lattice QCD input on new physics constraints from radiative decays.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Compton scattering and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production including the damping of particle states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of an electromagnetic background plane-wave field, electron, positron, and photon states are not stable, because electrons and positrons emit photons and photons decay into electron-positron pairs. This decay of the particle states leads to an exponential damping term in the probabilities of single nonlinear Compton scattering and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production. In this paper we investigate analytically and numerically the probabilities of nonlinear Compton scattering and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production including the particle states' decay. For this we first compute spin- and polarization-resolved expressions of the probabilities, provide some of their asymptotic behaviors and show that the results of the total probabilities are independent of the spin and polarization bases. Then, we present several plots of the total and differential probabilities for different pulse lengths and for different spin and polarization quantum numbers. We observe that it is crucial to take into account the damping of the states in order for the probabilities to stay always below unity and we show that the damping factors also scale with the intensity and pulse duration of the background field. In the case of nonlinear Compton scattering we show numerically that the total probability behaves like a Poissonian distribution in the regime where the photon recoil is negligible. In all considered cases, the kinematic conditions are such that the final particles momenta transverse to the propagation direction of the plane wave are always much smaller than the particles longitudinal momenta and the main spread of the momentum distribution on the transverse plane is along the direction of the plane-wave electric field.</description>

      <title>Investigating radial flow-like effects via pseudorapidity and transverse spherocity dependence of particle production in pp collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) like signatures in high multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions, have compelled the heavy-ion physics community to re-examine small collision systems for proper baseline studies. Event-shape-based studies in pp collisions have succeeded to a certain extent in identifying the rare events mimicking such heavy-ion-like behaviour. In this study, we incorporate PYTHIA8 and AMPT to study radial flow-like signatures in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV as a function of transverse spherocity and pseudorapidity. The selection of softer events possibly carrying heavy-ion-like features is performed using the transverse spherocity event-shape observable. As the particle production mechanism in midrapidity differs greatly from the forward rapidity, a pseudorapidity-dependent study is meaningful. Keeping ALICE 3 upgrades at the LHC in mind, this study aims to demonstrate the transverse spherocity and pseudorapidity dependence of the mean transverse momentum, particle ratios, and kinetic freezeout parameters in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using PYTHIA8. We observe that the isotropic events show enhanced radial-flow effects in all multiplicity classes, however, the jetty events show signatures of the radial flow-like effects only in high-multiplicity events. For the first time, we show the transverse spherocity and pseudorapidity dependence of partonic modification factor in pp collisions, which clearly shows that by choosing transverse spherocity, one can directly probe the radial flow-like effects in pp collisions at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: We present recent results in three-flavor chiral perturbation theory at finite isospin $\mu_I$ and strangeness $\mu_s$ chemical potentials at zero temperature. The phase diagram to ${\cal O}(p^2)$ in the $\mu_I$--$\mu_S$ plane is mapped out with and without electromagnetic effects. The phase diagram consists of a vacuum phase and three Bose-condensed phases with condensates of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, and $K^{0}/\bar{K}^0$, respectively. Including electromagnetic interactions, the Bose-condensed phases become Higgs phases via the Higgs mechanism. The tree-level spectrum for the mesons and gauge bosons is also derived. We calculate the pressure, energy density, isospin density, and speed of sound in the pion-condensed phase to ${\cal O}(p^4)$ for three-flavor $\chi$PT. The results are compared with recent lattice simulations and the agreement is very good for isospin chemical potentials up to approximately 200 MeV. Moreover, by integrating out the $s$-quark, we show that the thermodynamic quantities can be mapped onto their two-flavor counterparts with renormalized parameters. %to ${\cal O}(p^6)$ for two-flavor $\chi$PT in the chiral limit. We also consider the nonrelativistic limit. It is shown that the energy density can be matched onto the classic result by Lee, Huang and Yang (LHY) for a dilute Bose, with an $s$-wave scattering length that includes radiative corrections. The breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry in the Bose-condensed phases gives rise to a Goldstone bosons, whose dispersion is linear for momenta $p\ll\mu_I$. In this regime, we use Son's prescription to construct an effective theory for the Goldstone field which is valid in this regime. It is shown that its damping rate is of order $p^5$. This result is in agreement with Beliav's for a dilute Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Bounds on heavy axions with an X-ray free electron laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17333v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new exclusion bounds obtained at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser facility (EuXFEL) on axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range 10^{-3} eV &lt; m_a &lt; 10^4 eV. Our experiment exploits the Primakoff effect via which photons can, in the presence of a strong external electric field, decay into axions, which then convert back into photons after passing through an opaque wall. While similar searches have been performed previously at a 3^rd generation synchrotron, our work demonstrates improved sensitivity, exploiting the higher brightness of X-rays at EuXFEL.</description>

      <title>The Benchmark Mode $\Omega_c \to \Omega^-\pi^+$ and Its Related Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The benchmark mode $\Omega_c^0\to \Omega^- \pi^+$, which receives purely factorization contribution, is of great importance among all the decay channels of $\Omega_c^0$ decays. In this work, within the framework of non-relativistic quark model (NRQM), we calculate all the 6 baryon transition form factors involving $\frac12 ^+\to \frac32 ^+$ decays. The absolute branching fractions of non-leptonic decays $\Omega_c^0\to \Omega^- \pi^+$, $\Omega_c^0\to \Omega^- \rho^+$ and $\Omega_c^0\to \Xi^- \pi^+$ as well as semi-leptonic decays $\Omega_c^0\to \Omega^- \ell^+ \nu_{\ell} \; (\ell=e,\mu)$ are calculated although they cannot be measured directly by current experiment. Based on the prediction $\mathcal{B}(\Omega_c^0\to\Omega^-\pi^+)=(3.43\pm0.48)\%$ in our work, we further predict the ratios between interested modes and the benchmark mode, giving $R(\Xi^-\pi^+)=0.16\pm0.06$, $R(\Omega^-\rho^+)=5.33\pm0.94$, $R(\Omega^- e^+\nu_e)=1.18\pm0.22$ and $R(\Omega^- \mu^+\nu_\mu)=1.11\pm0.20$. The predictions on $\Omega_c^0\to \Xi^-\pi^+$ and $\Omega_c^0\to \Omega^- e^+\nu$ agree well with recent measured ratios reported by LHCb in 2023 and ALICE in 2024, respectively.</description>

      <title>Leptonic CP-violation in the sneutrino sector of the BLSSM with Inverse Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study CP violation (CPV) in the sneutrino sector within the B-L extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (BLSSM), wherein an inverse seesaw mechanism has been implemented. CPV arises from the new superpotential couplings in the (s)neutrino sector, which can be complex and the mixing of CP-eigenstates induced by those couplings. CPV leads to asymmetries in so called T-odd observables, but we argue that such asymmetries also lead to a wider distribution of those observables. We look at a final state where a sneutrino decays to a lepton, two jets and missing transverse momentum at the Future Circular Collider operating in hadron-hadron mode at $100$ TeV and with a luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$. In order to exclude the CP conserving scenario we need to improve traditional analysis by introducing boosted decision trees using both standard kinematic variables and T-odd observables and we need $Z^{\prime}$ boson not too much above current bounds as a portal to produce sneutrinos efficiently.</description>

      <title>Perturbative and nonperturbative QCD corrections in polarized nucleon structure functions and spin asymmetries of nucleons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) of polarized charged leptons from polarized nucleon targets and evaluated the polarized nucleon structure functions $g_{1N,2N}(x,Q^2)$ as well as the nucleon asymmetries $A_{1N,2N}(x,Q^2)$ for protons and neutrons. The higher order perturbative corrections up to the Next-to-Next-to-the-Leading Order (NNLO), using the parameterization of Polarized Parton Distribution Functions (PPDFs) given by Borsa, Stratmann, Vogelsang, de Florian and Sassot (BDSSV24) in the 3-flavor $\overline{\textrm{MS}}$ scheme, along with the nonperturbative corrections$-$namely the twist-3 corrections and the Target Mass Corrections (TMC)$-$have been included in the calculations. The numerical results for the polarized nucleon structure functions, the nucleon asymmetries and the sum rule integrals of the nucleon structure functions$-$corresponding to the Ellis-Jaffe, Bjorken, and Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rules$-$have been evaluated numerically and are found to be in agreement with the experimental results from SLAC, CERN, DESY and JLab. The benchmarking of the PPDFs of BDSSV24 at NNLO using the present data on polarized nucleon structure functions and other observables will be useful in studying the nuclear medium effects in the scattering of the charged leptons from nuclei at the JLab, EIC, DESY, etc., and the scattering of the (anti)neutrinos from polarized nucleons and nuclei at the proposed neutrino factories.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the parameters of the neutrino extension of the Standard Model</title>

Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are hypothetical particles proposed as a potential explanation for neutrino oscillations and the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the Universe. This paper focuses on HNLs with masses significantly above the electroweak scale. It is challenging to test for the presence of such particles directly. However, they leave behind effective interactions of Standard Model particles, leading in particular to charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) processes. Non-observation of cLFV processes puts therefore constraints on the parameters of the HNLs. In this paper, we find the relations between the effective operators in the realistic case when neutrino masses are non-zero and the HNLs are non-degenerate. This allows us to strengthen the existing cLFV constraints on the tau-flavors from much stronger constraints on muon and electron flavors. We also link the baryon asymmetry of the Universe to the same higher-dimensional effective operators, providing complementary bounds on these parameters.</description>

Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation by electrically charged fermions embedded in a rotating medium in an external magnetic field. We compute the dependence of the radiation intensity on the angular velocity $\Omega$ of the rotating medium for fermion polarizations along and opposite the magnetic field direction in intense subcritical fields. The polarization dependence of the photon radiation results in the Sokolov--Ternov effect -- the radiative polarization of fermions. We study the dependence of the degree of polarziation on $\Omega$. We found that rotation significantly changes the degree of polarization. We show that the rotating quark-gluon plasma acquires a finite magnetic moment that exhibits complex dependence on $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Roles of Dark Photons in Axion-induced Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By coupling to both the Higgs and electroweak gauge sectors, an axion can generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe via electroweak baryogenesis when the axion decay constant lies within the range of approximately $10^5$ and $10^7$GeV, corresponding to axion masses between the MeV and GeV scales. In this work, we explore the intriguing possibility that the axion interacts with a dark sector, particularly with dark photons through anomalous couplings. Notably, axion-coupled dark photons can play multiple roles, including $(i)$ suppressing the branching ratio of axion decay to Standard Model (SM) particles, which would otherwise conflict with the constraints from supernovae explosions, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and neutron star merger events, $(ii)$ serving as a candidate for cold dark matter if they are massive and stable, and $(iii)$ contributing to dark radiation if they are ultralight. The axion decouples from the SM thermal bath when it becomes non-relativistic, facilitating the production of dark matter dark photons through the freeze-in mechanism, while dark radiation dark photons are thermally generated prior to the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition and spin alignment of vector mesons with chiral imbalance in a rotating QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two-flavor NJL model under the rotation and chiral chemical potential $\mu_{5}$. Firstly, the influence of chiral imbalance on the chiral phase transition in the $T_{pc}-\omega$ plane is investigated. Research manifests that as $\mu_{5}$ increases, the critical point (CEP) of the $T_{pc}-\omega$ plane chiral phase transition will move closer to the $T$ axis. This means that the chiral chemical potential $\mu_{5}$ can significantly affect the $T_{pc}-\omega$ phase diagram and phase transition behavior. While discussing the $T_{pc}-\omega$ phase diagram, we also study the spin alignment of the $\rho$ vector meson under rotation. In the study of the spin alignment of the vector meson $\rho$, $\rho_{00}$ is the $00$ element of the spin density matrix of vector mesons. At high temperatures, $\rho_{00}$ is close to $1/3$, it indicates that the spin alignment of the vector meson $\rho$ is isotropic. It is found that increasing the chiral chemical potential $\mu_{5}$ significantly enhances $\rho_{00}$, and makes $\rho_{00}$ approaching to $1/3$ around the phase transition temperature. When rotational angular velocity is zero, $\rho_{00}$ is close to $1/3$, but as $\omega$ increases, $\rho_{00}$ significantly decreases, and deviates $1/3$, indicating that rotation can significantly cause polarization characteristics. The $\rho_{00}-r$ relationship near the phase transition temperature is studied. It is found that the farther away from the center of rotation, the lower the degree of spin polarization of the system. It is also found that the influence of chiral imbalance on the $\rho_{00}-r$ relationship is also significant.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurement of hadronic final states presents complex experimental challenges. The study explores the concept of a gaseous Digital Hadronic Calorimeter (DHCAL) and discusses the potential benefits of employing Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods for future collider experiments. In particular, we use GNN to describe calorimeter clusters as point clouds or a collection of data points representing a three-dimensional object in space. Combined with Graph Attention Transformers (GATs) and DeepSets algorithms, this results in an improvement over existing baseline techniques for particle identification and energy resolution. We discuss the challenges encountered in implementing GNN methods for energy measurement in digital calorimeters, e.g., the large variety of hadronic shower shapes and the hyper-parameter optimization. We also discuss the dependency of the measured performance on the angle of the incoming particle and on the detector granularity. Finally, we highlight potential future directions and applications of these techniques.</description>

      <title>Using SimTeEx to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computations with tensors are ubiquitous in fundamental physics, and so is the usage of Einstein's dummy index convention for the contraction of indices. For instance, $T_{ia}U_{aj}$ is readily recognized as the same as $T_{ib}U_{bj}$, but a computer does not know that T[i,a]U[a,j] is equal to T[i,b]U[b,j]. Furthermore, tensors may have symmetries which can be used to simply expressions: if $U_{ij}$ is antisymmetric, then $\alpha T_{ia}U_{aj}+\beta T_{ib}U_{jb}=\left(\alpha-\beta\right)T_{ia}U_{aj}$. The fact that tensors can have elaborate symmetries, together with the problem of dummy indices, makes it complicated to simplify polynomial expressions with tensors. In this work I will present an algorithm for doing so, which was implemented in the Mathematica package SimTeEx (Simplify Tensor Expressions). It can handle any kind of tensor symmetry.</description>

      <title>$P$-wave bottom baryons of the $SU(3)$ flavor $\mathbf{\bar3}_F$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $P$-wave bottom baryons of the $SU(3)$ flavor $\mathbf{\bar3}_F$ and systematically calculate their strong decay properties, including their $D$-wave decays into ground-state bottom baryons with light pseudoscalar mesons and $S$-wave decays into ground-state bottom baryons with light vector mesons. Together with Refs.~\cite{Tan:2023opd,Yang:2019cvw,Yang:2020zrh,Luo:2024jov}, a rather complete investigation has been performed to study their mass spectra and strong/radiative decay properties, through the methods of QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. Among various possibilities, we identify four $\Lambda_b$ and four $\Xi_b$ baryons, with limited decay widths and so capable of being observed in experiments. Their masses, mass splittings within the same multiplets, and strong/radiative decay widths are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:decayb3f} for future experimental searching.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Optimal Transport for Complete Collider Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the success of optimal transport metrics defined for single collinear jets, we develop a multi-scale framework that models entire collider events as distributions on the manifold of their constituent jets, which are themselves distributions on the ground space of the calorimeter. This hierarchical structure of optimal transport effectively captures relevant physics at different scales. We demonstrate the versatility of our method in two event classification tasks, which respectively emphasize intra-jet substructure and inter-jet spatial correlations. Our results highlight the relevance of a nested structure of manifolds in the treatment of full collider events, broadening the applicability of optimal transport methods in collider analyses.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung photon contributions to parton energy loss at high virtuality ($Q^2$) : a perturbative calculation at $O(\alpha_{s} \alpha_{em})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, real photon production scattering rates from jet-medium interactions in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is perturbatively calculated using the higher-twist (HT) formalism. Focus is given towards real photon production from a highly virtual (and highly energetic) quark, taking into account heavy-quark mass scales [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)], fermion-boson conversion processes [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128-170 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. A generalized factorization procedure, such as that used in e-A deep-inelastic scattering, is employed to derive an improved single-scattering medium-induced photon emission kernel that goes beyond the traditional in-medium gluon exchange approximation. Diagrams are classified based on the final state particles, and include four types of scattering kernels at $O(\alpha_{s}\alpha_{em})$ giving the following final states: (i) real photon and real quark, (ii) real photon and real gluon (iii) virtual photon corrections to quark-antiquark pair-production and (iv) virtual photon correction to quark-quark production. The collision-kernel, thus derived, includes full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete second-order derivative terms in the transverse momentum gradient expansion. Moreover, the calculation includes heavy-quark mass effects, thus exploring heavy-quark energy loss. The in-medium parton distribution functions, and the related jet transport coefficients, have a hard transverse momentum dependence (of the emitted gluon or photon) present within the phase factor. It is observed that the jet transport coefficients resemble the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resonance viewed as Weak Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum resonance, i.e., amplification in transition probability available under certain conditions, offers a powerful means for determining fundamental quantities in physics, including the time duration of the second adopted in the SI units and neutron's electric dipole moment which is directly linked to CP violation. We revisit two of the typical examples, the Rabi resonance and the Ramsey resonance, and show that both of these represent the weak value amplification when involving significant enhancement of transition probabilities and that near the resonance points they share exactly the same behavior of transition probabilities except for the measurement strength whose difference leads to the known advantage of the Ramsey resonance in the sensitivity. Conversely, as a by-product of the relationship, we may measure the weak value through quantum resonance. In fact, we argue that previous measurements of neutron electric dipole moment based on the Ramsey resonance have potentially determined the weak value of neutron's spin with much higher precision than the conventional weak value measurement.</description>

Abstract: In extreme environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron-star mergers, and the early Universe, neutrinos are dense enough that their self-interactions significantly affect, if not dominate, their flavor dynamics. In order to develop techniques for characterizing the resulting quantum entanglement, I present the results of simulations of Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions that include all three physical neutrino flavors and were performed on D-Wave Inc.'s {\tt Advantage} 5000+ qubit quantum annealer. These results are checked against those from exact classical simulations, which are also used to compare the Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions to neutrino-antineutrino and Majorana neutrino-neutrino interactions. The D-Wave {\tt Advantage} annealer is shown to be able to reproduce time evolution with the precision of a classical machine for small numbers of neutrinos and to do so without Trotter errors. However, it suffers from poor scaling in qubit-count with the number of neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Tagging more quark jet flavours at FCC-ee at 91 GeV with a transformer-based neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08590v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet flavour tagging is crucial in experimental high-energy physics. A tagging algorithm, DeepJetTransformer, is presented, which exploits a transformer-based neural network that is substantially faster to train than state-of-the-art graph neural networks.
  The DeepJetTransformer algorithm uses information from particle flow-style objects and secondary vertex reconstruction for $b$- and $c$-jet identification, supplemented by additional information that is not always included in tagging algorithms at the LHC, such as reconstructed $K_{S}^{0}$ and $\Lambda^{0}$ and $K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ discrimination. The model is trained as a multiclassifier to identify all quark flavours separately and performs excellently in identifying $b$- and $c$-jets. An $s$-tagging efficiency of $40\%$ can be achieved with a $10\%$ $ud$-jet background efficiency. The performance improvement achieved by including $K_{S}^{0}$ and $\Lambda^{0}$ reconstruction and $K^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ discrimination is presented.
  The algorithm is applied on exclusive $Z \to q\bar{q}$ samples to examine the physics potential and is shown to isolate $Z \to s\bar{s}$ events. Assuming all non-$Z \to q\bar{q}$ backgrounds can be efficiently rejected, a $5\sigma$ discovery significance for $Z \to s\bar{s}$ can be achieved with an integrated luminosity of $60~\text{nb}^{-1}$ of $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=91.2~\mathrm{GeV}$, corresponding to less than a second of the FCC-ee run plan at the $Z$ boson resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00691v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>AxionH0graphy: hunting for ultralight dark matter with cosmographic H$_0$ signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If ultralight boson fields exist, then vacuum misalignment populates them with nonzero relic abundance. For a broad range of particle mass $m$ the field condenses into fuzzy cores in massive galaxies. We use numerical simulations to test this idea, extending previous work (Blum and Teodori 2021) and focusing on ultralight dark matter (ULDM) that makes-up a subdominant fraction of the total dark matter density, consistent with observational constraints. Our simulations mimic galactic halos and explore different initial conditions and levels of sophistication in the modeling of the halo potential. For $m\sim10^{-25}$ eV ULDM cores act as approximate internal mass sheets in strong gravitational lensing, and could first be detected as an $H_0$ bias in cosmography: a scenario we dub AxionH0graphy. The mass sheet degeneracy is broken by finite core radius and by the dynamical displacement of cores from the halo center of mass, which introduce imaging distortions and restrict the $H_0$ bias limit of AxionH0graphy to $m\lesssim5\times10^{-25}$ eV. Cosmological simulations are called for to sharpen the predicted connection between the amplitude of ULDM galactic cores and the ULDM cosmological fraction.</description>

      <title>The underlying black hole phase transitions in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model with a holographic critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model exhibits a first-order phase transition curve that terminates at a holographic critical endpoint, offering intriguing insights into the phase diagram of the dual system living on the boundary. However, the specific instability within the underlying spacetime that triggers the formation of the hairy black hole remains somewhat obscure. This raises the question of whether one of the hairy black hole phases represents a superconducting or scalarized state and how the two distinct phases merge into a indistinguishable one at the critical point. This work investigates the associated black hole phase transition and the underlying instabilities by exploring a specific Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model. The approach aims to provide transparent insights into the black hole phase transitions in the bulk. By introducing a nonminimal coupling between a massive real scalar field and a Maxwell field in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, we identify two types of scalarization corresponding to tachyonic instabilities in the ultraviolet and infrared regions. These distinct instabilities lead to a first-order phase transition between two phases in the $\mu-T$ phase diagram. Furthermore, this first-order transition terminates at a critical point, beyond which the curve turns back, and the transition becomes a numerically elusive third-order one. Although one does not encounter a critical endpoint, the model still offers a consistent interpretation for the observed {\it cross-over} in the low baryon density region. We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the scalarized hairy black holes and discuss the implications of our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the hadronic structure-dependent radiative corrections to the axial-vector coupling that controls single-nucleon weak charged-current processes -- commonly denoted by $g_A$. We match the Standard Model at the GeV scale onto chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the one-nucleon sector, in the presence of electromagnetic and weak interactions. As a result, we provide a representation for the corrections to $g_A$ in terms of infrared finite convolutions of simple kernels with the single-nucleon matrix elements of time-ordered products of two and three quark bilinears (vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar). We discuss strategies to determine the required non-perturbative input from data, lattice-QCD (+QED), and possibly hadronic models. This work paves the way for a precise comparison of the values of the ratio $g_A/g_V$ extracted from experiment and from lattice-QCD, which constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Impact of Sub-MeV Dark Matter on the Cooling of Pulsating White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our galaxy, white dwarfs inevitably undergo scattering and capture processes with the interstellar diffuse dark matter. The captured dark matter forms a dark halo that eventually evaporates or annihilates. Theoretical pulsation modes and observations of pulsating white dwarfs provide predictions about their evolution. This motivates us to study the impact of sub-MeV interstellar dark matter on the cooling processes of white dwarfs. In this work, we consider the collisions between dark matter and relativistic degenerate electrons inside white dwarfs, numerically calculating the energy input and output results from scattering, capture, evaporation, and annihilation processes. Based on observational data from G117-B15, we conclude that the maximum cooling luminosity of the interstellar sub-MeV dark matter is approximately $10^{22} \, \text{erg}/\text{s}$, which is insufficient to provide an effective cooling mechanism for white dwarfs. Finally, if future observations detect a pulsating white dwarf in the Galactic center, the potential sensitivity of this scenario could extend to the region$10^{-3}\,\text{MeV} &lt; m_\chi &lt; 10 \, \text{MeV}$ and $6.02 \times 10^{-38}\,\text{cm}^2 &gt; \sigma_0 \geq 1.5 \times 10^{40} \, \text{cm}^2$.</description>

      <title>Diversity and universality: evolution of dwarf galaxies with self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter halos with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) experience a unique evolutionary phenomenon, in that their central regions eventually collapse to high density through the runaway gravothermal process after initially forming a large and low-density core. When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or "tidal tracks", of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable. This type of tidal-track model can be layered onto larger-scale, cosmological simulations to reconstruct the evolution of populations of SIDM dwarfs in cases where high-resolution simulations of galaxies are otherwise prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <title>Exploring DHCAL design and performance with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of a gaseous-based DHCAL, we investigate the potential of using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for hadron energy reconstruction and particle identification (PID) in future collider experiments. For PID, we demonstrate an accuracy of approximately 90% for neutrons and pions, and near 100% for neutral kaons and protons. The energy resolution for these hadrons is studied up to 50 GeV, with an additional investigation into the resolution as a function of the incoming particle angle and readout granularity using pions. Compared to traditional analysis methods, our results suggest that improved performance could be achieved even with coarser detector granularity, potentially making future DHCAL systems more cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Multi-axion like description of the dark sector in light of the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local methods of direct determination of the Hubble constant and $\sigma_8$ seem to conflict with the predictions made from the cosmic microwave background and $\Lambda$CDM. We propose a proof-of-concept model that models portions of the dark sector as several coupled axion-like fields, resulting in both early and late time departures from $\Lambda$CDM. We determine that the model successfully eliminates both the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, while remaining consistent with both the DESI survey and the BAO sound horizon.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the asymptotic behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high order/power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only off-diagonally across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The latter are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of higher dimensional renormalized operators in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>
