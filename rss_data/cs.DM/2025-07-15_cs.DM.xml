      <title>Multiplicative Modular Nim (MuM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Multiplicative Modular Nim (MuM), a variant of Nim in which the traditional nim-sum is replaced by heap-size multiplication modulo m. We establish a complete theory for this game, beginning with a direct, Bouton-style analysis for prime moduli. Our central result is an analogue of the Sprague-Grundy theorem, where we define a game-theoretic value, the mumber, for each position via a multiplicative mex recursion. We prove that these mumbers are equivalent to the heap-product modulo m, and show that for disjunctive sums of games, they combine via modular multiplication in contrast to the XOR-sum of classical nimbers. For composite moduli, we show that MuM decomposes via the Chinese Remainder Theorem into independent subgames corresponding to its prime-power factors. We extend the game to finite fields F(pn), motivated by the pedagogical need to make the algebra of the AES S-box more accessible. We demonstrate that a sound game in this domain requires a Canonical Heap Model to resolve the many-to-one mapping from integer heaps to field elements. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of a multiplicative modular variant of Nim and its extension into a complete, non-additive combinatorial game algebra.</description>

      <title>m-Eternal Domination and Variants on Some Classes of Finite and Infinite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the m-Eternal Domination problem, which is the following two-player game between a defender and an attacker on a graph: initially, the defender positions k guards on vertices of the graph; the game then proceeds in turns between the defender and the attacker, with the attacker selecting a vertex and the defender responding to the attack by moving a guard to the attacked vertex. The defender may move more than one guard on their turn, but guards can only move to neighboring vertices. The defender wins a game on a graph G with k guards if the defender has a strategy such that at every point of the game the vertices occupied by guards form a dominating set of G and the attacker wins otherwise. The m-eternal domination number of a graph G is the smallest value of k for which (G,k) is a defender win.
  We show that m-Eternal Domination is NP-hard, as well as some of its variants, even on special classes of graphs. We also show structural results for the Domination and m-Eternal Domination problems in the context of four types of infinite regular grids: square, octagonal, hexagonal, and triangular, establishing tight bounds.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Studying the Membership Problem for Pedigree Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $n \geq 3$, a combinatorial object called a \textit{ pedigree } is defined using $3$-element subsets from $[n]$ obeying certain conditions. The convex hull of pedigrees is called the pedigree polytope for $n$. Pedigrees are in $1-1$ correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles. Properties of pedigrees, pedigree polytopes, adjacency structure of the graph of the pedigree polytope and their implication on the adjacency structure of the Symmetric Travelling Salesman problem (STSP) polytope have been studied earlier in the literature by the author.
  The question: Given $X$, does it belong to the pedigree polytope for $n$? is called the membership problem. This article provides proof that the membership problem for pedigree polytopes can be solved efficiently. Due to the pedigree's stem property, we can check the membership problem sequentially for $ k \in [4, n]$. One constructs a layered network, recursively, to check membership in the pedigree polytope. Proof of the proposed framework's validity is given. This article's significant and far-reaching contribution is that the membership problem has a strongly polynomial-time framework.
  Since the polynomial solvability of the membership problem implies that one can solve efficiently any linear optimisation problem over the pedigree polytope. And a specific linear optimisation over the pedigree polytope (the multistage insertion formulation) solves the STSP.
  The consequence of this result is that we have proof of $NP = P$. A recent book by the author entitled \textit{Pedigree Polytopes} brings together published results on pedigrees and some new results, mainly in Chapters 5 and 6. The primary purpose of this article is to present the latest results from that book in a self-contained fashion so that experts can vet the same. Some of the proofs and presentation of concepts in this article are new.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Network Design with Restricted Link Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a digraph with two terminal vertices $s$ and $t$ as well as a conservative cost function and several not necessarily disjoint color classes on its arc set, our goal is to find a minimum-cost subset of the arcs such that its intersection with each color class contains an $s$-$t$ dipath. Problems of this type arise naturally in multi-commodity network design settings where each commodity is restricted to use links of its own color only.
  We study several variants of the problem, deriving strong hardness results even for restricted cases, but we also identify cases that can be solved in polynomial time. The latter ones include the cases where the color classes form a laminar family, or where the underlying digraph is acyclic and the number of color classes is constant. We also present an FPT algorithm for the general case parameterized by the number of multi-colored arcs.</description>

      <title>Nearly Tight Sample Complexity for Matroid Online Contention Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their numerous applications, in particular in Mechanism Design, Prophet Inequalities have experienced a surge of interest. They describe competitive ratios for basic stopping time problems where random variables get revealed sequentially. A key drawback in the classical setting is the assumption of full distributional knowledge of the involved random variables, which is often unrealistic. A natural way to address this is via sample-based approaches, where only a limited number of samples from the distribution of each random variable is available. Recently, Fu, Lu, Gavin Tang, Wu, Wu, and Zhang (2024) showed that sample-based Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS) are a powerful tool to obtain sample-based Prophet Inequalities. They presented the first sample-based OCRS for matroid constraints, which is a heavily studied constraint family in this context, as it captures many interesting settings. This allowed them to get the first sample-based Matroid Prophet Inequality, using $O(\log^4 n)$ many samples (per random variable), where $n$ is the number of random variables, while obtaining a constant competitiveness of $\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon$.
  We present a nearly optimal sample-based OCRS for matroid constraints, which uses only $O(\log \rho \cdot \log^2\log\rho)$ many samples, almost matching a known lower bound of $\Omega(\log \rho)$, where $\rho \leq n$ is the rank of the matroid. Through the above-mentioned connection to Prophet Inequalities, this yields a sample-based Matroid Prophet Inequality using only $O(\log n + \log\rho \cdot \log^2\log\rho)$ many samples, and matching the competitiveness of $\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon$, which is the best known competitiveness for the considered almighty adversary setting even when the distributions are fully known.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Symmetries of Amenable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two ways of breaking a graph's symmetry: distinguishing labelings and fixing sets. A distinguishing labeling $\phi$ of $G$ colors the vertices of $G$ so that the only automorphism of the labeled graph $(G, \phi)$ is the identity map. The distinguishing number of $G$, $D(G)$, is the fewest number of colors needed to create a distinguishing labeling of $G$. A subset $S$ of vertices is a fixing set of $G$ if the only automorphism of $G$ that fixes every element in $S$ is the identity map. The fixing number of $G$, $Fix(G)$, is the size of a smallest fixing set. A fixing set $S$ of $G$ can be translated into a distinguishing labeling $\phi_S$ by assigning distinct colors to the vertices in $S$ and assigning another color (e.g., the ``null" color) to the vertices not in $S$.
  Color refinement is a well-known efficient heuristic for graph isomorphism. A graph $G$ is amenable if, for any graph $H$, color refinement correctly determines whether $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic or not. Using the characterization of amenable graphs by Arvind et al. as a starting point, we show that both $D(G)$ and $Fix(G)$ can be computed in $O((|V(G)|+|E(G)|) \log |V(G)|)$ time when $G$ is an amenable graph.</description>

      <title>A Divide and Conquer Algorithm for Deciding Group Cellular Automata Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that many dynamical properties of group cellular automata (i.e., cellular automata defined on any finite group and with global rule which is an endomorphism), including surjectivity, injectivity, sensitivity to initial conditions, strong transitivity, positive expansivity, and topological entropy, can be decided by decomposing them into a set of much simpler group cellular automata. To be more specific, we provide a novel algorithmic technique allowing one to decompose the group cellular automaton to be studied into a finite number of group cellular automata, some of them defined on abelian groups, while others, if any, defined on products of simple non-abelian isomorphic groups.
  It is worth noting that the groups resulting from the decomposition only depend on the original group and therefore they are completely independent of both the automaton and the property under investigation. As a result, they do not inherit any aspect of the complexity of the automaton under investigation.
  We prove that the group cellular automata obtained by the decomposition preserve dynamical properties and turn out to be much easier to analyze if compared to the original cellular automaton. As a consequence of these results, we show that injectivity, surjectivity and sensitivity to initial conditions are decidable properties and that no strongly transitive, and therefore no positively expansive, group cellular automata defined on non-abelian groups exist. Moreover, we prove that the topological entropy of a group cellular automaton can be computed, provided we know how to compute the topological entropy for group cellular automata defined on products of simple non-abelian isomorphic groups and on abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Bicriteria Submodular Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Submodular functions and their optimization have found applications in diverse settings ranging from machine learning and data mining to game theory and economics. In this work, we consider the constrained maximization of a submodular function, for which we conduct a principled study of bicriteria approximation algorithms -- algorithms which can violate the constraint, but only up to a bounded factor. Bicrteria optimization allows constrained submodular maximization to capture additional important settings, such as the well-studied submodular cover problem and optimization under soft constraints. We provide results that span both multiple types of constraints (cardinality, knapsack, matroid and convex set) and multiple classes of submodular functions (monotone, symmetric and general). For many of the cases considered, we provide optimal results. In other cases, our results improve over the state-of-the-art, sometimes even over the state-of-the-art for the special case of single-criterion (standard) optimization. Results of the last kind demonstrate that relaxing the feasibility constraint may give a perspective about the problem that is useful even if one only desires feasible solutions.</description>

      <title>$(\Delta-1)$-dicolouring of digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1977, Borodin and Kostochka conjectured that every graph with maximum degree $\Delta \geq 9$ is $(\Delta-1)$-colourable, unless it contains a clique of size $\Delta$. In 1999, Reed confirmed the conjecture when $\Delta\geq 10^{14}$.
  We propose different generalisations of this conjecture for digraphs, and prove the analogue of Reed's result for each of them. The chromatic number and clique number are replaced respectively by the dichromatic number and the biclique number of digraphs. If $D$ is a digraph such that $\min(\tilde{\Delta}(D),\Delta^+(D)) = \Delta \geq 9$, we conjecture that $D$ has dichromatic number at most $\Delta-1$, unless either (i) $D$ contains a biclique of size $\Delta$, or (ii) $D$ contains a biclique $K$ of size $\Delta-2$, a directed $3$-cycle $\vec{C_3}$ disjoint from $K$, and all possible arcs in both directions between $\vec{C_3}$ and $K$. If true, this implies the conjecture of Borodin and Kostochka. We prove it when $\Delta$ is large enough, thereby generalising the result of Reed.
  We finally give a sufficient condition for a digraph $D$ to have dichromatic number at most $\Delta_{\min}(D)-1$, assuming that $\Delta_{\min}(D)$ is large enough. In particular, this holds when the underlying graph of $D$ has no clique of size $\Delta_{\min}(D)$, thus yielding a third independent generalisation of Reed's result. We further give a hardness result witnessing that our sufficient condition is best possible.
  To obtain these new upper bounds on the dichromatic number, we prove a dense decomposition lemma for digraphs having large maximum degree, which generalises to the directed setting the so-called dense decomposition of graphs due to Molloy and Reed. We believe this may be of independent interest, especially as a tool in various applications.</description>

      <title>Colorful Minors</title>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of colorful minors, which generalizes the classical concept of rooted minors in graphs. $q$-colorful graph is defined as a pair $(G, \chi),$ where $G$ is a graph and $\chi$ assigns to each vertex a (possibly empty) subset of at most $q$ colors. The colorful minor relation enhances the classical minor relation by merging color sets at contracted edges and allowing the removal of colors from vertices. This framework naturally models algorithmic problems involving graphs with (possibly overlapping) annotated vertex sets. We develop a structural theory for colorful minors by establishing several theorems characterizing $\mathcal{H}$-colorful minor-free graphs, where $\mathcal{H}$ consists either of a clique or a grid with all vertices assigned all colors, or of grids with colors segregated and ordered on the outer face. Leveraging our structural insights, we provide a complete classification - parameterized by the number $q$ of colors - of all colorful graphs that exhibit the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property with respect to colorful minors. On the algorithmic side, we provide a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for colorful minor testing and a variant of the $k$-disjoint paths problem. Together with the fact that the colorful minor relation forms a well-quasi-order, this implies that every colorful minor-monotone parameter on colorful graphs admits a fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, we derive two algorithmic meta-theorems (AMTs) whose structural conditions are linked to extensions of treewidth and Hadwiger number on colorful graphs. Our results suggest how known AMTs can be extended to incorporate not only the structure of the input graph but also the way the colored vertices are distributed in it.</description>

      <title>Quantitative central limit theorems for exponential random graphs</title>

Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are nonlinear exponential tilts of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, under which the presence of certain subgraphs such as triangles may be emphasized. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like new Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models themselves, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for the overall edge count as well as all subgraph counts. However, the microscopic fluctuations of these quantities remained elusive for some time. Building on a recent breakthrough by Fang, Liu, Shao and Zhao [FLSZ24] driven by Stein's method, we prove quantitative central limit theorems (CLTs) for these quantities and more in metastable wells under ferromagnetic ERGMs. One main novelty of our results is that they apply also in the supercritical (low temperature) regime of parameters, which has previously been relatively unexplored. To accomplish this, we develop a novel probabilistic technique based on the careful analysis of the evolution of relevant quantities under the ERGM Glauber dynamics. Our technique allows us to deliver the main input to the method developed by [FLSZ24], which is the fact that the fluctuations of subgraph counts are driven by those of the overall edge count. This was first shown for the triangle count by Sambale and Sinulis [SS20] in the Dobrushin (very high temperature) regime via functional-analytic methods. We feel our technique clarifies the underlying mechanisms at play, and it also supplies improved bounds on the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances between the observables at hand and the limiting Gaussians, as compared to the results of [FLSZ24] in the subcritical (high temperature) regime beyond the Dobrushin regime. Moreover, our technique is flexible enough to also yield quantitative CLTs for vertex degrees and local subgraph counts, which have not appeared before in any parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Multipacking and broadcast domination on cactus graph and its impact on hyperbolic graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04882v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, $ mp(G) $ is the multipacking number, and $\gamma_b(G)$ is the broadcast domination number. It is known that $mp(G)\leq \gamma_b(G)$ and $\gamma_b(G)\leq 2mp(G)+3$ for any graph $G$, and it was shown that $\gamma_b(G)-mp(G)$ can be arbitrarily large for connected graphs. It is conjectured that $\gamma_b(G)\leq 2mp(G)$ for any general graph $G$.
  We show that, for any cactus graph $G$, $\gamma_b(G)\leq \frac{3}{2}mp(G)+\frac{11}{2}$. We also show that $\gamma_b(G)-mp(G)$ can be arbitrarily large for cactus graphs and asteroidal triple-free graphs by constructing an infinite family of cactus graphs which are also asteroidal triple-free graphs such that the ratio $\gamma_b(G)/mp(G)=4/3$, with $mp(G)$ arbitrarily large. This result shows that, for cactus graphs, the bound $\gamma_b(G)\leq \frac{3}{2}mp(G)+\frac{11}{2}$ cannot be improved to a bound in the form $\gamma_b(G)\leq c_1\cdot mp(G)+c_2$, for any constant $c_1&lt;4/3$ and $c_2$. Moreover, we provide an $O(n)$-time algorithm to construct a multipacking of cactus graph $G$ of size at least $ \frac{2}{3}mp(G)-\frac{11}{3} $, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph $G$. The hyperbolicity of the cactus graph class is unbounded. For $0$-hyperbolic graphs, $mp(G)=\gamma_b(G)$. Moreover, $mp(G)=\gamma_b(G)$ holds for the strongly chordal graphs which is a subclass of $\frac{1}{2}$-hyperbolic graphs. Now it's a natural question: what is the minimum value of $\delta$, for which we can say that the difference $ \gamma_{b}(G) - mp(G) $ can be arbitrarily large for $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs? We show that the minimum value of $\delta$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ using a construction of an infinite family of cactus graphs with hyperbolicity $\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Implied Integrality in Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implied-integer detection is a well-known presolving technique that is used by many Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solvers. Informally, a variable is said to be implied integer if its integrality is enforced implicitly by integrality of other variables and the constraints of a problem. In this work we formalize the definition of implied integrality by taking a polyhedral perspective. Our main result characterizes implied integrality as occurring when a subset of integer variables is fixed to integer values and the polyhedron on the remaining variables is integral. While integral polyhedra are well-understood theoretically, existing detection methods infer implied integrality only for one variable at a time. We introduce new detection methods based on the detection of integral polyhedra, extending existing techniques to multiple variables. Additionally, we discuss the computational complexity of recognizing implied integers. We conduct experiments using a new detection method that uses totally unimodular submatrices to identify implied integrality. For the MIPLIB 2017 collection dataset our results indicate that, on average, 18.8% of the variables are classified as implied integer after presolving, compared to just 3.3% identified by state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, we are able to reduce the average percentage of variables whose integrality needs to be enforced after presolving from 70.2% to 59.0%.</description>

      <title>On Construction of Approximate Real Mutually Unbiased Bases for an infinite class of dimensions $d \not\equiv 0 \bmod 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that real Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) do not exist for any dimension $d &gt; 2$ which is not divisible by 4. Thus, the next combinatorial question is how one can construct Approximate Real MUBs (ARMUBs) in this direction with encouraging parameters. In this paper, for the first time, we show that it is possible to construct $&gt; \lceil \sqrt{d} \rceil$ many ARMUBs for certain odd dimensions $d$ of the form $d = (4n-t)s$, $t = 1, 2, 3$, where $n$ is a natural number and $s$ is an odd prime power. Our method exploits any available $4n \times 4n$ real Hadamard matrix $H_{4n}$ (conjectured to be true) and uses this to construct an orthogonal matrix ${Y}_{4n-t}$ of size $(4n - t) \times (4n - t)$, such that the absolute value of each entry varies a little from $\frac{1}{\sqrt{4n-t}}$. In our construction, the absolute value of the inner product between any pair of basis vectors from two different ARMUBs will be $\leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}(1 + O(d^{-\frac{1}{4}})) &lt; 2$, for proper choices of parameters, the class of dimensions $d$ being infinitely large.</description>

      <title>Prime and Co-prime Integer Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates prime and co-prime integer matrices and their properties. It characterizes all pairwise co-prime integer matrices that are also prime integer matrices. This provides a simple way to construct families of pairwise co-prime integer matrices, that may have applications in multidimensional co-prime sensing and multidimensional Chinese remainder theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two competing algorithms for solving Abel's equation $g(\theta(x)) = g(x) + 1$, given $\theta(x)$, have lately occupied our attention. For $\theta(x) = x (1 - x^2)$, the EJ method outperforms the ML method, consistent with experience. An immense surprise, however, lay in store for us. Two other cubics, $x (1 - x + x^2)$ and $x (1 - x)^2$, display unexpectedly erratic behavior under EJ. The reliability of EJ is consequently in question; our wavering loyalty has shifted back to ML.</description>
