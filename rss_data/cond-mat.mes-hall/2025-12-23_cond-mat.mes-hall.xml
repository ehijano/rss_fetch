      <title>Topological-Insulator and Spintronic Boundary Electrodynamics for MRI RF Coils: A Theoretical Framework for Loss, Noise, and Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRI radiofrequency (RF) coils are ultimately limited by conductor loss, thermal noise, and reciprocity constraints associated with conventional metallic boundary conditions. These limitations become more severe at higher static fields, where operating frequencies increase and current distributions are governed by surface impedance and electromagnetic coupling in the near field. In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response. Finally, we connect these results to MRI metrics including coil quality factor, thermal noise, and receive sensitivity through reciprocity-based formulations. The framework identifies parameter regimes in which topological and spintronic surface transport could reduce RF dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable coil-level nonreciprocity without conventional ferrites.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Si/SiGe Heterostructures for Large and Robust Valley Splitting in Silicon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notoriously low and fluctuating valley splitting is one of the key challenges for electron spin qubits in silicon (Si), limiting the scalability of Si-based quantum processors. In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the "modulated wiggle well," which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $\mu$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons in Yttrium Iron Garnet films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explain the reason of the apparent contradiction between recent experiments [1] and [2] and earlier theoretical predictions [3] of strongly asymmetric condensate resulting in attractive interaction between the condensate magnons. We show that the relaxation time for equilibrium between two condensates at two minima of energy exceeds the time of experiment. Therefore, it should be described by Boltzmann kinetic equation. We develop the proper kinetic theory and find the relation between the critical pumping power and the effective temperature of over-condensate magnons.</description>

      <title>Solution of Wave Acceleration and Non-Hermitian Jump in Nonreciprocal Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time evolution of initially localized wavepackets in the discrete Hatano-Nelson lattice displays a rich dynamical structure shaped by the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity. Our analysis reveals a characteristic evolution of the wave-packet center of mass, which undergoes an initial acceleration, subsequently slows down, and ultimately enters a regime of uniform motion, accompanied throughout by exponential amplification of the wave-packet amplitude. To capture this behavior, we develop a continuum approximation that incorporates higher-order dispersive and nonreciprocal effects and provides accurate analytical predictions across all relevant time scales. Building on this framework, we then demonstrate the existence of a non-Hermiticity-induced jump - an abrupt spatial shift of the wave-packet center even in the absence of disorder - and derive its underlying analytical foundation. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the Hatano-Nelson chain. Our results elucidate the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity in generating unconventional transport phenomena, and pave the way for controlling wave dynamics in nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal and nonlinear plasmonics in atomically thin heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmons in atomically thin materials offer a compelling route to trigger nonlinear light-matter interactions through extreme optical confinement in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. However, optical nonlocality in plasmons is typically associated with losses in the linear response regime. Here, we show that nonlocal effects mediate strong plasmon-assisted optical nonlinearity in electrically reconfigurable 2D heterostructures. Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation. These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Simulating alternating bias assisted annealing of amorphous oxide tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous oxide tunneling barriers, primarily formed from aluminum, represent one of the most widely adopted platforms for superconducting quantum bits (qubits). To overcome challenges associated with defects and sample variance among the tunneling barriers, the methodology of alternating bias assisted annealing (ABAA) was introduced in Pappas et. al[1]. The process of applying alternating bias to the barrier and subsequently aging before use was shown to reduce defects in the barrier. Namely, defects that give rise to two-level systems, coupling to the qubit and expediting decoherence. In this work we replicate an expedited ABAA process through a combination of ab-initio molecular dynamics and machine-learned potentials, illuminating how ABAA effects the energy landscape of the barrier.</description>

      <title>Beyond spin-1/2: Multipolar spin-orbit coupling in noncentrosymmetric crystals with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general multipolar theory of strong spin-orbit coupling for large total angular momentum $j$ in time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j&gt;1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.</description>

      <title>Spin Reorientation Driven Renormalization of Spin-Phonon Coupling in Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, featuring the simultaneous presence of high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$ $\sim 270$ K) and a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ $\sim 110$ K, is a rare system where strong interplay of spin dynamics, lattice vibrations, and electronic structure leads to a wide range of interesting phenomena. Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures.</description>

      <title>Gyrotropic Fingerprints of Magnetic Topological Insulator-Unconventional Magnet Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unambiguously identifying unconventional magnetic orders requires probes that are directly sensitive to their momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Here, we employ a framework based on Zeeman quantum geometry to study magnetotransport at the interface between a magnetic topological insulator and an unconventional magnetic insulator. By choosing the magnetic layer to be insulating, we ensure that the transport response originates solely from the proximity-induced magnetic exchange field, eliminating contributions from itinerant magnetic carriers. We focus on the linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) response, which naturally decomposes into conduction and displacement current components governed by the Zeeman Berry curvature and the Zeeman quantum metric, respectively. We uncover a universal hierarchy in which the transverse displacement IGM response exhibits characteristic even-fold angular harmonics for magnetic orders ranging from $p$- to $i$-wave, while the longitudinal IGM response distinguishes the parity of the magnetic order through robust sign-reversal patterns. In contrast, the conduction IGM component remains largely insensitive to the underlying magnetic symmetry. Consequently, the displacement IGM current emerges as a high-fidelity symmetry fingerprint of unconventional magnetic order. Using realistic parameter estimates for experimentally accessible heterostructures, we demonstrate that these signatures are well within measurable ranges, establishing Zeeman quantum geometry as a powerful and general framework for characterizing unconventional magnetic insulators via their gyrotropic transport responses.</description>

      <title>Identification and Optimization of Accurate Spin Models for Open-Shell Carbon Ladders with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes offer a controlled setting to study correlated magnetism emerging from $\pi$-electron systems. We analyze oligo(indenoindene) molecules, non-bipartite carbon ladders whose tight-binding spectra feature a gapped, weakly dispersing manifold of quasi-zero modes, and show that their low-energy properties can be effectively mapped onto an interacting set of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom. Using Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the full Fermi-Hubbard model, we obtain their excitation spectra, entanglement profiles, and spin-spin correlations. We then construct optimized delocalized fermionic modes that act as emergent spins and show that their interactions are well described by a frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain. This effective description clarifies how spin degrees of freedom arise and interact in non-bipartite nanographene ladders, providing a compact and accurate representation of their correlated behavior.</description>

      <title>Extreme Nanoconfinement Reshapes the Self-Dissociation of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water's ability to self-dissociate into H$_3$O$^+$ and OH$^-$ ions is central to acid-base chemistry and bioenergetics. Recent experimental advances have enabled the confinement of water down to the nanometre scale, even to the single-molecule limit, yet how this process is altered at the extreme nanoconfinement remains unclear. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations and enhanced-sampling machine-learning potential molecular dynamics, we show that monolayer-confined water exhibits a markedly lower barrier to auto-dissociation than bulk water. Confinement restructures both intramolecular bonding and the intermolecular hydrogen-bond network, while enforcing quasi-2D dipolar correlations that amplify dielectric fluctuations. Our results imply that two-dimensional confined water could act as a \emph{superdielectric} medium and may exhibit \emph{superionic} behavior, as observed in recent experiments. These findings reveal confinement as a powerful route to enhanced proton activity, shedding light on geochemical niches, biomolecular environments, and nanofluidic systems where water's chemistry is fundamentally reshaped.</description>

      <title>Migration of gold atoms into a thiol-bonded molecular self-assembled monolayer, forming a cluster exhibiting a Coulomb staircase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold surfaces are one of the fundamental building blocks of molecular electronics. The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconducting diode effect in hybrid Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) has recently been observed in various systems, sparking interest in novel superconducting devices and offering a new platform to probe intrinsic material properties. Josephson junctions with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling have exhibited nonreciprocal critical currents under applied magnetic fields. In this work, we investigate the SDE in Josephson junctions incorporating periodic hole arrays patterned into the superconducting leads on InAs heterostructures with epitaxial aluminum. We observe an enhanced diode effect when a top gate depletes the 2DEG in the region of the hole arrays, while preserving the overall supercurrent. Theoretical analysis shows that the physics behind this phenomenon is the increased difference of transparency between different bands in the junction. These results highlight a new pathway for engineering and controlling nonreciprocal superconducting transport in hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Signature of inverse orbital Hall effect in silicon studied using time-resolved terahertz polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the anomalous Hall conductivity induced in silicon by circularly polarized light at room temperature using near-infrared (NIR) pump-terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy. The time-resolved detection scheme eliminates the large nonlinear current generated by the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect, allowing exclusive observation of a long-lived anomalous Hall conductivity of photocarriers that depends on the helicity of NIR light. The magnitude of this conductivity is comparable to that of GaAs despite silicon's much weaker spin-orbit coupling, and its robustness against NIR photon energy rules out a spin-polarization-based origin, which occurs only in the vicinity of the bandgap. These results suggest the emergence of the inverse orbital Hall effect, paving the way for silicon-based orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Zero-field deterministic all-optical writing and annihilation of nanometer-scale skyrmion bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions are highly stable chiral magnetic spin textures with non-trivial topology. They can act as quasi-particles that can be generated, manipulated and annihilated, and hold promise for future memory and logic devices. As of now, all-optical stochastic nucleation of skyrmion ensembles, mostly in small applied magnetic fields, has been shown. However, to research their true potential, the ability to selectively toggle switch individual single skyrmions would be highly beneficial. In this paper, we demonstrate the field-free optical control of single stable skyrmions via single femtosecond laser pulses with diameters down to 175 nm, containing a fixed chirality. By engineering ferrimagnetic Co/Gd-based multilayers, we resolve the competition between deterministic and stochastic processes, and thereby overcome the challenge of optically writing and annihilating sub-micron skyrmions on demand. Our work is envisioned to fuel applications of skyrmion-based applications and opens up further endeavors in research related to the behaviour of more complicated skyrmion-based textures.</description>

      <title>Fano profile in the resonance fluorescence spectrum of a solid-state quantum emitter coupled to phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of resonance fluorescence (RF) of a solid-state quantum emitter in the regime of weak optical excitation. The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit. We also discuss how the redistribution of optical coupling efficiency between the central line and the sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions.</description>

      <title>In-situ control of hole-spin driving mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hole-spin qubits enable fast, all-electrical spin manipulation through electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR), arising from two microscopic mechanisms rooted in their intrinsically strong spin-orbit interaction. Depending on how the electric field acts on the quantum dot, the spin can be driven either by a modulation of its g-factor or by a displacement of the wavefunction. Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement. This in-situ tunability provides direct experimental access to both spin-driving mechanisms and offers a route toward optimized spin-qubit performance.</description>

      <title>Spin Response of a Magnetic Monopole and Quantum Hall Response in Topological Lattice Models through Local Invariants and Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.</description>

      <title>The effects of alloy disorder on strongly-driven flopping mode qubits in Si/SiGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Si quantum dot systems, large magnetic field gradients are needed to implement spin rotations via electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR). By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Orbital Magnetization Reveals Multiband Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that nontrivial multiband topological invariants of electronic wavefunctions can be revealed through diamagnetic orbital magnetization responses to external magnetic fields. We find that decomposing orbital magnetization into energetic and quantum-geometric contributions allows one to deduce nontrivial multiband topology, provided knowledge of the energy spectrum. We showcase our findings in general effective models with multiband Euler topology. We moreover identify such multiband topological invariants in effective models of strontium ruthenide ($\text{Sr}_2 \text{Ru} \text{O}_4$), which may in principle be verified in the state-of-the-art doping-dependent magnetization measurements. Our reconstruction scheme for multiband invariants sheds a topological perspective on the multiorbital effects in materials realizing unconventional phenomenologies of orbital currents or multiband superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the rigidity of isotropic harmonic maps from a 2-torus to a complex projective space, when they are constructed from holomorphic embeddings associated to complete linear systems. We also prove that this rigidity holds for any holomorphic embeddings without special hyperosculation points, with an extra assumption on the pullbacks of Fubini--Study symplectic forms. These results ensure the rigidity of towers of harmonic bands in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Energy Transport Dynamics and High Thermal Conductance across Single Solid-Molecule Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfaces play a crucial role in energy transport at the nanoscale. However, direct experimental observations of interfacial thermal conductance across molecular junctions have remained challenging due to the high spatiotemporal resolution required for probing. Here, we report dynamic energy transport processes across multi-component molecular junctions observed at the atomic level by employing reflection ultrafast electron diffraction. A clear temporal sequence of energy transfer is revealed at early times following photoexcitation of Au(111) surfaces chemically bonded with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols: from the gold surface layer (SL) to the head groups of a SAM and then to the CH2-CH2 methylene lattice. Remarkably, the structural dynamics of the gold SL differ significantly from those of clean gold. Furthermore, the methylene lattice dynamics exhibit chain-length insensitivity but with a length-dependent retention time to reach full thermalization. Quantitatively, we find an agreement in the increased out-of-plane atomic motions between the surface gold atoms and the SAM methylene units, signifying the nature of motion-based coupling for interfacial energy transport. High interfacial thermal conductance (~300 MW/m^2/K) and high thermal conductivity for the methylene lattice (~60 W/m/K) are obtained under the condition of impulsive heating, which provide strong support for previous room-temperature theoretical predictions and also the ballistic nature of intrachain heat transfer. This time- and spatially-resolved experimental approach will enable future quantitative assessment of interfacial energy transport across solid-molecule junctions.</description>

      <title>High-Entropy Oxide Nanostructures for Rapid and Sustainable Nitrophenol Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy materials have emerged as a promising class of catalysts, driven by their high configurational entropy originating from structural disorder in single-phase multicomponent systems. Despite their potential, the catalytic performance of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) remains relatively underexplored. In this study, we present a simple solution-based combustion route to synthesize two low-cost, transition metal-rich multicationic oxides positioned in the medium-entropy (HEO-4) and high-entropy (HEO-5) regimes. Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data confirmed single-phase formation with a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure for both nanostructures.
  The morphology, particle size, and multicationic elemental distribution were investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The catalytic performance of the synthesized HEOs was evaluated in the hydrogenation of a series of nitrophenol derivatives. Notably, HEO-5 exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity ($k_{\mathrm{app}} \approx 0.5~\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, TOF $= 2.1 \times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{mol\,g^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$), achieving rapid conversion of \emph{p}-nitrophenol compared to the medium-entropy oxide nanostructures ($k_{\mathrm{app}} \approx 0.02~\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, TOF $= 7.2 \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{mol\,g^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$). Furthermore, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the reaction, including the activation energy ($E_a$), enthalpy of activation ($\Delta H^{\ddagger}$), Gibbs free energy of activation ($\Delta G^{\ddagger}$), and entropy of activation ($\Delta S^{\ddagger}$), were determined to gain mechanistic insight into the reduction process. This study opens new avenues for the rational design and facile synthesis of high-entropy oxide catalysts, highlighting their potential for efficient and sustainable large-scale amine production.</description>

      <title>Electronic Phonons in a Moir\'e Electron Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective quantum phenomena, such as the excitation of composite fermions1, spin waves2, and exciton condensation3,4, can emerge in strongly correlated systems like the fractional quantum Hall states5, spin liquids6, or excitonic insulators7. Two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e superlattices have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring such correlated phases and their associated collective excitations8,9. Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moir\'e electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moir\'e superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the electronic crystalline nature of correlated phases, opening avenues for probing and manipulating collective excitations in correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>On the origin of energy gaps in quasicrystalline potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals, structures that are ordered yet aperiodic, defy conventional band theory, confining most studies to finite-size real-space numerics. We overcome this limitation with a configuration-space framework that predicts and explains the positions and origins of energy gaps in quasicrystalline potentials. We find that a hierarchy of gaps stems from resonant hybridization between increasingly distant neighboring sites, pinning the integrated density of states below these gaps to specific irrational areas in configuration space. Large-scale simulations of a lowest-band tight-binding model built from localized Wannier functions show excellent agreement with these predictions. By moving beyond finite-size numerics, this study advances the understanding of quasicrystalline potentials, paving the way for new explorations of their quantum properties in the infinite-size limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium thermodynamics of interacting quantum many-body systems is investigated within the framework of thermal time-dependent density functional theory using a generalized linear-response formulation for the full quantum work statistics. A first-principles route is established to reconstruct the relaxation function that underlies linear-response theory, thereby moving beyond phenomenological descriptions and enabling a consistent evaluation of all moments of the dissipated-work distribution in interacting systems. The predictive power of the approach is demonstrated for the Hubbard model subject to a staggered external potential, where the evolution of the relaxation dynamics across the Mott-to-band-insulator crossover reveals how distinct many-body phases shape the out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic response. These results provide a microscopic and transferable framework for quantum thermodynamics in correlated systems, bridging thermal density functional theory and nonequilibrium work statistics.</description>

Abstract: Analysis of space-charge effects on electron emission typically makes some assumption of continuity and smoothness, whether this is continuity of charge as in the classical derivation of the Child-Langmuir current, or the mean-field approximation used in particle-in-cell simulations. However, when studying the physics of electron emission and propagation at the mesoscale it becomes necessary to consider the discrete nature of electronic charge to account for the space-charge effect of each individual point charge. In this paper we give an extensive analysis of some previous work on the distribution of electrons under space-charge limited conditions. We examine the spacing of electrons as they are emitted from a planar surface, We present simplified models for analysis of such conditions to derive scaling laws for emission and compare them to computer simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moir\'e systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moir\'e systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moir\'e systems, including super-moir\'e with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moir\'e patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moir\'e, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moir\'e systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moir\'e systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Orbital torque and efficient magnetization switching using ultrathin Co|Al light-metal interfaces: Experiments and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the orbital degree of freedom in modern orbitronics offers a promising alternative to heavy metals for the efficient control of magnetization. In this context, identifying interfaces that exhibit orbital-momentum locking and an orbital Rashba-Edelstein response to an external electric field is of primary importance. In this work, we experimentally investigate the Co/Al system and extend the study to Co/Pt/Al structures. We show that inserting ultrathin Pt layers between Co and Al can significantly modify the orbital properties, highlighting the critical role of Co/Al orbital bonding in generating orbital polarization. We further model the orbital response of these systems using semi-phenomenological approaches and linear-response theory within the framework of density-functional theory.</description>

      <title>$p$-wave superconductivity and Josephson current in $p$-wave unconventional magnet/$s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the surface density of states in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems ($p$-wave unconventional magnetic superconductors), by using the effective model [B. Brekke, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236703 (2024)]. Owing to the noncollinear spin structure along the $x$-direction, the quasiparticle energy dispersion has the spin-triplet $p_x$-wave energy gap structure, and then zero-energy flat bands emerge at the [100] edge. Analyzing the pair amplitude at the [100] edge, odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pairing is induced in the presence of zero-energy flat bands, while even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity remains. We also demonstrate the Josephson current in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnet-conventional $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems. By the cooperation of spin-singlet $s$-wave pair potential and the $p$-wave unconventional magnetic order, the current phase relation shows the $\varphi$-junction in the high-transparency but also the temperature dependence of the Josephson current caused by the coupling of the spin-singlet even-parity pairings in the low-transparency limit, even though $p$-wave superconductivity is mainly realized both in the bulk and at the edge. Our calculations provide the possible superconducting phenomena and transport properties in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-$s$-wave SC hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Kicked fluxonium with quantum strange attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum dissipative time evolution of a fluxonium under a pulsed field (kicks) is studied numerically and analytically. In the classical limit the system dynamics is converged to a strange chaotic attractor. The quantum properties of this system are studied for the density matrix in the frame of Lindblad equation. In the case of dissipative quantum evolution the steady-state density matrix is converged to a quantum strange attractor being similar to the classical one. It is shown that depending on the dissipation strength there is a regime when the eigenstates of density matrix are localized at a strong or moderate dissipation. At a weak dissipation the eigenstates are argued to be delocalized being linked to the Ehrenfest explosion of quantum wave packet. This phenomenon is related with the Lyapunov exponent and Ehrenfest time for the quantum strange attractor. Possible experimental realisations of this quantum strange attractor with fluxonium are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanometer 3D morphometric precision of polarisation-resolved wide-field optical extinction microscopy determines the roundness of individual gold nanospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative polarisation-resolved optical extinction microscopy of individual plasmonic nanoparticles has recently been introduced as a powerful tool to characterise the nanoparticle's morphology with a precision comparable to electron microscopy, while using a simple optical microscope [Nanoscale 12, 16215 (2020)]. Here we extend the technique by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are quantitatively described by an ellipsoid model, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. Evaluation the distribution of the fit error across the set of measured particles, the material permittivity dataset and surface damping parameter g providing the best fit are found to be the single crystal dataset by Olmon et al. [Phys. Rev. B 86, 235147 (2012)] and g = 1.8, respectively. The precision of the retrieved aspect ratio is below 5%, and all three ellipsoidal semi-axes are determined with an impressive precision of 0.25 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength, and taking them into account improves the accuracy to below a nanometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing structural correlations in near-field plasmonic and polaritonic systems hold untapped potential for controlling light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. By tuning these correlations, one can reshape mode localization, coupling, and spectral distribution which are properties central to manipulating energy transport and field enhancement in nanophotonic platforms. We exploit Vogel spirals, an aperiodic geometry where a single parameter dictates spatial correlations, to show how correlation strength reshapes the modal spectrum and transient dynamics of near-field coupling. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that aperiodic configurations outperform both uncorrelated (random) and periodic arrays in controlling near-field radiative heat-transfer dynamics. These results establish deterministic aperiodic order as a powerful platform for tailoring correlated electromagnetic responses in next-generation nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Optical parametric free-electron--photon quantum interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical parametric processes underpin quantum photonics, while free-electron--photon interactions offer agile pathways to generate nontrivial quantum photonic states. These threads have so far largely progressed independently, whereas placing free electrons in a driven nonlinear system can potentially activate coherent parametric interaction channels for joint state engineering of both types of particles. Here we unify these paradigms by developing a general theoretical framework for parametric free-electron--photon interactions in a nonlinear optical system driven by degenerate parametric down-conversion. Unlike free electrons in a linear bath, here they can couple to Bogoliubov quasiparticles through two detuned phase-matching channels, where the parametric process and free-electron interactions can quantum amplify each other. Seeding the interaction with squeezed vacuum yields gain-only or loss-only electron energy spectra, and enables electron-heralded squeezed Fock states; with bare vacuum, postselecting electron energy sidebands generates high-fidelity Schr\"odinger cat states. Our results show how optical parametric interactions can quantum shape free electrons and photons, potentially enabling a quantum parametric dielectric laser accelerator that mitigates the need for temporal phase synchronization, thereby allowing acceleration probabilities to approach unity even for phase-random electrons.</description>

      <title>Ab initio prediction of strain-tunable spin defects in quasi-1D TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects in atomically thin van der Waals materials have recently been investigated as sources of spin-photon entanglement with sensitivity to strain tuning. Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Quenching the Non-Collinear Spin Order in High-Tc Layered Ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of long-range spin order in two-dimensions (2D) has catapulted the search for layered materials with magnetic ordering above room temperature. These efforts aim to understand and enhance the spin spin interactions in 2D. An emergent class of such magnets is the layered FeNGeTe2 (N = 3, 4, and 5). Here, we investigate the magnetic states over a wide field temperature phase space in the high-Tc ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using magnetization, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), and magneto-transport measurements. Our findings reveal a magnetic phase transition from a collinear to a complex non-collinear magnetic order near the temperature T* = 160 K, below which magnetic susceptibility is reduced, FMR linewidth broadened, and anomalous Hall resistivity suppressed. Such non-collinearity results from the competition between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction arising from the unusual Fe1 ordering in two possible split sites. Our study focuses on the strategy to quench the non-collinear spin order. Substituting 40% Ni in Fe5GeTe2 is found to be one such quenching strategy. This provides deeper insights into the magnetism of a high-Tc layered-ferromagnet, offering opportunities to develop 2D magnet-based devices.</description>

Abstract: Topological quantum matter represents a flexible playground to engineer unconventional excitations. While non-interacting topological single-particle systems have been studied in detail, topology in quantum many-body systems remains an open problem. Specifically, in the quantum many-body limit, one of the challenges lies in the computational complexity of obtaining the many-body ground state and its many-body topological invariant. While algorithms to compute ground states with quantum computers have been heavily investigated, algorithms to compute topological invariants in a quantum computer are still under active development. Here we demonstrate a quantum circuit to compute the many-body topological invariant of a second-order topological quantum magnet encoded in qubits. Our algorithm relies on a quantum circuit adiabatic evolution in transverse paths in parameter space, and we uncover hidden topological invariants depending on the traversed path. Our work puts forward an algorithm to leverage quantum computers to characterize many-body topological quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: One of the critical challenges in enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells is reducing the density of trap states in the light-absorbing perovskite layer. These trap states lead to increased charge carrier recombination, thus dropping device efficiency. Space charge limited current (SCLC) analysis serves as a valuable method to study trap density, requiring structures capable of selectively transporting either electrons or holes. By analyzing current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and identifying the voltage at which the slope changes, trap density can be calculated effectively. Traditional organic polymer hole transport layers such as Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, and PTAA face challenges, including moisture instability, low charge mobility, low conductivity, and high costs. This work introduces a novel hole-only device structure utilizing inorganic materials, offering improved stability, straightforward fabrication, and reduced costs compared to conventional structures. This device comprises a nanostructured NiOx layer, a perovskite layer, a copper indium selenide (CIS) layer, and an Au electrode on an ITO substrate. The performance of this structure is assessed by fabricating various perovskite layers under different experimental conditions. The trap density was successfully determined using the proposed hole-only device structure. Analysis of the photovoltaic properties revealed a clear correlation between trap density in the perovskite layers and the overall performance of the solar cells.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization as the origin of the nonlinear Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect is a new type of Hall effect that has recently attracted significant attention. For the physical origin of the nonlinear Hall effect, while orbital magnetization has long been hypothesized to underpin the nonlinear Hall effect, a general relation between the two quantities remains elusive. Here, we resolve the problem by deriving the first explicit formula connecting the electric field induced orbital magnetization to the second order Hall conductivity. Our theory reveals that the applied electric field plays dual roles in generating the nonlinear Hall effect: it first generates nonequlibrium orbital magnetization associated with an edge current, and subsequently perturbs the circulating edge states to produce transverse Hall voltage. For the experimental verification, we propose to apply a combination of direct and alternative currents to identify the circulating edge current in the nonlinear Hall effect. Based on the orbital magnetization origin, we point out that in isotropic chiral metals of T and O point groups, the crystalline symmetry suppresses the nonlinear Hall response for a monochromatic linear polarized electric field, but a non-collinear bichromatic electric field can generate a finite nonlinear Hall current that manifests the chiral correlation of the field. This discovery finally enables us to incorporate both the nonlinear Hall effect and circular photo-galvanic effect into the framework of orbital magnetization.</description>

      <title>Optically Controlled Topological Phases in the Deformed $\alpha-T_{3}$ Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Haldane's tight-binding model, which describes a Chern insulator in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, exhibits quantum Hall conductivity without an external magnetic field. Here, we explore an $\alpha -T_{3}$ lattice subjected to circularly polarized off-resonance light. This lattice, composed of two sublattices (A and B) and a central site (C) per unit cell, undergoes deformation by varying the hopping parameter $\gamma _{1}$ while keeping $\gamma _{2}$= $\gamma _{3}$= $\gamma $. Analytical expressions for quasi-energies in the first Brillouin zone reveal significant effects of symmetry breaking. Circularly polarized light lifts the degeneracy of Dirac points, shifting the cones from M. This deformation evolves with $\gamma _{1} $, breaking symmetry at $\gamma _{1}=2\gamma $, as observed in Berry curvature diagrams. In the standard case ($\gamma _{1}=\gamma $), particle-hole and inversion symmetries are preserved for $\alpha =0$ and $% \alpha =1$. The system transitions from a semi-metal to a Chern insulator, with band-specific Chern numbers: $C_{2}=1$, $C_{1}=0$, and $C_{0}=-1$ for $% \alpha &lt;1/\sqrt{2},$ shifting to $C_{2}=2$, $C_{1}=0$, and $C_{0}=-2$ when $% \alpha \geqslant 1/\sqrt{2}.$For $\gamma _{1}&gt;2\gamma $, the system enters a trivial insulating phase. These transitions, confirmed via Wannier charge centers, are accompanied by a diminishing Hall conductivity. Our findings highlight tunable topological phases in $\alpha -T_{3}$ lattices, driven by light and structural deformation, with promising implications for quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are crucial components in high-performance spintronic devices. Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but significant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by exploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report all-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals A-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic semiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic field switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in the AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition. By engineering FCGT electrodes with either even- or odd-layer configurations, volatile or non-volatile TMR could be selected, consistent with an entirely interfacial effect. TMR in the even-layer devices arose by N\'eel vector switching. In the odd-layer devices, TMR stemmed from interfacial spin-flipping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism associated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the spin-independent nature of bulk FCGT. Our work demonstrates that all-collinear AFMTJs can provide comparable performance to conventional MTJs and introduces a new paradigm for AFM spintronics, in which the spin-dependent properties of AFM interfaces are harnessed.</description>

      <title>Interaction-limited conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene revealed by giant terahertz photoresistance</title>

Abstract: Identifying the microscopic processes that limit conductivity is essential for understanding correlated and quantum-critical states in quantum materials. In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other twist-controlled materials, the temperature dependence of metallic resistivity follows power-law scaling, with the exponent spanning a broad range, rendering standard transport measurements insufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant scattering processes and giving rise to competing interpretations ranging from phonon-limited transport and umklapp scattering to strange metallicity and heavy fermion renormalization. Here, we use terahertz (THz) excitation to selectively raise the electron temperature in TBG while keeping the lattice cold, enabling a direct separation of electron-electron and electron-phonon contributions to resistivity. We observe a giant THz photoresistance, reaching up to 70% in magic-angle devices, demonstrating that electronic interactions dominate transport even in regimes previously attributed to phonons, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity near the magic angle. Away from the magic angle, we observe coexisting photoresistance and robust quadratic-in-temperature resistivity at extremely low carrier densities where standard electron-electron scattering mechanisms (umklapp and Baber inter-band scattering) are kinematically forbidden. Our analysis identifies the breakdown of Galilean invariance in the Dirac-type dispersion as a possible origin of the interaction-limited conductivity, arising from inter-valley electron-electron collisions. Beyond twisted bilayer graphene, our approach establishes THz-driven hot-electron transport as a general framework for disentangling scattering mechanisms in low-density quantum materials.</description>

      <title>"Aftereffects'' phenomenon in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$$^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals: Novel approach integrating experimental double-model analysis with density-functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03460</link>

Abstract: We develop an experimental double-model analysis, combined with density-functional theory (DFT), to investigate the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) associated with the electron-capture (EC) decay ``aftereffects'' phenomenon. This electronic phenomenon, which is reversible with temperature, is typically observed in TDPAC experiments on oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC) $\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd probe atoms and was recently explained within an $ab$ $initio$ framework based on fluctuations in the number of trapped electron holes at $^{111}$Cd [Phys. Rev. B $\bf{105}$, 195201 (2022)]. From now on, it is possible to determine, for each measured temperature and observed HFI, the set of $initial$ electronic configurations around the probe nucleus and their associated EFGs, whose fluctuations produce these dynamic HFIs, rather than simply identifying the configuration that generates the stable final EFG when the dynamic process ends. We demonstrate the equivalence between the two most used methods for analyzing this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\"averstam $et$ $al.$ (BO approach) and Lupascu $et$ $al.$ (L approach), successfully connecting the relaxation constant $\lambda$$_r$ (the damping strength of the TDPAC spectra) in the BO approach with the distribution's half-width $\delta$$_i$ of the initial fluctuating EFGs in the L approach. To address this, we perform a comprehensive DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed \emph{ab initio} analysis of defect-formation energies, both as a function of the Cd impurity's charge state, to unravel controversial TDPAC results reported for $^{111}$In-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals, now revisited. These results quantitatively confirm the physical scenario underlying both the BO and L approaches, and this new method can also be applied to other TDPAC probes without EC.</description>

      <title>Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length</title>

Abstract: The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum sensors based on electronic spins have emerged as powerful probes of microwave-frequency fields. Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability. Here, we demonstrate microwave vector magnetometry using the photoexcited spin triplet of deuterated pentacene molecules, operating at zero external magnetic field and room temperature. We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of $1~\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. These results establish pentacene-based molecular spins as a practical and high-performance platform for microwave quantum sensing, and the control techniques are broadly applicable to other molecular and solid-state spin systems.</description>

      <title>A quantum model for Johnson noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:1404.6099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Johnson noise is a small random voltage that appears between terminals of any resistor interacting with its thermal bath at temperature T. It looks like continuous, but the discreteness of the electrical charge suggests its discrete origin coming from the charge noise due to random translocations of individual electrons between terminals. The capacitance allowing these translocations would quantize the energy entering the resistor in this way, thus acting as the antenna of the resistor to pick up thermal energy in the form of charge unbalances (fluctuations of energy) between its terminals. The subsequent relaxations of these fluctuations by the conductance G=1/R of the resistor (the collective reaction of all its carriers) would give rise to its Johnson noise. This collective reaction to dissipate fluctuations of energy caused by individual electrons, agrees with the Fluctuation-Dissipation framework that Callen and Welton proposed in 1951 for noisy processes.</description>

      <title>Emergent $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking of collective modes with topological critical phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.00450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry yields rich critical behavior in non-Hermitian systems, and has stimulated much interest, albeit most previous studies were performed within the single-particle or mean-field framework. Here, by studying the collective excitations of a Fermi superfluid with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric spin-orbit coupling, we uncover an emergent $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking in the Anderson-Bogoliubov (AB) collective modes, even as the superfluid ground state retains an unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. {The critical point of the transition is marked by a non-analytic kink in the speed of sound, which derives from the coalescence and annihilation of the AB mode and its hole partner, reminiscent of the particle-antiparticle annihilation. The system consequently becomes immune to low-frequency external perturbations at the critical point, a phenomenon associated with the spectral topology of the complex quasiparticle dispersion. This critical phenomenon offers a fascinating route toward perturbation-free quantum states.</description>

      <title>Isolated zero mode in a quantum computer from a duality twist</title>

Abstract: Investigating the interplay of dualities, generalized symmetries, and topological defects beyond theoretical models is an important challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum materials. A simple model exhibiting this physics is the transverse-field Ising model, which can host a topological defect that performs the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. When acting on one point in space, this duality defect imposes the duality twisted boundary condition and binds a single zero mode. This zero mode is unusual as it lacks a localized partner in the same $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector and has an infinite lifetime, even in finite systems. Using Floquet driving of a closed Ising chain with a duality defect, we generate this zero mode in a digital quantum computer. We detect the mode by measuring its associated persistent autocorrelation function using an efficient sampling protocol and a compound strategy for error mitigation. We also show that the zero mode resides at the domain wall between two regions related by a Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. Finally, we highlight the robustness of the isolated zero mode to integrability- and symmetry-breaking perturbations. Our findings provide a method for exploring exotic topological defects, associated with noninvertible generalized symmetries, in digitized quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Kagome materials have attracted enormous research interest recently owing to their diverse topological phases and manifestation of electronic correlation. Here, we present the electronic structure of a distorted ferromagnetic kagome metal, NdTi3Bi4, exhibiting a transition temperature of 9 K. Our investigation employs a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discover the presence of two flat bands which are found to originate from the kagome structure formed by Ti atoms with major contribution from Ti dxy and Ti dx2-y2 orbitals. We also observed multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) in its electronic structure, with one VHS lying near the Fermi level. The ARPES data reveals the existence of Dirac cone at the K point, a finding which is corroborated by our DFT calculations. These findings present detailed electronic structure capable of hosting correlation-driven phenomenon in this novel ferromagnetic kagome metal.</description>

      <title>Power Laws for the Thermal Slip Length of a Liquid/Solid Interface From the Structure and Frequency Response of the Contact Zone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05443v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The newest and most powerful electronic chips for applications like artificial intelligence generate so much heat that liquid based cooling has become indispensable to prevent breakdown from thermal runaway effects. While cooling schemes like microfluidic networks or liquid immersion are proving effective for now, further progress requires tackling an age old problem, namely the intrinsic thermal impedance of the liquid/solid (L/S) interface, quantified either by the thermal boundary resistance or thermal slip length. While there exist well known models for estimating bounds on the thermal impedance of a superfluid/metal interface, no analytic models nor experimental data are available for normal liquid/solid interfaces. Researchers therefore rely on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into phonon transfer at the L/S interface. Here we explore correlated order and motion within the L/S contact zone in an effort to extract general scaling relations for the thermal slip length in Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems. We focus on the in-plane structure factor and dominant vibrational frequency of the first solid and liquid layer for 180 systems. When scaled by the temperature of the liquid contact layer and characteristic LJ interaction distance, the data collapse onto two power law equations, one quantifying the reduction in thermal impedance from enhanced in-plane translational order and the other from enhanced frequency matching in the contact zone. More generally, these power law relations highlight the critical role of surface acoustic phonons, an area of focus which may prove more useful to development of analytic models and instrumentation for validating the relations proposed.</description>

      <title>Witnessing non-stationary and non-Markovian environments with a quantum sensor</title>

Abstract: Quantum sensors offer exceptional sensitivity to nanoscale magnetic fluctuations, where non-stationary effects -- such as spin diffusion -- and non-Markovian dynamics arising from coupling to few environmental degrees of freedom play critical roles. Because fully reconstructing the microscopic structure of realistic spin baths is often infeasible, a practical challenge is to identify the dynamical features that are actually encoded in the sensor's decoherence signal. Here, we demonstrate how quantum sensors can operationally characterize the statistical nature of environmental noise, distinguishing between stationary and non-stationary behaviors, as well as Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a platform, we develop a physical noise model that captures the essential dynamical features of realistic environments relevant to sensor observables -- independently of the microscopic bath details -- and provides analytical predictions for Ramsey decay across different regimes. These predictions are experimentally validated through controlled noise injection with tunable correlation properties. Our results showcase the capability of quantum sensors to isolate and identify key dynamical properties of complex environments, without requiring full microscopic bath reconstruction. This work clarifies the operational signatures of non-stationarity and non-Markovian behavior at the nanoscale and lays the foundation for strategies that mitigates decoherence while exploiting environmental dynamics for enhanced quantum sensing.</description>

Abstract: Spatially varying electric fields are prevalent throughout nature, such as in nanoporous materials and biological membranes, and technology, e.g, patterned electrodes and van der Waals heterostructures. While uniform fields cause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply reorient the constituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a dielectrophoretic force, offering fine control of polar fluids even in the absence of free charges. Despite their vast potential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in nanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials. EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level due to the absence of a rigorous first-principles theory of electrostriction. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid state theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and capillarity. We demonstrate that dielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase transition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our findings establish "dielectrocapillarity" -- the use of EFGs to manipulate confined fluids -- as a powerful mechanism for controlling volumetric capacity in nanopores, holding immense potential for energy storage, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in neuromorphic nanofluidics. Furthermore, by linking nanoscale dielectrocapillarity to macroscopic dielectrowetting, we establish a foundation for field-controlled wetting and adsorption phenomena of polar fluids across length scales.</description>

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO$_2$) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO$_2$ interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in Hahn-echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin relaxation with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: Superfluorescence (SF) is the collective emission of intense, coherent light from an interacting ensemble of quantum emitters1-4. While SF has been observed in several solid-state materials5-8, the spontaneous generation of circularly polarized SF from chiral materials (chiral SF) has not been realized9,10. Here, we report the first observation of chiral SF originating from edge states in large-area (&gt;100 um * 100 um) vertically aligned chiral perovskite superlattices at room-temperature. Theoretical quantum optics calculations describe the transition from initially unpolarized, incoherent spontaneous emission to a coherent chiral SF state, quantitatively reproducing both the experimentally observed generation of circular polarization (up to ~14%) and its reversal in sign with opposite material handedness. Moreover, we show that both the intensity and the degree of circular polarization of chiral SF can be modulated by a weak magnetic field, enabling precise control over solid-state quantum light emission at room temperature. Our findings demonstrate an interplay between chirality and many-body quantum coherence, thereby revealing promising new directions for chirality-controlled quantum-optical applications.</description>

      <title>Electrostatically Assembled Open Square and Checkerboard Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmable assembly of nanoparticles into structures other than hexagonal lattices remains challenging. Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with four Majorana zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions formed by finite-length topological superconductors host four Majorana zero modes when the phase difference between the superconductors is $\varphi=\pi$ and their length is larger than the Majorana localization length. While this picture is understood in terms of a Hermitian description of isolated junctions, unavoidable transport conditions due to coupling to reservoirs make them open and ground for non-Hermitian effects that still remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Hermiticity on Josephson junctions hosting four Majorana zero modes when they are coupled to normal leads. We demonstrate that, depending on whether inner or outer Majorana zero modes are subjected to non-Hermiticity, Andreev exceptional points can form between lowest (higher energy) Andreev bound states connected by stable zero real energy lines. We further find that the Andreev exceptional points give rise to strong local and nonlocal spectral weights, thus providing a way for their identification via, e.g., conductance measurements. Our findings unveil non-Hermiticity for designing non-Hermitian topological phases and for operating Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions hosting Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and charge transport properties of oxygen-deficient Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21621v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental and theoretical studies of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia physical properties are hot topics in fundamental and applied science. However, magnetic and charge transport properties of HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles are very poorly studied theoretically and experimentally. In this work we observed a superparamagnetic-like and superparaelectric-like response of ultra-small (5 - 10 nm in size) HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The EPR spectra of HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders reveal the presence of paramagnetic defect centers, which are the oxygen vacancies with one captured electron, and hafnium or zirconium ions that changed their oxidation state from +4 to +3 due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and significant degree "y" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in the HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the dominant presence of the orthorhombic phase. Due to the flexo-electro-chemical strains, presumably induced by the oxygen vacancies and their complexes accumulated near their surface, the ultra-small HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles reveal superparaelectric-like behavior, posistor-like effect and significant values of accumulated charge. We observed that the quasi-static relative dielectric permittivity of the HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders overcomes 107 and related the colossal values with the superparaelectric state of the nanoparticles cores induced by the flexo-electro-chemical strains.</description>

      <title>Splitting obstructions and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants in time-reversal symmetric topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fu-Kane-Mele $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index characterizes two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric topological phases of matter. We shed some light on some features of this index by investigating projection-valued maps endowed with a fermionic time-reversal symmetry.
  Our main contributions are threefold. First, we establish a decomposition theorem, proving that any such projection-valued map admits a splitting into two projection-valued maps that are related to each other via time-reversal symmetry. Second, we provide a complete homotopy classification theorem for these maps, thereby clarifying their topological structure. Third, by means of the previous analysis, we connect the Fu-Kane-Mele index to the Chern number of one of the factors in the previously-mentioned decomposition, which in turn allows to exhibit how the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued topological obstruction to constructing a periodic and smooth Bloch frame for the projection-valued map, measured by the Fu-Kane-Mele index, can be concentrated in a single pseudo-periodic Kramers pair.</description>

      <title>Superradiant decay in non-Markovian Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</description>

      <title>Wave-packet dynamics in pseudo-Hermitian lattices: Coexistence of Hermitian and non-Hermitian wavefronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates wave-packet dynamics in non-Hermitian lattice systems and reveals a surprising phenomenon: The simultaneous propagation of two distinct wavefronts, one traveling at the non-Hermitian velocity and the other at the Hermitian velocity. We show that this dual-front behavior arises naturally in systems governed by a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Using the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model as our primary example, we demonstrate that this coexistence is essential for understanding a wide array of unconventional dynamical effects, including abrupt ``non-Hermitian reflections'', sudden shifts of Gaussian wave-packets, and disorder-induced emergent packets seeded by the small initial tails. We present analytic predictions that closely match numerical simulations. These results may offer new insight into the topology of non-Hermitian systems and point toward measurable experimental consequences.</description>
