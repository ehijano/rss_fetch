      <title>Physics-informed neural network for nonlinear dynamics of self-trapped necklace beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is used to produce a variety of self-trapped necklace solutions of the (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We elaborate the analysis for the existence and evolution of necklace patterns with integer, half-integer, and fractional reduced orbital angular momenta by means of PINN. The patterns exhibit phenomena similar to rotation of rigid bodies and centrifugal force. Even though the necklaces slowly expand (or shrink), they preserve their structure in the course of the quasi-stable propagation over several diffraction lengths, which is completely different from the ordinary fast diffraction-dominated dynamics. By comparing different ingredients, including the training time, loss value and $\mathbb{L}_{2}$ error, PINN accurately predicts specific nonlinear dynamical properties of the evolving necklace patterns. Furthermore, we perform the data-driven discovery of parameters for both clean and perturbed training data, adding $1\%$ random noise in the latter case. The results reveal that PINN not only effectively emulates the solution of partial differential equations, but also offers applications for predicting the nonlinear dynamics of physically relevant types of patterns.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional imaging with partially coherent light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unidirectional imagers form images of input objects only in one direction, e.g., from field-of-view (FOV) A to FOV B, while blocking the image formation in the reverse direction, from FOV B to FOV A. Here, we report unidirectional imaging under spatially partially coherent light and demonstrate high-quality imaging only in the forward direction (A-&gt;B) with high power efficiency while distorting the image formation in the backward direction (B-&gt;A) along with low power efficiency. Our reciprocal design features a set of spatially engineered linear diffractive layers that are statistically optimized for partially coherent illumination with a given phase correlation length. Our analyses reveal that when illuminated by a partially coherent beam with a correlation length of ~1.5 w or larger, where w is the wavelength of light, diffractive unidirectional imagers achieve robust performance, exhibiting asymmetric imaging performance between the forward and backward directions - as desired. A partially coherent unidirectional imager designed with a smaller correlation length of less than 1.5 w still supports unidirectional image transmission, but with a reduced figure of merit. These partially coherent diffractive unidirectional imagers are compact (axially spanning less than 75 w), polarization-independent, and compatible with various types of illumination sources, making them well-suited for applications in asymmetric visual information processing and communication.</description>

      <title>Optical frequency combs significantly spanned to broad bandwidths by an optomechanical resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency comb, as a spectrum made of discrete and equally spaced spectral lines, is a light source with essential applications in modern technology. Cavity optomechanical systems were found to be a feasible candidate for realizing on-chip frequency comb with low repetition rate. However, it was difficult to increase the comb line numbers of this type of frequency combs because the mechanical oscillation amplitude of such system, which determines the frequency comb bandwidth, cannot quickly increase with pump laser power. Here, we develop a new approach to generate broadband optomechanical frequency comb by employing a different mechanism to enhance the mechanical oscillation. Two pump tones with their frequency difference matching the mechanical frequency will drive the system into a self-organized nonlinear resonance and thus tremendously transfer the energy to the mechanical resonator. As a result, more than $10000$ or even more comb lines become available under the pump laser power in the order of milliwatt. A unique feature of the self-organized resonance is the mechanical frequency locking so that, within a certain range of the frequency difference between two drive tones, the distance between comb teeth can be locked by the two drive tones and becomes independent of any change of pump power. This property guarantees a stable repetition rate of the generated frequency comb.</description>

      <title>Unitary control of multiport wave transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling wave transmission is crucial for various applications. In this work, we apply the concept of unitary control to manipulate multiport wave transmission. Unitary control aims to control the behaviors of a set of orthogonal waves simultaneously. The approach fully harnesses the capability of wavefront shaping techniques, with promising applications in communication, imaging, and photonic integrated circuits. Here we present a detailed theory of unitary control of wave transmission, focusing on two key characteristics: total (power) transmittance and direct (field) transmission. The total transmittance for an input port represents the fraction of total transmitted power with respect to the input power for wave incident from an input port. The direct transmission for an input port denotes the complex transmission amplitude from that input port to its corresponding output port. We address two main questions: (i) the achievable total transmittance and direct transmission for each port, and (ii) the configuration of unitary control to attain desired transmission values for each port. Our theory illustrates that unitary control enables uniform total transmittance and direct transmission across any medium. Furthermore, we show that reciprocity and energy conservation enforce direct symmetry constraints on wave transmission in both forward and backward directions under unitary control.</description>

      <title>Unitary control of partially coherent waves. I. Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent control of wave absorption has important applications in areas such as energy harvesting, imaging, and sensing. However, most practical scenarios involve the absorption of partially coherent rather than fully coherent waves. Here we present a systematic theory of unitary control over the absorption of partially coherent waves by linear systems. Given an absorbing system and incident partially coherent wave, we provide analytical expressions for the range of attainable absorptivity under arbitrary unitary transformations of the incident field. We also present an explicit algorithm to construct the unitary control scheme that achieves any desired absorptivity within that attainable range. As applications of our theory, we derive the conditions required for achieving two new phenomena - partially coherent perfect absorption and partially coherent zero absorption. Furthermore, we prove a theorem relating the coherence properties of the incident field, as quantified by majorization, to the resulting absorption intervals. Our results provide both fundamental insights and practical prescriptions for exploiting unitary control to shape the absorption of partially coherent waves. The theory applies across the electromagnetic spectrum as well as to other classical wave systems such as acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Unitary control of partially coherent waves. II. Transmission or reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control of wave transmission and reflection is crucial for applications in communication, imaging, and sensing. However, many practical scenarios involve partially coherent waves rather than fully coherent ones. We present a systematic theory for the unitary control of partially coherent wave transmission and reflection. For a linear time-invariant system with an incident partially coherent wave, we derive analytical expressions for the range of attainable total transmittance and reflectance under arbitrary unitary transformations. We also introduce an explicit algorithm to construct a unitary control scheme that achieves any desired transmission or reflection within the attainable range. As applications of our theory, we establish conditions for four novel phenomena: partially coherent perfect transmission, partially coherent perfect reflection, partially coherent zero transmission, and partially coherent zero reflection. We also prove a theorem that relates the degree of coherence of the incident field, quantified by the majorization order, to the resulting transmission and reflection intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that reciprocity (or energy conservation) imposes direct symmetry constraints on bilateral transmission (or transmission and reflection) of partially coherent waves under unitary control. Our results provide fundamental insights and practical guidelines for using unitary control to manipulate the transmission and reflection of partially coherent waves. This theory applies to various wave systems, including electromagnetic and acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Nanometric dual-comb ranging using photon-level microcavity solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absolute distance measurement with low return power, fast measurement speed, high precision, and immunity to intensity fluctuations is highly demanded in nanotechnology. However, achieving all these objectives simultaneously remains a significant challenge for miniaturized systems. Here, we demonstrate dual-comb ranging (DCR) that encompasses all these capabilities by using counter-propagating (CP) solitons generated in an integrated Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonator. We derive equations linking the DCR precision with comb line powers, revealing the advantage of microcomb's large line spacing in precise ranging. Leveraging the advantage, our system reaches 1-nm-precision and measures nm-scale vibration at frequencies up to 0.9 MHz. We also show that precise DCR is possible even in the presence of strong intensity noise and loss, using a mean received photon number as low as 5.5$\times$10$^{-4}$ per pulse. Our work establishes an optimization principle for dual-comb systems and bridges high performance ranging with foundry-manufactured photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic nonlinear conversion processes in periodically-poled thin-film lithium niobate waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) waveguides, which enable efficient quadratic nonlinear processes, serve as crucial foundation for classical and quantum signal processing with photonic integrated circuits. To expand their application scope, we provide, to our best knowledge, the first investigation of nonlinear conversion processes in periodically poled TFLN waveguides at cryogenic condition. Through systematic experimental characterization, we find that the periodically poled TFLN waveguide maintains consistent conversion efficiencies at both cryogenic and room temperatures for both classical second-harmonic generation and quantum photon-pair generation processes, demonstrating the significant potential of TFLN wavelength conversion devices for cryogenic applications. This breakthrough will foster future scalable quantum photonic systems and optical interfacing among different cryogenic platforms.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear vortex dichroism in chiral molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery that linearly polarized light with a helical wavefront can exhibit vortex dichroism (also referred to as helical dichroism) has opened up new horizons in chiroptical spectroscopy with structured chiral light. Recent experiments have now pushed optical activity with vortex beams into the regime of nonlinear optics. Here we present the theory of two-photon absorption (TPA) of focused optical vortices by chiral molecules: nonlinear vortex dichroism (NVD). We discover that highly distinct features arise in the case of TPA with focused vortex beams, including the ability to probe chiral molecular structure not accessible to current methods and that the differential rate of TPA is significantly influenced by the orientation of the state of linear polarization. This work provides strong evidence that combining nonlinear optical activity with structured light provides new and improved routes to studying molecular chirality.</description>

      <title>Quantum Efficiency the B-centre in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: B-centres in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are gaining significant research interest for quantum photonics applications due to precise emitter positioning and highly reproducible emission wavelengths. Here, we leverage the layered nature of hBN to directly measure the quantum efficiency (QE) of single B-centres. The defects were engineered in a 35 nm flake of hBN using electron beam irradiation, and the local dielectric environment was altered by transferring a 250 nm hBN flake on top of the one containing the emitters. By analysing the resulting change in measured lifetimes, we determined the QE of B-centres in the thin flake of hBN, as well as after the transfer. Our results indicate that B-centres located in thin flakes can exhibit QEs higher than 40%. Near-unity QEs are achievable under reasonable Purcell enhancement for emitters embedded in thick flakes of hBN, highlighting their promise for quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Quasi Monolithic Fiber Collimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric displacement measurements, especially in space interferometry applications, face challenges from thermal expansion. Bonded assemblies of ultra-low thermal expansion glass-ceramics offer a solution; however, transitioning from light transport in fibers to free beam propagation presents a notable challenge. These experiments often need an interface to convert between laser beams propagating through fiber optics into a well-defined free beam and vice versa. These interfaces must also be made of rigid glass pieces that can be bonded to a glass base plate. Current designs for these fiber collimators, often called fiber injector optical sub-assemblies, require multiple glass parts fabricated to very tight tolerances and assembled with special alignment tools. We present a simplified quasi-monolithic fiber collimator that can generate a well-collimated laser beam. The complexity and tolerances of bonding are reduced by combining the alignment of the fiber mode to the imaging lens in one step with active mode control: the welding of the fiber to the glass body. We produce several of these designs and test that the desired light field is achieved, its profile is described as a Gaussian beam, and the beam-pointing stability is acceptable for such a piece. In each case, they perform at least as well as a standard commercial fiber collimator. These Quasi Monolithic Fiber Collimators offer a promising and easy-to-implement solution to convert between free beam and fiber-coupled lasers in experiments sensitive to long term thermal drifts.</description>

      <title>Bulk-spatiotemporal vortex correspondence in gyromagnetic double-zero-index media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic double-zero-index media, distinguished by concurrently zero-valued permittivity and permeability, exhibit extraordinary properties not found in nature. Remarkably, the notion of zero-index can be substantially expanded by generalizing the constitutive parameters from null scalars to nonreciprocal tensors with nonzero matrix elements but zero determinants. Here, we experimentally realize such a new class of gyromagnetic double-zero-index metamaterials possessing both double-zero-index features and nonreciprocal hallmarks. As an intrinsic property, this metamaterial always emerges at a spin-1/2 Dirac point of a topological phase transition. We discover and rigorously prove that a spatiotemporal reflection vortex singularity is always anchored to the metamaterial's Dirac point, with the vortex charge being determined by the topological invariant leap across the phase transition. This establishes a unique bulk-spatiotemporal vortex correspondence that extends the protected boundary effects into the time domain and exclusively characterizes topological phase transition points, setting it apart from any pre-existing bulk-boundary correspondence. Based on this correspondence, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a mechanism to deterministically generate optical spatiotemporal vortex pulses with firmly fixed central frequency and momentum, hence showing unparalleled robustness. Our findings uncover deep connections between zero-refractive-index photonics, topological photonics, and singular optics, opening the avenue for the manipulation of space-time topological light fields via the inherent topology of extreme-parameter metamaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic microring resonators are used in a variety of chip-integrated sensing applications where they allow to measure transmission intensity changes upon external signals with a sensitivity that scales linearly with the Q-factor. In this work, we suggest to exploit the nonlinear self-phase-modulation effect to increase the overall sensitivity by an additional gain factor appearing when the operational point of the nonlinear resonator is chosen just at the cross-over from the mono- to the bistable regime. We present the theoretical idea together with a first proof of concept experiment displaying a gain factor of 22 on a chip-integrated silicon-nitride resonator.</description>

      <title>Coupler enabled tunable dipole-dipole coupling between optically levitated nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple optically levitated particles in vacuum can exhibit electrostatic interactions, optical binding, or non-reciprocal light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, making them promising platforms for exploring mesoscopic entanglement and complex interactions. However, in optical trap arrays, individually controlling the position and polarization of each trap is challenging, limiting the precise tuning of interactions between adjacent particles. This constraint hinders the study of complex interaction systems. In this work, we introduce a third nanoparticle as a coupler to two initially non-interacting nanoparticles, achieving tunable dipole-dipole coupling mediated by the third one. We investigated the effect of the particles' phases and positions on the interaction strength and demonstrated its broad tunability. Our method allows for precise control of interactions between any pair of adjacent particles in multi-particle systems, facilitating the further use of levitated nanoparticle arrays in entanglement research and sensing.</description>

      <title>Passive Time-Varying Waveform-Selective Metasurfaces for Attainment of Magnetic Property Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present circuit-loaded metasurfaces that behave differently in a passive manner even at the same frequency in accordance with the incoming waveform, specifically, its pulse width. Importantly, the time-varying waveform-selective metasurfaces reported thus far were mostly able to change their electric properties but not their magnetic properties; this severely limited the design range of their corresponding wave impedances and refractive indices and thus hindered the development of potential applications in antennas, sensors, imagers, signal processing, and wireless communications. In this study, passive time-varying waveform-selective metasurfaces were found to attain magnetic property control by introducing an additional circuit-loaded layer that generated an artificial magnetic dipole moment; this magnetic moment only occurred during the designed pulse duration in the time domain. Our proposed concept and structures were validated numerically and experimentally; thus, our results could be used to address electromagnetic and related issues sharing the same frequency component via the variation of the pulse width as an additional degree of freedom.</description>

Abstract: Analytical contact mechanics theories depend on surface roughness through the surface roughness power spectrum. In the present study, we evaluated the usability of various experimental methods for studying surface roughness. Our findings indicated that height data obtained from optical methods often lack accuracy and should not be utilized for calculating surface roughness power spectra. Conversely, engineering stylus instruments and atomic force microscopy (AFM) typically yield reliable results that are consistent across the overlapping roughness length scale region. For surfaces with isotropic roughness, the two-dimensional (2D) power spectrum can be derived from the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum using several approaches, which we explored in this paper.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of relativistic field-derivative torque in nonlinear THz response of magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the complete light-spin interactions in magnetic systems is the key to manipulating the magnetization using optical means at ultrafast timescales. The selective addressing of spins by terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields via Zeeman torque is, by far, one of the most successful ultrafast means of controlling magnetic excitations. Here we show that this traditional Zeeman torque on the spins is not sufficient, rather an additional relativistic field-derivative torque is essential to realize the observed magnetization dynamics. We accomplish this by exploring the ultrafast nonlinear magnetization dynamics of rare-earth, Bi-doped iron garnet when excited by two co-propagating THz pulses. By non-thermal optical pump-probe technique, we, first, find the collective exchange resonance mode between rare-earth and transition metal sublattices at 0.48 THz. We further explore the magnetization dynamics via a rather direct and efficient THz time-domain spectroscopic means. We find that the observed nonlinear trace of the magnetic response cannot be mapped to the magnetization precession induced by the Zeeman torque, while the Zeeman torque supplemented by an additional field-derivative torque follows the experimental evidences. This breakthrough not only enhances our comprehension of ultra-relativistic effects but also paves the way for the development of novel technologies harnessing light-induced control over magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Emission Spectrum of Doped Graphene Quantum Dots: A high-throughput TDDFT Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of fluorescence emission energies for 284 distinct graphene quantum dots (GQDs) of varying shapes (square, hexagonal, and amorphous) and sizes ($\sim$1-2 nm). These GQDs are doped with one or two elements from B, N, O, S, and P at dopant percentages of 1.5%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Our study systematically investigates the trends and patterns in emission energies as a function of shape, size, dopant type and dopant percentage. Twelve structures are identified to have emission wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The emission energies derived from our calculations can guide the formulation of specific GQD mixtures to achieve desired emission spectra within and beyond the visible range for industrial applications. Furthermore, the extensive dataset, including emission energies along with molecular structures generated in this work, creates a DFT dateset for further machine learning studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.</description>

      <title>Boosting the quality factor of Tamm structures to millions by quantum inspired classical annealer with factorization machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tamm structures show high quality (Q) factor property with simple photonic Bragg reflectors composed of alternative high/low refractive index layers and metal reflectors. However, the Q-factor of Tamm structures is inherently limited by the periodic constraints and fixed thicknesses of the Bragg reflector pairs. Removing periodic constraints and adopting aperiodic designs can lead to significantly higher Q-factors. Nevertheless, to fully exploit the potential of Tamm structures, it is essential to thoroughly explore the extensive search space introduced by these aperiodic designs. Herein, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the quantum-inspired classical annealer combined with a factorization machine to facilitate the design of photonic Bragg reflectors with the aim of achieving ultrahigh Q-factor properties. Our investigation begins by establishing the effectiveness of global optimization in a 15-bit problem setting, showcasing a remarkable efficiency improvement of nearly one order of magnitude compared to random search strategies. Subsequently, we expand our analysis to a 20-bit problem, demonstrating comparable efficiency to state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods. Moreover, the proposed method proves its capability in handling extremely large search spaces, exemplified by a 40-bit problem, where we successfully uncover a Tamm structure design exhibiting an extraordinary ultrahigh Q-factor surpassing millions. The designed aperiodic Tamm structure exhibits exceptional high localization and enhancement of electric field, and the power loss is concentrated in the low loss dielectric layer. Hence, the decay rate of power dissipation significantly decreases and light-matter interaction time increases, resulting in ultrahigh Q-factor.</description>

      <title>Drone based superconducting single photon detection system with detection efficiency more than 90%</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bounded by the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) of conventional superconducting single photon detectors (SSPD), applications of SSPDs were commonly confined in the laboratory. However, booming demands for high efficiency single photon detector incorporated with avionic platforms arise with the development of remote imaging and sensing or long-haul quantum communication without topographical constraints. We herein designed and manufactured the first drone based SSPD system with a SDE as high as 91.8%. This drone based SSPD system is established with high performance NbTiN SSPDs, self-developed miniature liquid helium dewar, and homemade integrated electric setups, which is able to be launched in complex topographical conditions. Such a drone based SSPD system may open the use of SSPDs for applications that demand high-SDE in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Optical RISs Improve the Secret Key Rate of Free-Space QKD in HAP-to-UAV Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) are proposed for employment on building rooftops to facilitate free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) between high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and low-altitude platforms (LAPs). Due to practical constraints, the communication terminals can only be positioned beneath the LAPs, preventing direct upward links to HAPs. By deploying ORISs on rooftops to reflect the beam arriving from HAPs towards LAPs from below, reliable HAP-to-LAP links can be established. To accurately characterize the optical beam propagation, we develop an analytical channel model based on extended Huygens-Fresnel principles for representing both the atmospheric turbulence effects and the hovering fluctuations of LAPs. This model facilitates adaptive ORIS beam-width control through linear, quadratic, and focusing phase shifts, which are capable of effectively mitigating the detrimental effects of beam broadening and pointing errors (PE). Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the information-theoretic bound of the QKD secret key rate (SKR) of the HAP-to-LAP links. Our findings demonstrate that quadratic phase shifts enhance the SKR at high HAP-ORIS zenith angles or mild PE conditions by narrowing the beam to optimal sizes. By contrast, linear phase shifts are advantageous at low HAP-ORIS zenith angles under moderate-to-high PE by diverging the beam to mitigate LAP fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of nanoscale matter has the potential to revolutionize a variety of fields across nanoscience and technology. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and characterize numerically a device that combines the benefits of dielectrophoresis (DEP) - long-range and strong trapping forces - with those of plasmonic tweezers - high sensitivities - to achieve a remarkable efficiency in the trapping and sensing of metallic nanoparticles and biomolecules. In particular, we show the DEP trapping and surface enhanced Raman scattering characterization of bovine serum albumin and Rhodamine B, thus extending the applications of tweezing devices to molecules having masses of only a few hundreds of Da. This range covers virtually any molecule relevant for life, from tiny oligopeptides to large proteins. This pushes our manipulation capabilities deep into the realms of efficient single-molecule biosensing and quantum science, providing a powerful platform to probe matter at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Generative Inverse Design of Metamaterials with Functional Responses by Interpretable Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metamaterials with functional responses, such as wave-based responses or deformation-induced property variation under external stimuli, can exhibit varying properties or functionalities under different conditions. Herein, we aim at rapid inverse design of these metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors. This inverse problem is challenging due to its intractability and the existence of non-unique solutions. Past works mainly focus on deep-learning-based methods that are data-demanding, require time-consuming training and hyperparameter tuning, and are non-interpretable. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Random-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), an iteration-free, single-shot inverse design method to achieve the fast generation of metamaterial designs with on-demand functional behaviors. Unlike most existing methods, by exploiting the interpretability of the random forest, we eliminate the need to train an inverse model mapping responses to designs. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained forward model, one can sample design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The RIGID method therefore functions as a generative model that captures the conditional distribution of satisfying solutions given a design target. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RIGID on both acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems where only small datasets (less than 250 training samples) are available. Synthetic design problems are created to further illustrate and validate the mechanism of likelihood estimation in RIGID. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design and eliminating its large data requirement.</description>

      <title>Efficient multiphoton microscopy with picosecond laser pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiphoton microscopes employ femtosecond lasers as light sources because the high peak power of the ultrashort pulse allows for multiphoton excitation of fluorescence in the examined sample. However, such short pulses are susceptible to broadening in a microscope's highly dispersive optical elements and require careful dispersion management, otherwise decreasing excitation efficiency. Here, we have developed a 10 nJ Yb:fiber picosecond laser with an integrated pulse picker unit and evaluated its performance in multiphoton microscopy. Our results show that performance comparable to femtosecond pulses can be obtained with picosecond pulses only by reducing the pulse repetition rate and that such pulses are significantly less prone to the effect of chromatic dispersion. These findings proved that the temporal compression of fiber lasers is not always efficient, and it can be omitted by using a smaller and easier-to-use all-fiber setup.

      <description>arXiv:2402.13348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distributed Kerr-lens mode locking regime can be realized in a waveguide laser by spatial profiling of the pump beam, thus creating a spatio-temporal soliton. Additional slow temporal modulation of the pump source stabilizes the spatio-temporal solution in a broad range of parameters, which are defined by the dynamic gain saturation. We choose a Cr:ZnS waveguide laser as a practical example, but such a regime is feasible in various waveguide and fiber oscillators. A far-reaching analogy with Bose-Einstein condensates allows using this approach to stabilization of the weakly dissipative BECs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a 2D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method for modeling a space-time modulated guidestar targeting wavefront shaping applications in disordered media. Space-time modulation in general (a particular example being the acousto-optic effect) is used here as a guidestar for the transverse confinement of light around the tagged region surrounded by disorder. Together with the guidestar, the iterative optical phase conjugation (IOPC) method is used to overcome the diffusion of light due to multiple scattering. A phase sensitive lock-in detection technique is utilized to estimate the steady-state amplitude and phase of the modulated wavefronts emerging from the guidestar region continuously operating in the Raman-Nath regime. As the IOPC scheme naturally converges to the maximally transmitting eigenchannel profile, one could use the position of the guidestar within the disorder to channelize the maximal transmission through the tagged region. The associated code developed in MATLAB is provided as an open source (MIT license) package. The code package is referred by the acronym STAR-FDTD where STAR stands for Space-Time modulated Acousto-optic guidestaR.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a simple system for dual-comb spectroscopy based on two inherently coherent optical frequency combs generated via seeded parametric down-conversion. The inbuilt coherence is established by making the two combs share a common comb line. We show that the inbuilt coherence makes it possible to use a simple numerical post-processing procedure to compensate for small drifts of the dual-comb interferogram arrival-time and phase. This enables long-time coherent averaging of the interferograms.</description>

Abstract: It has been shown numerically that coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations describing the interaction between the left and right circular polarizations of a paraxial optical wave in a defocusing Kerr medium with an anomalous dispersion in a helical waveguide have stable solutions in the form of elongated stationary rotating bubbles with several optical vortices attached to the ends. A bubble is an arbitrarily long quasi-cylindrical three-dimensional cavity in one of the components filled with the opposite component. The transverse profile of the bubble is determined by the shape of the cross section of the waveguide, the helix pitch, the number of vortices, and the background intensity of the surrounding component rather than by the total amount of the filling component.

Abstract: Miniaturized spectrometers hold great promise for in situ, in vitro, and even in vivo sensing applications. However, their size reduction imposes vital performance constraints in meeting the rigorous demands of spectroscopy, including fine resolution, high accuracy, and ultra-wide observation window. The prevailing view in the community holds that miniaturized spectrometers are most suitable for the coarse identification of signature peaks. In this paper, we present an integrated reconstructive spectrometer that enables near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic metrology, and demonstrate a fully packaged sensor with auxiliary electronics. Such a sensor operates over a 520 nm bandwidth together with a resolution of less than 8 pm, which translates into a record-breaking bandwidth-to-resolution ratio of over 65,000. The classification of different types of solid substances and the concentration measurement of aqueous and organic solutions are performed, all achieving approximately 100% accuracy. Notably, the detection limit of our sensor matches that of the commercial benchtop counterparts, which is as low as 0.1% (i.e. 100 mg/dL) for identifying the concentration of glucose solution.</description>

      <title>Controlling Markovianity with Chiral Giant Atoms</title>

Abstract: Giant artificial atoms are promising and flexible building blocks for the implementation of analog quantum simulators. They are realized via a multi-local pattern of couplings of two-level systems to a waveguide, or to a two-dimensional photonic bath. A hallmark of giant-atom physics is their non-Markovian character in the form of self-coherent feedback, leading, e.g., to non-exponential atomic decay. The timescale of their non-Markovianity is essentially given by the time delay proportional to the distance between the various coupling points. In parallel, with the state-of-the-art experimental setups, it is possible to engineer complex phases in the atom-light couplings. Such phases simulate an artificial magnetic field, yielding a chiral behavior of the atom-light system. Here, we report a surprising connection between these two seemingly unrelated features of giant atoms, showing that the chirality of a giant atom controls its Markovianity. In particular, by adjusting the couplings' phases, a giant atom can, counterintuitively, enter an exact Markovian regime irrespectively of any inherent time delay. We illustrate this mechanism as an interference process and via a collision model picture. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of giant atom physics, and open new avenues for the control of quantum nanophotonic networks.</description>

Abstract: Phase recovery, calculating the phase of a light wave from its intensity measurements, is essential for various applications, such as coherent diffraction imaging, adaptive optics, and biomedical imaging. It enables the reconstruction of an object's refractive index distribution or topography as well as the correction of imaging system aberrations. In recent years, deep learning has been proven to be highly effective in addressing phase recovery problems. Two most direct deep learning phase recovery strategies are data-driven (DD) with supervised learning mode and physics-driven (PD) with self-supervised learning mode. DD and PD achieve the same goal in different ways and lack the necessary study to reveal similarities and differences. Therefore, in this paper, we comprehensively compare these two deep learning phase recovery strategies in terms of time consumption, accuracy, generalization ability, ill-posedness adaptability, and prior capacity. What's more, we propose a co-driven (CD) strategy of combining datasets and physics for the balance of high- and low-frequency information. The codes for DD, PD, and CD are publicly available at https://github.com/kqwang/DLPR.</description>
