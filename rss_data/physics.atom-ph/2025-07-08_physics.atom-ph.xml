      <title>Compact and robust design of the optical system for cold atom interferometer in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical system is a complex and precise subsystem for the atom interferometer (AI), especially for those used in field or space applications. Here, we introduce the design of the optical system of the China Space Station atom interferometer (CSSAI). The scheme is optimized to reduce the complexity while maintaining the capability to achieve the dual-species AI. It features a fused silica optical bench with bonding technology, ensuring compactness and smaller thermal deformation. Spatial structures are designed to isolate the vibration and transfer the heat. After assembling, the optical system has a size of 250 mm * 240 mm * 104 mm and weighs 5.2 kg. After installing in the CSSAI, it passed the thermal and mechanical tests and then launched to the China Space Station (CSS). The output laser power changes are less than 15% from ground to space, and its long-term fluctuations are less than 2.5% for months in space. Cold atom preparation and interference are also realized in space. This optical system is extremely integrated and robust, which provides a foundation for the design of future cold atom payloads in space.</description>

      <title>Probing coherent electronic superpositions of singly- and doubly-excited states of krypton with attosecond four-wave mixing spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative nonlinear four-wave mixing can monitor the evolution of electronic wave packets, providing access to lifetimes and quantifies the light induced couplings between excited states. We report the observation of quantum beats in an autoionizing electronic wavepacket in krypton, probed using this technique. Analysis of the signal reveals that these beats originate from the contribution of previously unassigned, doubly excited states interacting with singly excited ones. We introduce a minimal theoretical model, based on multichannel quantum defect theory, that quantitatively reproduces both the wavepacket dynamics and the static spectrum. This work combines a versatile, background-free experimental scheme with a tractable model, establishing a powerful approach for the metrology and control of complex, correlated electronic states.</description>

      <title>Water evaporation-driven dynamic diode for direct electricity generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing energy from ubiquitous water resources via molecular-scale mechanisms remains a critical frontier in sustainable energy research. Herein, we present a novel evaporation-driven power generator based on a dynamic diode architecture that continuously harvests direct current (DC) electricity by leveraging the flipping of the strong built-in electric field (up to 10E10 V/cm) generated by polar molecules such as water to drive directional carrier migration. In our system, water molecules undergo sequential polarization and depolarization at the graphene-water-silicon interface, triggering cycles of charge trapping and release. This nonionic mechanism is driven primarily by the Fermi level difference between graphene and silicon, augmented by the intrinsic dipole moment of water molecules. Structural optimization using graphene enhances evaporation kinetics and interfacial contact, yielding an open-circuit voltage of 0.35 V from a 2 cm * 1 cm device. When four units are connected in series, the system delivers a stable 1.2V output. Unlike ion-mediated energy harvesters, this corrosion-free architecture ensures long-term stability and material compatibility. Our work introduces a fundamentally new approach to water-based power generation, establishing interfacial polarization engineering as a scalable strategy for low-cost, sustainable electricity production from ambient water.</description>

      <title>A general approximator for strong-field ionization rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to retrieve sub-optical-cycle dynamics of strong-field ionization from ionization probabilities obtained for a set of few-cycle laser pulses that covers a sufficiently broad parameter space. To this end, we introduce a General Approximator for Strong-Field Ionization Rates (GASFIR). Unlike existing analytical models of multiphoton ionization, GASFIR is a retrieval tool. It has a few adjustable parameters that provide the flexibility required to accurately reconstruct ab initio data. At the same time, GASFIR imposes only the most essential constraints on ionization rates, which makes it suitable for time-domain investigations of complex quantum phenomena that influence strong-field ionization. We benchmark GASFIR for atomic hydrogen. By examining the quasistatic limit of GASFIR, we demonstrate its relationship to well-established theories of tunneling ionization and show that it accurately reproduces published quasistatic rates for tunneling ionization.</description>

      <title>Orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transform minima in molecular ionization probabilities into maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper, we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, we find that in CH$_3$Br, the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to a local maximum as the ionizing field strength increases. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction (OE-WFAT(1)) in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <title>Imaging atomic scattering potential in centroidal diffraction of elastic electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fraunhofer diffraction of quantum particles from materials with sharp electron-density edges or symmetric bond structures is ubiquitous. In contrast, diffraction from atoms with characteristic asymptotically-diffused electron distribution is far less intuitive, although known for many years. The current study unravels an unusual diffraction mechanism of elastic electrons from diffused atomic diffractors. Consequently, the fringe pattern converted to the Fourier reciprocal space maps out the effective scattering potential, which is not accessible in direct measurements. This may benefit benchmarking theory models, advances in atom-holography, plasma and astrophysical diagnostics, and accessing time-resolved potential landscapes. The study employs relativistic partial wave analysis with atoms modeled in the Dirac-Fock formalism and performs e-Cd measurements in absolute scale. Analysis for Mg, Ba, and Ra targets demonstrates the universality of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Magic wavelength at 477 nm for the strontium clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental measurement of a magic wavelength at 476.82362(8) nm for the 88Sr clock transition. The magic wavelength is determined through AC-Stark shift spectroscopy of atoms in an optical dipole trap. The value slightly deviates from the theoretical prediction by 0.061(54) nm. This magic wavelength, being shorter than the common one at 813 nm, will be important for applications such as Bragg pulses for matter-wave interferometry involving both clock states. This work also paves the way for quantum simulation with a shorter lattice.</description>

      <title>Dual frequency calibration to build a portable vapor cell optical clock with improved stability and without a frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article theoretically proposes a new dual interferometer technique to accurately calibrate two laser frequencies simultaneously using four-wave mixing in an alkali metal vapor cell. The two frequency-calibrated lasers are mixed to create a beat signal at radio frequency to build a portable optical atomic clock (OAC) without an optical frequency comb (OFC). Removal of the OFC improves the portability of OAC, while the dual interferometer setup enhances the one second stability to $1.3\times 10^{-15}$, which is better than the current portable OAC. Thermal noise in the OAC is minimized by choosing the double-lambda atomic scheme with co-propagating laser fields. Using D2 transition of Rb-87, the standard quantum limited frequency sensitivity and stability of the OAC are estimated as $3.2\;\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$, and $1.3\times10^{-15}\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}^{-1}}$, respectively. After considering broadening effects due to $357\,$K temperature and collisions, the optimum stability of the OAC is reduced to $3.3\times10^{-15}\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}^{-1}}$ for a laser with $1\,$KHz linewidth and $0.54$ mW power at the input of the vapor cell.</description>

      <title>Electronic Bridge processes in $^{229}$Th-doped LiCAF and LiSAF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic bridge mechanisms driving the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in the vacuum-ultraviolet-transparent crystals $^{229}$Th:LiCAF (LiCaAlF$_6$) and $^{229}$Th:LiSAF (LiSrAlF$_6$) are investigated theoretically. Due to doping-induced symmetry breaking within the host crystal, electronic defect states emerge around the thorium nucleus and can facilitate nuclear (de)excitation via laser-assisted electronic bridge mechanisms. We investigate spontaneous and laser-assisted electronic bridge schemes for different charge compensation mechanisms. While the calculated spontaneous electronic bridge rates are very small, laser-assisted electronic bridge schemes for nuclear (de)excitation turn out to be significantly more efficient than both spontaneous nuclear decay and direct laser excitation, offering promising prospects for the future clock operation.</description>

      <title>Laser spectroscopy and CP-violation sensitivity of actinium monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent invariance of the strong nuclear force under combined charge conjugation and parity (CP) remains an open question in modern physics. Precision experiments with heavy atoms and molecules can provide stringent constraints on CP violation via searches for effects due to permanent electric dipole moments and other CP-odd properties in leptons, hadrons, and nuclei. Radioactive molecules have been proposed as highly sensitive probes for such searches, but experiments with most such molecules have so far been beyond technical reach. Here we report the first production and spectroscopic study of a gas-phase actinium molecule, $^{227}$AcF. We observe the predicted strongest electronic transition from the ground state, which is necessary for efficient readout in searches of symmetry-violating interactions. Furthermore, we perform electronic- and nuclear-structure calculations for $^{227}$AcF to determine its sensitivity to various CP-violating parameters, and find that a realistic, near-term experiment with a precision of 1 mHz would improve current constraints on the CP-violating parameter hyperspace by three orders of magnitude. Our results thus highlight the potential of $^{227}$AcF for exceptionally sensitive searches of CP violation.</description>

      <title>Optical cycling of MgF molecules within the hyperfine states in X(N=1) state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the optical cycling effect of the $\mathrm{X}^2\Sigma(v=0,\ N=1^-) - \mathrm{A}^2\Pi_{1/2}(v'=0,\ J'=1/2^+)$ band of MgF molecules, specifically the $\mathrm{P_1/Q_{12}(1)}$ transition, which serves as the main transition in the quasi-closed cycling scheme for the laser cooling. A higher number of scattered photons was observed when all three frequency components of the $\mathrm{P_1/Q_{12}(1)}$ transition were simultaneously applied using acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). Optimal conditions were identified by scanning the detuning of frequency components, the laser beam power ratio, and the total laser beam power, and the results were confirmed through rate equation simulations. Under these optimized conditions, and with an applied magnetic field, the scattering rate was enhanced by approximately a factor of six. These results refine the implementation of optical cycling in MgF and lay the groundwork for laser slowing and magneto-optical trapping (MOT) experiments.</description>

      <title>Effective anisotropic interaction potentials for pairs of ultracold molecules shielded by a static electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gases of ultracold polar molecules have novel properties because of the strong dipolar forces between molecules. Current experiments shield the molecules from destructive collisions by engineering long-range repulsive interactions using microwave or static electric fields. These shielding methods produce interaction potentials with large repulsive cores that are not well described with contact potentials. In this paper we explore the anisotropic interaction potentials that arise for pairs of polar molecules shielded with static electric fields. We derive computationally inexpensive approximations for the potentials that are suitable for use in calculations of many-body properties. The interaction potentials for molecules shielded with static fields are qualitatively different from those that arise from single-field microwave shielding and will produce quite different many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Shaping Cold Atom Clouds with a Vortex Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for shaping a cold atom cloud using a vortex laser beam with a polarisation singularity at its center, which creates a point of vanishing intensity. Exploiting this feature we experimentally demonstrate two different schemes to create micron-scaled line- and sheet-like atomic density distributions. In the dynamic scheme, atoms in the bright beam regions are accelerated and therefore effectively removed from the cloud. In the dark-state scheme, these atoms are pumped into a state that does not interact with the shaping light. In both cases, an atomic distribution remains, either as a thin line or as a sheet when an additional polarizer is used. We find good agreement between the experimental results and our theoretical model, which predicts the method to be in principle not diffraction-limited.</description>

      <title>Compact detector for atom-atom correlations on an atom chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a compact, ionization-based detector for the state-selective and spatially resolved measurement of individual Rydberg atoms trapped in the vicinity of an atom chip. The system combines an electrostatic lens system for guiding charged particles with an array of channel electron multipliers (CEMs) capable of detecting both ions and electrons produced by ionization. Designed for quantum information applications, this device enables the detection of correlations between spatially separated Rydberg qubits. Additionally, the electrodes provide compensation for stray electric fields and control over particle trajectories. The imaging system achieves a total magnification of more than 12, with a single-axis magnification up to 200, while maintaining low aberrations. We characterize the performance of the system using a charged particle trajectory simulation software and discuss how a coincidence measurement of ions and electrons can be used to calibrate the detection efficiency. This detector enables high-fidelity measurement of multiple Rydberg atoms and is well-suited for applications in cavity-mediated quantum gates.</description>

Abstract: Quantum correlated states of light, such as squeezed states, are a fundamental resource for the development of quantum technologies, as they are needed for applications in quantum metrology, quantum computation, and quantum communications. It is thus critical to develop compact, efficient, and robust sources to generate such states. Here we report on a compact, narrowband, fiber-coupled source of two-mode squeezed states of light at 795 nm based on four wave mixing (FWM) in a $^{85}$Rb atomic vapor. The source is designed in a small modular form factor, with two input fiber-coupled beams, the seed and pump beams required for the FWM, and two output fibers, one for each of the modes of the squeezed state. The system is optimized for low pump power (135 mW) to achieve a maximum intensity-difference squeezing of 4.4 dB after the output fibers at an analysis frequency of 1 MHz. The narrowband nature of the source makes it ideal for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking configurations that rely on atomic quantum memories. Such a source paves the way for a versatile and portable platform for applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry with cavity QED-based single-photon sources: A Quantum Jump Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum jump/trajectory analysis of the two-photon interference phenomenon in the context of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect (HOME). In particular, we consider the standard setup of HOME, which consists of two-photon sources firing single photons from the opposite sides of a 50/50 beam splitter and two perfect detectors placed at the output ports to record photodetection events. For single-photon sources, we consider two special cases: (1) two excited two-level atoms and (2) two atom-cavity setups with initially present single photons in both cavities. For both cases, we report analytic results as well as quantum jump-based Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the signatures of these single-photon sources on the HOME under different working conditions (for example, strong- and weak-coupling regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics). Our results may have interesting applications in linear optics quantum computing as well as in protocols that test the indistinguishability of single-photon sources.</description>

      <title>Temporally-long C-band heralded single photons generated from hot atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: C-band photons are recognized for having the lowest loss coefficient in optical fibers, making them highly favorable for optical fiber-based communication. In this study, we systematically investigated the temporal width of C-band heralded single photons and developed a theoretical model for biphoton generation via the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process using a diamond-type transition scheme, which has not been previously reported. Our experimental data on temporal width closely aligns with the predictions of this model. Additionally, we introduced a new concept: the atomic velocity group relating to the two-photon resonance condition and the one-photon detuning in this atomic frame. These two parameters are crucial for understanding the behavior of the biphoton source. The concept indicates that the hot-atom source behaves similarly to the cold-atom source. Guided by our theoretical model, we observed 1529-nm (C-band) heralded single photons with a temporal width of 28.3$\pm$0.6 ns, corresponding to a linewidth of 11.0$\pm$0.2 MHz. For comparison, the ultimate linewidth limit is 6.1 MHz, determined by the natural linewidth of the atoms. Among all atom-based sources of 1300 to 1550 nm heralded single photons utilizing either cold or hot atoms, the temporal width achieved in this work represents the first instance of a width exceeding 10 ns, making it (or its linewidth) the longest (or narrowest) record to date. This work significantly enhances our understanding of diamond-type or cascade-type SFWM biphoton generation and marks an important milestone in achieving greater temporal width in atom-based sources of C-band heralded single photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes review recent progress in studying the Fermi-Hubbard model using ultracold gases in optical lattices. We focus on results from quantum gas microscope experiments that have allowed site-resolved measurements of charge and spin correlations in half-filled and doped Hubbard systems, as well as direct imaging of various types of polaronic quasiparticles. We also review experiments exploring dynamical properties of the Hubbard model through transport and spectroscopy. Moving beyond the plain-vanilla square-lattice Hubbard model, we present more recent work exploring Hubbard systems with novel lattice geometries and long-range interactions that stabilize new phases. Finally, we discuss the realization of entropy distribution protocols to cool these systems to ultralow temperatures where comparison to unbiased numerics is no longer possible.</description>

      <title>From Wavefunctional Entanglement to Entangled Wavefunctional Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of whether entanglement between photons is equivalent to entanglement between their characteristic field modes, specifically, the single-particle wavefunctions that are composed and superposed to describe identical particles, is a key, open problem concerning multi-partite optical degrees of freedom, and has profound implications for topics ranging from quantum foundations to quantum computation. In this Letter, I offer a fresh, deeper, physical insight into this subtle, albeit enduring, issue by describing a situation in which entangling interactions between optical modes, namely, the wavefunctions can be distilled into genuine entanglement between the physical properties of the photons, which are the wavefunctional degrees of freedom. This theoretical observation also highlights the salience of the measurement context, especially, of clearly disambiguating between the choice of the quantum subsystem and the decision to measure an observable along a particular axis of measurement, while quantifying and transforming quantum optical entanglement. This understanding might be applied to formulate a new class of protocols for distilling quantum magic from contextually and nonlocally entangled photons within inseparable field modes.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Correlation Trends in the Electric Dipole Polarizabilities of Many Low-lying States in Cs I through First-principle Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron correlation and higher-order relativistic effects are probed in the evaluation of scalar and tensor static electric dipole (E1) polarizabilities ($\alpha_d$) of several even- and odd-parity states in cesium (Cs) using the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method, second-order perturbation theory (MBPT(2)), third-order perturbation theory (MBPT(3)), random phase approximation (RPA), and singles and doubles approximated relativistic coupled-cluster (RCCSD) method. To account for perturbation due to odd-parity E1 operator on the atomic orbitals, calculations are carried out in the linear response approach. Our final $\alpha_d$ values, with the estimated uncertainties, show reasonably good agreement with the previous calculations and available experimental results. Differences among the DHF, MBPT(2), MBPT(3) and RPA results indicate pair-correlation (PC) effects play major roles than the core-polarization (CP) effects in the determination of $\alpha_d$ values in Cs. From the differences among the MBPT(3) and RCC results, we find correlations among the PC and CP effects and double CP effects together are also significant in these calculations. Contributions from the Breit interactions are found to be quite large in the high-lying states.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dress-State Engineered Rydberg Electrometry: Achieving 100-MHz-level Instantaneous-Bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10541v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms, with their giant electric dipole moments and tunable energy-level transitions, offer exceptional potential for microwave (MW) electric field sensing, combining high sensitivity and broad frequency coverage. However, simultaneously achieving high sensitivity and wide instantaneous bandwidth in a Rydberg-based MW transducer remains a critical challenge. Here, we propose a multi-dress-state engineered superheterodyne detection scheme for Rydberg electrometry that exploits a detuning-dependent dual-peak response structure and a Rabi-frequency-driven dip-lifting effect to overcome the limitation on instantaneous bandwidth. By strategically engineering the multiple dress states of Rydberg atoms, we demonstrate a thermal $\mathrm{^{87}Rb}$ vapor-based transducer with a record sensitivity of $\mathrm{140.4\,nV\,cm^{-1}\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ and an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 54.6$\,$MHz. The performance metrics are now approaching the practical requirements of modern MW receivers (100-MHz-level) in certain application fields. This advancement bridges the gap between atomic sensing and real-world applications, paving the way for Rydberg-atom technologies in radar,wireless communication, and spectrum monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optical technique for suppressing relaxation in alkali-metal spins using a single off-resonant laser beam. The method harnesses a physical mechanism that synchronizes Larmor precession in the two hyperfine manifolds, protecting magnetic coherence from relaxation caused by spin-exchange and other hyperfine-changing collisions. We experimentally demonstrate up to a ninefold reduction in decoherence of warm cesium vapor, achieving simultaneous protection from both spin-exchange relaxation and partial depolarization from coated cell walls. The technique substantially enhances the spin precession quality factor and maintains a stable gyromagnetic ratio independent of spin polarization, even under frequent collisions. These findings offer a pathway for mitigating dominant relaxation channels in alkali-metal-based applications and experiments, particularly in anti-relaxation-coated cells.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Charge and Exciton Transfer in Multi-mode Models using Engineered Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</description>

      <title>Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates with Less Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</description>
