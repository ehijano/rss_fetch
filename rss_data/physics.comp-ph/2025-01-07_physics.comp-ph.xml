      <title>High-throughput calculations of spin Hall conductivity in non-magnetic 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin Hall effect (SHE) in two-dimensional (2D) materials is promising to effectively manipulate spin angular momentum and identify topological properties. In this work, we implemented an automated Wannierization with spin-orbit coupling on 426 non-magnetic monolayers including 210 metal and 216 insulators. Intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) has been calculated to find candidates exhibiting novel properties. We discover that Y$_2$C$_2$I$_2$ has an unconventional SHE with canted spin due to low crystal symmetry, Ta$_4$Se$_2$ is a metallic monolayer with exceptionally high SHC, and the semi-metal Y$_2$Br$_2$ possesses efficient charge-to-spin conversion induced by anti-crossing in bands. Moreover, quantum spin Hall insulators are investigated for quantized SHC. The present work provides a high-quality Wannier Hamiltonian database of 2D materials, and paves the way for the integration of 2D materials into high-performance and low-power-consumption spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exact Constraint of Density Functional Approximations at the Semiclassical Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the semiclassical limit to electronic systems by taking the limit $\hbar\rightarrow 0$ in the solution of Schr\"odinger equations. We show that this limit is closely related to one type of strong correlation that is particularly challenging from conventional multi-configurational perspective but can be readily described through semiclassical analysis. Furthermore, by studying the performance of density functional approximations (DFAs) in the semiclassical limit, we find that mainstream DFAs have erroneous divergent energy behaviors as $\hbar \rightarrow 0$, violating the exact constraint of finite energy. Importantly, by making connection of the significantly underestimated DFA energies of many strongly correlated transition-metal diatomic molecules to their rather small estimated $\hbar_{\text{eff}}$, we demonstrate the usefulness of our semiclassical analysis and its promise for inspiring better DFAs.</description>

      <title>Adaptive GSIS for rarefied gas flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parallel solver of the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), as recently developed by Zhang \textit{et. al.} in Comput. Fluids 281 (2024) 106374, is an efficient method to find the solution of the Boltzmann equation deterministically. However, it consumes a significant computational memory due to the discretization of molecular velocity space in hypersonic flows. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the adaptive GSIS, where the Boltzmann equation is applied only in rarefied regions when the local Knudsen number exceeds a reference value, $\text{Kn}{ref}$. In contrast, the Navier-Stokes equations, with and without the high-order corrections to the constitutive relations, are applied in the continuum and rarefied regimes, respectively. Numerical results indicate that setting $\text{Kn}{ref}=0.01$ yields acceptable outcomes. With the adaptive GSIS, the computational memory and time can be significantly reduced in near-continuum flows, e.g. 24 and 7 times, respectively. in the simulation of rarefied gas flow passing the International Space Station.</description>

      <title>Accurate calculation of bubble and droplet properties in diffuse-interface two-phase simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of accurately calculating droplet/bubble properties (e.g., volume, number) in diffuse-interface two-phase flow simulations. Currently, flood-fill algorithms can truncate a significant portion of the volume of droplets/bubbles contained within the diffuse interface region or artificially merge multiple droplets/bubbles. This error is also dependent on the volume fraction cutoff value, which is typically chosen to be 0.5 arbitrarily, in the flood-fill algorithms. We propose a simple volume-correction approach that incorporates an analytical approximation of the truncated volume to correct for the missing droplet/bubble volumes. This proposed method results in accurately recovering the dispersed phase volumes with minimal volume error over a wide range of volume fraction cutoff values; and hence, can also accurately recover the number of droplets/bubbles. This can be a valuable tool for accurate calculation of drop/bubble size distributions for analysis and for Eulerian-to-Lagrangian conversion of the dispersed phase in multi-scale modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Actuation mechanisms in twisted and coiled polymer actuators using finite element model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted and coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) offer the advantages of large stroke and large specific work as compared to other actuators. There have been extensive experimental investigations towards understanding their actuation response, however, a computational model with full material description is not utilized to probe into the underlying mechanisms responsible for their large actuation. In this work, we develop a three-dimensional finite element model that includes the physics of the fabrication process to simulate the actuation of TCPA under various loading and boundary conditions. The model is validated against the experimental data and used to explore the factors responsible for actuation under free and isobaric conditions. The model captures the physics of the angle of twist in the fiber and the distinction between the homochiral and heterochiral nature of TCPA actuation response. The simulations show that the anisotropy in the thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) matrix plays a major role in large actuation irrespective of the anisotropy or isotropy in the elasticity tensor. We further investigate the extent of anisotropy in thermal expansion and the parametric studies show that the key for TCPA actuation is the absolute value of mismatch in thermal expansion even if the material has positive or negative CTE in both directions of the fiber. Furthermore, we propose a new shell-core composite-based TCPA concept by combining the epoxy and hollow Nylon tubes to suppress the creep in TCPA. The results show that the volume fraction of epoxy-core can be tuned to attain a desired actuation while offering a stiffer and creep-resistant response. This framework provides a wider application for probing various kinds of TCPAs and enhancing their actuation performance.</description>

      <title>An a-posteriori analysis of co-kurtosis PCA based dimensionality reduction using a neural ODE solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-dimensional representation of thermochemical scalars based on cokurtosis principal component analysis (CoK-PCA) has been shown to effectively capture stiff chemical dynamics in reacting flows relative to the widely used principal component analysis (PCA). The effectiveness of the reduced manifold was evaluated in a priori analyses using both linear and nonlinear reconstructions of thermochemical scalars from aggressively truncated principal components (PCs). In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of a CoK-PCA-based reduced manifold using a posteriori analysis. Simulations of spontaneous ignition in a homogeneous reactor that pose a challenge in accurately capturing the ignition delay time as well as the scalar profiles within the reaction zone are considered. The governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in the PC space were evolved from the initial conditions using two ODE solvers. First, a standard ODE solver that uses a pre-trained artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the source terms and integrates the solution in time. Second, a neural ODE solver that incorporates the time integration of PCs into the ANN training. The time-evolved profiles of the PCs and reconstructed thermochemical scalars demonstrate the robustness of the CoK-PCA-based low-dimensional manifold in accurately capturing the ignition process. Furthermore, we observed that the neural ODE solver minimized propagation errors across time steps and provided more accurate results than the standard ODE solver. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of CoK-PCA-based manifolds to be implemented in massively parallel reacting flow solvers.</description>

      <title>A feature-preserving parallel particle generation method for complex geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a Feature-preserving Particle Generation (FPPG) method for arbitrary complex geometry is proposed. Instead of basing on implicit geometries, such as level-set, FPPG employs an explicit geometric representation for the parallel and automatic generation of high-quality surface and volume particles, which enables the full preservation of geometric features, such as sharp edges, singularities and etc. Several new algorithms are proposed in this paper to achieve the aforementioned objectives. First, a particle mapping and feature line extraction algorithm is proposed to ensure the adequate representation of arbitrary complex geometry. An improved and efficient data structure is developed too to maximize the parallel efficiency and to optimize the memory footprint. Second, the physics-based particle relaxation procedure is tailored for the explicit geometric representation to achieve a uniform particle distribution. Third, in order to handle large-scale industrial models, the proposed FPPG method is entirely parallelized on shared memory systems and Boolean operations are allowed to tackle structures with multiple assemblies. Intensive numerical tests are carried out to demonstrate the capabilities of FPPG. The scalability tests show that a speedup of ~10X is achieved through multi-threading parallelization with various models. Comparative studies with other particle generation methods show that FPPG achieves better performance in both runtime and accuracy. Last, two industrial cases of vehicle wading and gearbox oiling are studied to illustrate that FPPG is applicable to complex geometries.</description>

      <title>First principles phase diagram calculation and theoretical investigation of electronic structure properties of $\mathrm{KCuTe_{1-x}Se_{x}}$ for photocathode applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-throughput studies of copper-based semiconductors have identified potassium-based copper chalcogenides, KCuA (A $\in$ Te, Se, S) as optimal light absorbers in photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical devices. In this work, we investigate the applicability of $\mathrm{KCuTe_{1-x}Se_{x}}$ as photocathode materials using first-principles calculations. The calculated temperature-composition phase diagram predicts the formation of the solid solution of $\mathrm{KCuTe_{1-x}Se_{x}}$ in the hexagonal structure beyond a maximum critical temperature of 322 K. Structure relaxation in the alloy competes with volume deformation of the parent lattice and charge exchange between (Te, Se) anions to produce a net linear variation in the bandgap with the alloy concentration. The following results suggest that this alloy is a suitable photocathode: i) lower effective mass, and hence a higher mobility of electrons in the alloy compared to the end compounds, ii) an absorption coefficient of the order of $\mathrm{10^{5}\ cm^{-1}}$, and iii) an appropriate alignment of the conduction band with respect to the hydrogen reduction reaction.</description>

      <title>Wave or Physics-Appropriate Multidimensional Upwinding Approach for Compressible Multiphase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces multidimensional algorithms for simulating multiphase flows, leveraging the wave structure of the Euler equations in characteristic space and the physical properties of variables in physical space. The algorithm applies different reconstruction schemes to acoustic, vorticity, and entropy waves in characteristic space to enhance accuracy and minimize numerical artifacts. In characteristic space, upwind schemes are used for acoustic waves, central schemes for vorticity and entropy waves, and Tangent of Hyper-bola for INterface Capturing (THINC) reconstruction for material interfaces and contact discontinuities (a subset of entropy waves). This approach prevents spurious vortices in periodic shear layers, accurately captures vortical structures in gas-gas and gas-liquid interactions, and improves the accuracy of shock-entropy wave interactions. In physical space, phasic densities are computed using THINC in regions of contact discontinuities and material interfaces, while tangential velocities are calculated with central schemes to improve vortical structures. An adaptive reconstruction technique is also introduced to mitigate oscillations near shocks, which arise from primitive variable reconstruction, by combining primitive and characteristic variable reconstructions with the liquid phase being identified using the stiffened gas parameter. The proposed multidimensional upwinding approach outperforms traditional schemes, demonstrating superior accuracy in capturing physical phenomena, reducing numerical artifacts, and better matching experimental results across complex test cases.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Cation-Polyanion Coupling in Solid Electrolytes: Which Anion Motion Dominates Cation Transport?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium and sodium solid electrolytes feature polyanion frameworks and highly mobile cations. Understanding and quantifying the impact of polyanion dynamics on cations will help us to unravel the complex role that anion play in superionic conductors. However, no experimental or computational method can directly extract this information, as polyanion dynamics are always coupled with other factors that affect ion mobility. Here, we present the pioneering study that combines constraint algorithm and machine-learning molecular dynamics to quantitatively reveal the effects of polyanion translation, rotation, and vibration on cation mobility across a diverse material class. Ultralong-time, large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations with selective constraints on each anion motion mode unequivocally yield results at near room and elevated temperatures. In sharp contrast to the previous understanding that facile anion rotation primarily facilitates cation transport, the strong coupling between anion translation and vibration with cation diffusion has been unraveled for the first time; we find that translation, rotation, and vibration can each directly drive superionicity, with one typically dominant in each class of materials. Anion rotation dominates cation transport when the rotation frequency matches the cation hopping frequency, whereas anion translation prevails at higher and vibration at lower rotation frequencies. The impact of anion dynamics on cation diffusion becomes more prominent at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Mapping Transient Structures of Cyclo[18]Carbon by Computational X-Ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of cyclo[18]carbon (C$_{18}$), whether in its polyynic form with bond length alternation (BLA) or its cumulenic form without BLA, has long fascinated researchers, even prior to its successful synthesis. Recent studies suggest a polyynic ground state and a cumulenic transient state; however, the dynamics remain unclear and lack experimental validation. This study presents a first-principles theoretical investigation of the bond lengths ($R_1$ and $R_2$) dependent two-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) of C$_{18}$, concentrating on the ground state and carbon 1s ionized and excited states. We examine the potential of X-ray spectra for determining bond lengths and monitoring transient structures, finding that both X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and absorption (XAS) spectra are sensitive to these variations. Utilizing a library of ground-state minimum structures optimized with 14 different functionals, we observe that core binding energies predicted with the $\omega$B97XD functional can vary by 0.9 eV (290.3--291.2 eV). Unlike the ground state PES, which predicts minima at alternating bond lengths, the C1s ionized state PES predicts minima with equivalent bond lengths. In the XAS spectra, peaks 1$\pi^*$ and 2$\pi^*$ show a redshift with increasing bond lengths along the line where $R_1 = R_2$. Additionally, increasing $R_2$ (with $R_1$ fixed) results in an initial redshift followed by a blueshift, minimizing at $R_1 = R_2$. Major peaks indicate that both 1$\pi^*$ and 2$\pi^*$ arise from two channels: C1s$\rightarrow\pi^*_{z}$ (out-of-plane) and C1s$\rightarrow\pi^*_{xy}$ (in-plane) transitions at coinciding energies.</description>

      <title>Carleman-lattice-Boltzmann quantum circuit with matrix access oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply Carleman linearization of the Lattice Boltzmann (CLB) representation of fluid flows to quantum emulate the dynamics of a 2D Kolmogorov-like flow. We assess the accuracy of the result and find a relative error of the order of $10^{-3}$ with just two Carleman iterates, for a range of the Reynolds number up to a few hundreds. We first define a gate-based quantum circuit for the implementation of the CLB method and then exploit the sparse nature of the CLB matrix to build a quantum circuit based on block-encoding techniques which makes use of matrix oracles. It is shown that the gate complexity of the algorithm is thereby dramatically reduced, from exponential to quadratic. However, due to the need of employing up to seven ancilla qubits, the probability of success of the corresponding circuit for a single time step is too low to enable multi-step time evolution. Several possible directions to circumvent this problem are briefly outlined.</description>

      <title>Generalized Huang's Equation for Phonon Polariton in Polyatomic Polar Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original theory of phonon polariton is Huang's equation which is suitable for diatomic polar crystals only. We proposed a generalized Huang's equation without fitting parameters for phonon polariton in polyatomic polar crystals. We obtained the dispersions of phonon polariton in GaP (bulk), hBN (bulk and 2D), {\alpha}-MoO3 (bulk and 2D) and ZnTeMoO6 (2D), which agree with the experimental results in the literature and of ourselves. We also obtained the eigenstates of the phonon polariton. We found that the circular polarization of the ion vibration component of these eigenstates is nonzero in hBN flakes. The result is different from that of the phonon in hBN.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach for Discovering Time- Delayed Differential Equation from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-delayed differential equations (TDDEs) are widely used to model complex dynamic systems where future states depend on past states with a delay. However, inferring the underlying TDDEs from observed data remains a challenging problem due to the inherent nonlinearity, uncertainty, and noise in real-world systems. Conventional equation discovery methods often exhibit limitations when dealing with large time delays, relying on deterministic techniques or optimization-based approaches that may struggle with scalability and robustness. In this paper, we present BayTiDe - Bayesian Approach for Discovering Time-Delayed Differential Equations from Data, that is capable of identifying arbitrarily large values of time delay to an accuracy that is directly proportional to the resolution of the data input to it. BayTiDe leverages Bayesian inference combined with a sparsity-promoting discontinuous spike-and-slab prior to accurately identify time-delayed differential equations. The approach accommodates arbitrarily large time delays with accuracy proportional to the input data resolution, while efficiently narrowing the search space to achieve significant computational savings. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of BayTiDe through a range of numerical examples, validating its ability to recover delayed differential equations from noisy data.</description>

      <title>Rectangular finite elements for modeling the mechanical behavior of auxetic materials</title>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the exploration of rectangular finite elements' ability to model the stress-strain state of isotropic and orthotropic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, known as auxetic materials. By employing linear elasticity in the plane stress formulation, the research evaluates the linear compatible and the quadratic incompatible shape functions in describing the mechanical behavior of auxetic materials within a displacement-based finite element method under static shear and indentation. Additionally, the analytical expression of an incompatible rectangular finite element is adapted to accommodate an orthotropic case. Hexachiral and re-entrant honeycomb structures, characterized by auxetic behavior, are modeled as continuous media with homogenized properties using analytical expressions for their effective material constants. The findings reveal that while the classical shape functions may be sufficient for displacement modeling, they are ineffective in accurately predicting the characteristic auxetic behavior and stress distributions in auxetic materials. In contrast, the incompatible shape functions prove to be effective in providing appropriate stress modeling in both cases. This work underscores the relevance of the incompatible rectangular finite elements in the analysis of advanced materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. It provides computationally efficient approaches for the calculation of auxetic honeycomb structures and multilayer composites based on them.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Biomolecular Conformational Ensembles with PENSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02714v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-level simulations are widely used to study biomolecules and their dynamics. A common goal in such studies is to compare simulations of a molecular system under several conditions -- for example, with various mutations or bound ligands -- in order to identify differences between the molecular conformations adopted under these conditions. However, the large amount of data produced by simulations of ever larger and more complex systems often renders it difficult to identify the structural features that are relevant for a particular biochemical phenomenon. We present a flexible software package named PENSA that enables a comprehensive and thorough investigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles. It provides featurizations and feature transformations that allow for a complete representation of biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, including water and ion binding sites, thus avoiding bias that would come with manual feature selection. PENSA implements methods to systematically compare the distributions of molecular features across ensembles to find the significant differences between them and identify regions of interest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific information between two regions of a biomolecule, which allows, e.g., tracing information flow to identify allosteric pathways. PENSA also comes with convenient tools for loading data and visualizing results, making them quick to process and easy to interpret. PENSA is an open-source Python library maintained at https://github.com/drorlab/pensa along with an example workflow and a tutorial. We demonstrate its usefulness in real-world examples by showing how it helps to determine molecular mechanisms efficiently.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic modeling of the LiCl-KCl-LaCl$_3$ system with Bayesian model selection and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chloride molten salts are increasingly used in pyroprocessing techniques for the separation of lanthanides. Understanding thermodynamic properties of these salts is essential to predict their critical characteristics and optimize the separation process. Several thermodynamic models, including the associate model, the two-sublattice ionic model, and the modified quasichemical model with quadruplet approximation (MQMQA), have been utilized in the literature to capture the complexity of molten salts. In the present work, the Bayes factor is used to guide the model selection process for thermodynamic modeling of the KCl-LaCl3 system and provide statistical comparison of various models. The results indicate that the MQMQA model is the most favorable one based on available data. The LiCl-KCl-LaCl3 system has been further modelled with uncertainty quantification (UQ) using MQMQA with the thermodynamic properties of compounds in KCl-LaCl3 predicted by the quasiharmonic approach in terms of first-principles phonon calculations as a function of temperature. The calculated phase stability shows excellent agreement with experimental data, indicating that an appropriate thermodynamic model is important for accurately predicting critical characteristics of complex molten salts.</description>

      <title>Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions and different optimization strategies, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the optimal number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Ritz-Finite Element methods: Neural Network Methods trained with Finite Elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R} ^d, $ $d=1,2,3$ in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training, i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in 2D Photonics: Analysis and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence principle (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the possible presence of topologically protected interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In addition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes are of interest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP has been rigorously proved for 1D problems, but the 2D case is qualitatively different, because the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples presented in the paper are consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the BBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy density, as has also been shown to be the case in 1D and 1.5D.</description>

      <title>Explicit and data-Efficient Encoding via Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The autoencoder model typically uses an encoder to map data to a lower dimensional latent space and a decoder to reconstruct it. However, relying on an encoder for inversion can lead to suboptimal representations, particularly limiting in physical sciences where precision is key. We introduce a decoder-only method using gradient flow to directly encode data into the latent space, defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach eliminates the need for approximate encoder inversion. We train the decoder via the adjoint method and show that costly integrals can be avoided with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant, approximating Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for faster convergence. To handle stiff ODEs, we use an adaptive solver that prioritizes loss minimization, improving robustness. Compared to traditional autoencoders, our method demonstrates explicit encoding and superior data efficiency, which is crucial for data-scarce scenarios in the physical sciences. Furthermore, this work paves the way for integrating machine learning into scientific workflows, where precise and efficient encoding is critical. \footnote{The code for this work is available at \url{https://github.com/k-flouris/gfe}.}</description>
