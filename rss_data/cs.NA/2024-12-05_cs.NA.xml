      <title>Efficient hyperparameter estimation in Bayesian inverse problems using sample average approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Bayesian inverse problems, it is common to consider several hyperparameters that define the prior and the noise model that must be estimated from the data. In particular, we are interested in linear inverse problems with additive Gaussian noise and Gaussian priors defined using Mat\'{e}rn covariance models. In this case, we estimate the hyperparameters using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the marginalized posterior distribution. However, this is a computationally intensive task since it involves computing log determinants. To address this challenge, we consider a stochastic average approximation (SAA) of the objective function and use the preconditioned Lanczos method to compute efficient approximations of the function and gradient evaluations. We propose a new preconditioner that can be updated cheaply for new values of the hyperparameters and an approach to compute approximations of the gradient evaluations, by reutilizing information from the function evaluations. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on static and dynamic seismic tomography problems.</description>

      <title>Some lower bounds for optimal sampling recovery of functions with mixed smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there was a substantial progress in the problem of sampling recovery on function classes with mixed smoothness. Mostly, it has been done by proving new and sometimes optimal upper bounds for both linear sampling recovery and for nonlinear sampling recovery. In this paper we address the problem of lower bounds for the optimal rates of nonlinear sampling recovery.
  In the case of linear recovery one can use the well developed theory of estimating the Kolmogorov and linear widths for establishing some lower bounds for the optimal rates. In the case of nonlinear recovery we cannot use the above approach. It seems like the only technique, which is available now, is based on some simple observations. We demonstrate how these observations can be used.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Inverse Operator Networks for Solving PDE Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be seen as discovering a mapping from measurement data to unknown quantities, often framed within an operator learning approach. However, existing methods typically rely on large amounts of labeled training data, which is impractical for most real-world applications. Moreover, these supervised models may fail to capture the underlying physical principles accurately. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture called Physics-Informed Deep Inverse Operator Networks (PI-DIONs), which can learn the solution operator of PDE-based inverse problems without labeled training data. We extend the stability estimates established in the inverse problem literature to the operator learning framework, thereby providing a robust theoretical foundation for our method. These estimates guarantee that the proposed model, trained on a finite sample and grid, generalizes effectively across the entire domain and function space. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that PI-DIONs can effectively and accurately learn the solution operators of the inverse problems without the need for labeled data.</description>

      <title>Theory and Fast Learned Solver for $\ell^1$-TV Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\ell^1$ and total variation (TV) penalties have been used successfully in many areas, and the combination of the $\ell^1$ and TV penalties can lead to further improved performance. In this work, we investigate the mathematical theory and numerical algorithms for the $\ell^1$-TV model in the context of signal recovery: we derive the sample complexity of the $\ell^1$-TV model for recovering signals with sparsity and gradient sparsity. Also we propose a novel algorithm (PGM-ISTA) for the regularized $\ell^1$-TV problem, and establish its global convergence and parameter selection criteria. Furthermore, we construct a fast learned solver (LPGM-ISTA) by unrolling PGM-ISTA. The results for the experiment on ECG signals show the superior performance of LPGM-ISTA in terms of recovery accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Deep Operator BSDE: a Numerical Scheme to Approximate the Solution Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by dynamic risk measures and conditional $g$-expectations, in this work we propose a numerical method to approximate the solution operator given by a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE). The main ingredients for this are the Wiener chaos decomposition and the classical Euler scheme for BSDEs. We show convergence of this scheme under very mild assumptions, and provide a rate of convergence in more restrictive cases. We then implement it using neural networks, and we present several numerical examples where we can check the accuracy of the method.</description>

      <title>A Novel and Simple Invariant-Domain-Preserving Framework for PAMPA Scheme: 1D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PAMPA (Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted) method, proposed in [R. Abgrall, Commun. Appl. Math. Comput., 5: 370-402, 2023], combines conservative and non-conservative formulations of hyperbolic conservation laws to evolve cell averages and point values. Solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws typically have an invariant domain, and ensuring numerical solutions stay within this domain is essential yet nontrivial. This paper presents a novel framework for designing efficient Invariant-Domain-Preserving (IDP) PAMPA schemes. We first analyze the IDP property for updated cell averages in the original PAMPA scheme, revealing the role of cell average decomposition and midpoint values in maintaining the invariant domain. This analysis highlights the difficulty of relying on continuous fluxes alone to preserve the invariant domain. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple IDP limiter for cell midpoint values, and propose a provably IDP PAMPA scheme that guarantees the preservation of the invariant domain for updated cell averages without requiring post-processing limiters. This approach contrasts with existing bound-preserving PAMPA schemes, which often require additional convex limiting to blend high-order and low-order solutions. Most notably, inspired by the Softplus and Clipped ReLU functions from machine learning, we propose an automatic IDP reformulation of the governing equations, resulting in an unconditionally limiter-free IDP scheme for evolving point values. We also introduce techniques to suppress spurious oscillations, enabling the scheme to capture strong shocks effectively. Numerical experiments on 1D problems, including the linear convection equation, Burgers equation, the compressible Euler equations, and MHD equations, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed IDP PAMPA scheme.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the multi-dimensional semi-discrete Active Flux method using the Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degrees of freedom of Active Flux are cell averages and point values along the cell boundaries. These latter are shared between neighbouring cells, which gives rise to a globally continuous reconstruction. The semi-discrete Active Flux method uses its degrees of freedom to obtain Finite Difference approximations to the spatial derivatives which are used in the point value update. The averages are updated using a quadrature of the flux and making use of the point values as quadrature points. The integration in time employs standard Runge-Kutta methods. We show that this generalization of the Active Flux method in two and three spatial dimensions is stationarity preserving for linear acoustics on Cartesian grids, and present an analysis of numerical diffusion and stability.</description>

      <title>A Space-Time Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin Finite Element Formulation for a Modified Schr\"odinger Equation for Laser Pulse Propagation in Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation for modeling pulse propagation in optical waveguides. The proposed model bifurcates into a system of elliptic and hyperbolic equations depending on waveguide parameters. The proposed model leads to a stable first-order system of equations, distinguishing itself from the canonical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We have employed the space-time discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin finite element method to discretize the first-order system of equations. We present a stability analysis for both the elliptic and hyperbolic systems of equations and demonstrate the stability of the proposed model through several numerical examples on space-time meshes.</description>

      <title>Rusanov-type Schemes for Hyperbolic Equations: Wave-Speed Estimates, Monotonicity and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HLL-type schemes constitute a large hierarchy of numerical methods, in the finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin finite element frameworks, for solving hyperbolic equations. The hierarchy of fluxes includes Rusanov schemes, HLL schemes, HLLC schemes, and other variations. All of these schemes rely on wave speed estimates. Recent work has shown that most wave speed estimates in current use underestimate the true wave speeds. In the present paper we carry out a theoretical study of the consequences arising from errors in the wave speed estimates, on the monotonicity and stability properties of the derived schemes. For the simplest case of the hierarchy, that is Rusanov-type schemes, we carry out a detailed analysis in terms of the linear advection equation in one and two space dimensions. It is found that errors from underestimates of the wave speed could cause loss of monotonicity, severe reduction of the stability limit, and even loss of stability. Errors from overestimates, though preserving monotonicity, will cause a reduction of the stability limit. We find that overestimation is preferable to underestimation, for two reasons. First, schemes from overestimation are monotone, and second, their stability regions are larger than those from underestimation, for equivalent displacements from the exact speed. The findings of this paper may prove useful in raising awareness of the potential pitfalls of a seemingly simple practical computational task, that of providing wave speed estimates. Our reported findings may also motivate subsequent studies for complex non-linear hyperbolic systems, requiring estimates for two or more waves, such as in HLL and HLLC schemes.</description>

      <title>Microwave Remote Sensing of Soil Moisture, Above Ground Biomass and Freeze-Thaw Dynamic: Modeling and Empirical Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human actions have accelerated changes in global temperature, precipitation patterns, and other critical Earth systems. Key markers of these changes can be linked to the dynamic of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and related quantities, such as Soil Moisture (SM), Above Ground Biomass (AGB), and Freeze-Thaw (FT) Dynamics. These variables are crucial for understanding global climate changes, hydrological and carbon cycles included. Monitoring these variables helps to validate climate models and inform policy decisions. Technologies like microwave remote sensing provide critical tools for monitoring the effects of human activities on these variables at a global scale. Other than proper tachenological developments, the study of ECVs requires suitable theoretical retrieval tools, which leads to the solutions of inverse problems. In this brief survey, we analyze and summarize the main retrieval techniques available in the literature for SM, AGB, and FT, performed on data collected with microwave remote sensing sensors. Such methods will be some of the fundamental algorithms that can find applications in the research activities of the interdisciplinary, curiosity-driven, project {\it REmote sensing daTa INversion with multivariate functional modeling for essential climAte variables characterization (RETINA)}, recently funded by the European Union under the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan of NextGenerationEU, under the Italian Ministry of University and Research. The main goal of RETINA, in which three research units from three different italian universities are involved, is to create innovative techniques for analyzing data generated by the interaction of electromagnetic waves with the Earth's surface, applying theoretical insights to address real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Sinkhorn Algorithm for Sequentially Composed Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03120v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications, including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one sequential composition.</description>

      <title>Lebesgue constants for the Walsh system and the discrepancy of the van der Corput sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note we report on a coincidence of two mathematical quantities that, at first glance, have little to do with each other. On the one hand, there are the Lebesgue constants of the Walsh function system that play an important role in approximation theory, and on the other hand there is the star discrepancy of the van der Corput sequence that plays a prominent role in uniform distribution theory. Over the decades, these two quantities have been examined in great detail independently of each other and important results have been proven. Work in these areas has been carried out independently, but as we show here, they actually coincide. Interestingly, many theorems have been discovered in both areas independently, but some results have only been known in one area but not in the other.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Filtering, Estimation and Classification using Neural Jump ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Jump ODEs model the conditional expectation between observations by neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of effective transport for discrete uniaxial polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the bulk transport coefficients of uniaxial polycrystalline materials, including electrical and thermal conductivity, diffusivity, complex permittivity, and magnetic permeability, have Stieltjes integral representations involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators. The integral representations follow from resolvent representations of physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated with conductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and resistivity $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrix analysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory. We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random matrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete resolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involving the matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for the components of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^*$, involving spectral measures for the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms of their real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projection method that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that the spectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to a more efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulk transport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm by numerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and 3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.</description>

      <title>Solving Monge problem by Hilbert space embeddings of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose deep learning methods for classical Monge's optimal mass transportation problems, where where the distribution constraint is treated as penalty terms defined by the maximum mean discrepancy in the theory of Hilbert space embeddings of probability measures. We prove that the transport maps given by the proposed methods converge to optimal transport maps in the problem with $L^2$ cost. Several numerical experiments validate our methods. In particular, we show that our methods are applicable to large-scale Monge problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.02061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Scaled Relative Graph (SRG) is a geometric tool that maps the action of a multi-valued nonlinear operator onto the 2D plane, used to analyze the convergence of a wide range of iterative methods. As the SRG includes the spectrum for linear operators, we can view the SRG as a generalization of the spectrum to multi-valued nonlinear operators. In this work, we further study the SRG of linear operators and characterize the SRG of block-diagonal and normal matrices.</description>

Abstract: We prove lower bounds on the error incurred when approximating any oscillating function using piecewise polynomial spaces. The estimates are explicit in the polynomial degree and have optimal dependence on the meshwidth and frequency when the polynomial degree is fixed. These lower bounds, for example, apply when approximating solutions to Helmholtz plane wave scattering problem.</description>

      <title>A conservative, implicit solver for 0D-2V multi-species nonlinear Fokker-Planck collision equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present an optimal implicit algorithm specifically designed to accurately solve the multi-species nonlinear 0D-2V axisymmetric Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FPR) collision equation while preserving mass, momentum, and energy. Our approach relies on the utilization of nonlinear Shkarofsky's formula of FPR (FPRS) collision operator in the spherical-polar coordinate. The key innovation lies in the introduction of a new function named King, with the adoption of the Legendre polynomial expansion for the angular coordinate and King function expansion for the speed coordinate. The Legendre polynomial expansion will converge exponentially and the King method, a moment convergence algorithm, could ensure the conservation with high precision in discrete form. Additionally, post-step projection onto manifolds is employed to exactly enforce symmetries of the collision operators. Through solving several typical problems across various nonequilibrium configurations, we demonstrate the high accuracy and superior performance of the presented algorithm for weakly anisotropic plasmas.</description>

      <title>SUPG-stabilized time-DG finite and virtual elements for the time-dependent advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a stability and convergence analysis for the fully discrete scheme obtained by combining a finite or virtual element spatial discretization with the upwind-discontinuous Galerkin time-stepping applied to the time-dependent advection-diffusion equation. A space-time streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin term is used to stabilize the method. More precisely, we show that the method is inf-sup stable with constant independent of the diffusion coefficient, which ensures the robustness of the method in the convection- and diffusion-dominated regimes. Moreover, we prove optimal convergence rates in both regimes for the error in the energy norm. An important feature of the presented analysis is the control in the full $L^2(0,T;L^2(\Omega))$ norm without the need of introducing an artificial reaction term in the model. We finally present some numerical experiments in $(3 + 1)$-dimensions that validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Re-anchoring Quantum Monte Carlo with Tensor-Train Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, having a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for avoiding sign problems. Typically, this trial wavefunction is fixed throughout the simulation. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems, achieving a relative error of \(10^{-5}\) in estimating ground-state energies. Additionally, the overlap between our estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction achieves a high-fidelity. We provide a convergence proof, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimate.</description>

      <title>Towards Size-Independent Generalization Bounds for Deep Operator Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent times machine learning methods have made significant advances in becoming a useful tool for analyzing physical systems. A particularly active area in this theme has been "physics-informed machine learning" which focuses on using neural nets for numerically solving differential equations. In this work, we aim to advance the theory of measuring out-of-sample error while training DeepONets - which is among the most versatile ways to solve P.D.E systems in one-shot. Firstly, for a class of DeepONets, we prove a bound on their Rademacher complexity which does not explicitly scale with the width of the nets involved. Secondly, we use this to show how the Huber loss can be chosen so that for these DeepONet classes generalization error bounds can be obtained that have no explicit dependence on the size of the nets. The effective capacity measure for DeepONets that we thus derive is also shown to correlate with the behavior of generalization error in experiments.</description>

      <title>Inexact Newton methods with matrix approximation by sampling for nonlinear least-squares and systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze stochastic inexact Gauss-Newton methods for nonlinear least-squares problems and inexact Newton methods for nonlinear systems of equations. Random models are formed using suitable sampling strategies for the matrices involved in the deterministic models. The analysis of the expected number of iterations needed in the worst case to achieve a desired level of accuracy in the first-order optimality condition provides guidelines for applying sampling and enforcing, with fixed probability, a suitable accuracy in the random approximations. Results of the numerical validation of the algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Higher-Order Finite Element Methods for Hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a matrix-free finite element solver for finite-strain elasticity adopting an $hp$-multigrid preconditioner. Compared to classical algorithms relying on a global sparse matrix, matrix-free solution strategies significantly reduce memory traffic by repeated evaluation of the finite element integrals.
  Following this approach in the context of finite-strain elasticity, the precise statement of the final weak form is crucial for performance, and it is not clear a priori whether to choose problem formulations in the material or spatial domain. With a focus on hyperelastic solids in biomechanics, the arithmetic costs to evaluate the material law at each quadrature point might favor an evaluation strategy where some quantities are precomputed in each Newton iteration and reused in the Krylov solver for the linearized problem. Hence, we discuss storage strategies to balance the compute load against memory access in compressible and incompressible neo-Hookean models and an anisotropic tissue model. Additionally, numerical stability becomes increasingly important using lower/mixed-precision ingredients and approximate preconditioners to better utilize modern hardware architectures.
  Application of the presented method to a patient-specific geometry of an iliac bifurcation shows significant speed-ups, especially for higher polynomial degrees, when compared to alternative approaches with matrix-based geometric or black-box algebraic multigrid preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Improved Spectral Density Estimation via Explicit and Implicit Deflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study algorithms for approximating the spectral density of a symmetric matrix $A$ that is accessed through matrix-vector product queries. By combining a previously studied Chebyshev polynomial moment matching method with a deflation step that approximately projects off the largest magnitude eigendirections of $A$ before estimating the spectral density, we give an $\epsilon\cdot\sigma_\ell(A)$ error approximation to the spectral density in the Wasserstein-$1$ metric using $O(\ell\log n+ 1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products, where $\sigma_\ell(A)$ is the $\ell^{th}$ largest singular value of $A$. In the common case when $A$ exhibits fast singular value decay, our bound can be much stronger than prior work, which gives an error bound of $\epsilon \cdot ||A||_2$ using $O(1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products. We also show that it is nearly tight: any algorithm giving error $\epsilon \cdot \sigma_\ell(A)$ must use $\Omega(\ell+1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products.
  We further show that the popular Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (SLQ) method matches the above bound, even though SLQ itself is parameter-free and performs no explicit deflation. This bound explains the strong practical performance of SLQ, and motivates a simple variant of SLQ that achieves an even tighter error bound. Our error bound for SLQ leverages an analysis that views it as an implicit polynomial moment matching method, along with recent results on low-rank approximation with single-vector Krylov methods. We use these results to show that the method can perform implicit deflation as part of moment matching.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Cavitation Dynamics on Free Ogee Spillways Using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating complex hydraulic conditions, particularly two-phase flows over spillway chutes, can be achieved with high accuracy using three-dimensional numerical models. This study investigates the potential for vacuum generation and cavitation phenomena on the Aghchai Dam service spillway through numerical simulations conducted in Flow-3D. The analysis focuses on two specific flow rates, 4400 and 1065 cubic meters per second, as determined by experimental data. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is employed to accurately calculate the free surface flow. Simulation results at a discharge rate of 4400 cubic meters per second indicate a high likelihood of cavitation at critical locations, including the ogee curve and the angle transition in the chute channel. These areas require specific mitigation measures to prevent cavitation-induced damage. In contrast, at the lower flow rate of 1065 cubic meters per second, the risk of cavitation is minimal due to reduced flow velocity and the absence of flow separation from the bed. The numerical findings align closely with empirical observations, demonstrating the reliability of the simulation approach in predicting cavitation behavior.</description>
