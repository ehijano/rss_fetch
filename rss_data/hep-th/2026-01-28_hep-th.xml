      <title>Towards a Proof of the Improved Quantum Null Energy Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Improved Quantum Null Energy Condition (INEC) was recently derived from the (restricted) quantum focusing conjecture (QFC), and is a statement about the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of field theories in Minkowski space-time. It is a stronger condition than the quantum null energy condition (QNEC), and includes the possibility of expanding or contracting geodesics. Using the properties of relative entropy and modular Hamiltonian associated with null deformation of the sphere, we show the INEC holds under an additional assumption relating the EMT to the relative entropy. Furthermore, using the QNEC and INEC as a basis, we briefly speculate about a possible modified Quantum Focusing Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Tame Complexity of Effective Field Theories in the Quantum Gravity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theories consistent with quantum gravity obey surprising finiteness constraints, appearing in several distinct but interconnected forms. In this work we develop a framework that unifies these observations by proposing that the defining data of such theories, as well as the landscape of effective field theories that are valid at least up to a fixed cutoff, admit descriptions with a uniform bound on complexity. To make this precise, we use tame geometry and work in sharply o-minimal structures, in which tame sets and functions come with two integer parameters that quantify their information content; we call this pair their tame complexity. Our Finite Complexity Conjectures are supported by controlled examples in which an infinite Wilsonian expansion nevertheless admits an equivalent finite-complexity description, typically through hidden rigidity conditions such as differential or recursion relations. We further assemble evidence from string compactifications, highlighting the constraining role of moduli space geometry and the importance of dualities. This perspective also yields mathematically well-defined notions of counting and volume measures on the space of effective theories, formulated in terms of effective field theory domains and coverings, whose finiteness is naturally enforced by the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Thermal Gauge Theory for a Rotating Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic and complete study of thermal gauge theory for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also of average angular momentum. This work extends previous studies, which focused on pure scalar-fermion theories, to all gauge theories coupled to an arbitrary matter sector. Path-integral methods are developed to study ensemble averages and thermal Green's functions of general operators, with an arbitrary number of points, in all interacting gauge theories. These methods cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalisms. Generalized Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) conditions are obtained both in coordinate and in momentum space for operators in general representations of the Lorentz and internal symmetry group. This allows us to obtain all thermal propagators including those of gauge fields and Faddeev-Popov ghosts. By analyzing all interactions in detail, it is shown that, in perturbation theory, only the propagators are affected by the average angular momentum and the chemical potentials, the vertices remain unmodified. The paper presents fully model-independent results and can, therefore, be applied to any specific thermal field theory.</description>

      <title>Schubert line defects in 3d GLSMs, part II: Partial flag manifolds and parabolic quantum polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Schubert line defects in the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) with target space a partial flag manifold $X={\rm Fl}({\boldsymbol{k}};n)$, generalizing our construction for complete flag manifolds given in a companion paper arXiv:2512.19802 (part I). In the context of the 3d GLSM/quantum K-theory correspondence, the Schubert line defects are constructed as 1d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to the 3d field theory, and they flow to objects supported on Schubert varieties $X_w \subseteq X$ in the quantum K-theory. The flavored Witten index of the 1d defect is expected to compute the Chern character of $[\mathcal{O}_w]$ -- more precisely, it gives us a polynomial representative of the Schubert class in the quantum K-theory ring. We give strong evidence for this claim by showing in examples that the Witten indices of Schubert defects indeed reproduce a recently-defined set of polynomials that represent the Schubert classes in the Whitney presentation, which we call the parabolic Whitney polynomials. Moreover, upon using the quantum ring relations, we can convert these polynomials into seemingly new polynomials in the Toda presentation, which we call the parabolic quantum Grothendieck polynomials. These new polynomials specialize to known polynomials in various limits, including to the quantum Grothendieck polynomials in the case of the complete flag. In the 2d limit, our construction also realizes the Schubert classes $[X_w]$ in the quantum cohomology ring of the partial flag manifold, and the parabolic quantum Grothendieck polynomials then reduce to previously known parabolic quantum Schubert polynomials.</description>

      <title>Type-A Conformal Anomalies from Euler Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the type-A conformal anomaly in $2n$ dimensions follows from standard Stora-Zumino descent, starting from the Euler invariant polynomial for the Euclidean conformal group $SO(2n+1,1)$ in $6d$, thereby placing type-A anomalies on the same footing as ordinary perturbative t Hooft anomalies. We discuss implications for anomaly inflow, and t Hooft anomaly matching for the full conformal group with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. In 4d, this enables the construction of a dilaton effective action matching the full type-A $SO(5,1)$ conformal anomaly.</description>

      <title>Geometry of in-in correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of polytopes -- in-in zonotopes -- whose boundary structure organizes the contributions to scalar equal-time correlators in flat space computed via the in-in formalism. We provide explicit Minkowski sum and facet descriptions of these polytopes, and show that their boundaries factorize into products of graphical zonotopes and lower-dimensional in-in zonotopes, thereby mimicking the factorization structure of the correlators themselves. Evaluating their canonical forms at the origin -- equivalently, calculating the volume of the dual polytope -- reproduces the correlator. Finally, in a simple example, we show that the wavefunction decomposition of the correlator corresponds to a subdivision of the dual polytope.</description>

      <title>Singular field redefinition between Witten's string field theory and Witten's theory deformed by Ellwood invariant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a field redefinition between Witten's string field theory and its deformation by the Ellwood invariant. This field redefinition is singular and does not imply physical equivalence between them. However, it allows us to formally transfer classical solutions of Witten's theory to solutions of the deformed theory. Although the resulting solutions are also generically singular and require careful examination of their physical interpretation, we show that the tachyon vacuum solution can be consistently transferred from Witten's theory to the deformed theory.</description>

      <title>Interpolating conformal algebra in $(1+1)$ dimensions between the instant form and the light-front form of relativistic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the interpolating conformal algebra between the instant form dynamics (IFD) and the light-front dynamics (LFD) in $(1+1)$ dimensions, along with a $4\times4$ interpolating projective spacetime matrix representation. While there are six generators in the $(1+1)$ dimensional conformal algebra, the number of kinematic and dynamic generators dramatically changes in LFD, maximizing (minimizing) the number of kinematic (dynamic) generators to four (two) with respect to two (four) kinematic (dynamic) generators in IFD, as well as in any other forms of dynamics between IFD and LFD. It confirms and signifies the utility of LFD, saving substantial dynamical efforts in solving the $(1+1)$ dimensional quantum field theories. We also present $2\times2$ Pauli matrix representation of $(1+0)$ and $(0+1)$ conformal groups, and creation/annihilation operators of quantum simple harmonic oscillator representations of $(1+0)$ dimensional conformal groups.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel approach to the one-loop effective action for nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19339v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a heat kernel method to compute the one-loop effective action for a general class of nonlinear electrodynamic (NLED) theories in four dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Working in the background field formalism, we extract the logarithmically divergent part of the effective action, the so-called induced action, corresponding to the DeWitt $a_2$ coefficient of the heat kernel. In NLED, quantisation yields non-minimal differential operators, for which standard heat kernel techniques are not immediately applicable. Considering the weak-field regime, we calculate the $a_0$, $a_1$ and $a_2$ contributions to leading order in the background electromagnetic field strength. Finally, we consider conformal NLED theories and compute the $a_0$ contribution to all orders. For this class, we comment on the role of causality being necessary and sufficient for the convergence of the exact $a_1$ and $a_2$ contributions.</description>

      <title>Towards an Action Principle Unifying the Standard Model and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single geometric invariant fixes the relative normalization and structure of gravity, Yang-Mills theory, and fermion kinetic terms -- including ghost freedom in the gravitational sector -- without tuning. Our results establish a minimal geometric route to unification that does not rely on extra dimensions or symmetry breaking by hand. Unlike previous gauge-gravity constructions, the relative normalizations and ghost freedom emerge from a single Clifford-algebraic invariant, without explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Symmetric polynomials: DIM integrable systems versus twisted Cherednik systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss interrelations between eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonians associated with the commutative (integer ray) subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra and those of the twisted Cherednik system. In the case of $t=q^{-m}$ with natural $m$, eigenfunctions of the first system of Hamiltonians are the twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions (BAFs) introduced by O. Chalykh, while eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians are twisted non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Actually, the twisted Cherednik ground state is symmetric and coincides with a peculiar symmetric BAF. We lift this correspondence to excited states, and claim that both Cherednik eigenfunctions and BAF's can be combined to produce symmetric functions, which coincide with each other and are eigenfunctions of the both DIM Hamiltonians and power sums of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians at once. This reflects the correspondence between the DIM algebra and the spherical DAHA explicitly.</description>

      <title>Wigner distribution of Sine Gordon and Kink solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02531v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wigner distributions play a significant role in formulating the phase space analogue of quantum mechanics. The Schrodinger wave-functional for solitons is needed to derive it for solitons. The Wigner distribution derived can further be used for calculating the charge distributions, current densities and wave function amplitude in position or momentum space. It can be also used to calculate the upper bound of the quantum speed limit time. We derive and analyze the Wigner distributions for Kink and Sine-Gordon solitons by evaluating the Schrodinger wave-functional for both solitons. The charge, current density, and quantum speed limit for solitons are also discussed which we obtain from the derived analytical expression of Wigner distributions.</description>

      <title>Feshbach-Villars Hamiltonian Approach to the Klein-Gordon Oscillator and Supercritical Step Scattering in Standard and Generalized Doubly Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a first-order Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian framework for spin-0 relativistic quantum dynamics in the presence of Planck-scale kinematic deformations described within generalized doubly special relativity (G-DSR). Starting from a generic nonlinear momentum-space map, we derive the corresponding modified dispersion relation (MDR) at leading order in the Planck length \(l_p\) and construct a consistent FV linearization of the deformed Klein-Gordon operator. The resulting two-component Hamiltonian remains \(\sigma_3\)-pseudo-Hermitian at \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\), which guarantees conservation of the FV charge and current and provides a current-based definition of reflection and transmission in stationary scattering.
  As applications, we study two benchmark settings in which the FV metric structure is essential: (i) the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon oscillator and (ii) scattering from electrostatic step and barrier potentials. For the oscillator, we obtain controlled \(\mathcal{O}(l_p)\) branch-resolved spectral shifts and show how kinetic versus mass-shell deformations reshape the level spacing and the high-energy spectral compression. For step and barrier scattering, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients directly from the pseudo-Hermitian FV current and quantify the deformation-induced shift of the supercritical (pair-production) threshold. A comparative analysis of the Amelino-Camelia and Magueijo-Smolin realizations indicates that MS-type deformations generally delay the onset of the supercritical regime and reduce the magnitude of the negative transmitted flux within the validity domain \(l_p E \ll 1\).</description>

      <title>Jordan-Wigner mapping between quantum-spin and fermionic Casimir effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation connects spin operators in one-dimensional spin systems and fermionic operators. In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions are stable and topologically non-trivial field configurations that behave like localized particles. They appear in the chiral effective theory for pions, where they correspond to the baryon states, and might also exist in the electroweak theory, in the presence of certain effective interactions. In this paper, focusing on toy models that capture different limits of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (SM), we show that skyrmions not classically stable at zero temperature can be stabilized by thermal effects. This result motivates the study of skyrmions in the quantum effective action of the SM, potentially implying the existence of dark matter without new physics.</description>

Abstract: Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) is a key tool for exploring the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon through Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distributions and fragmentation functions. While leading-power contributions to the SIDIS cross-section are well established, next-to-leading (NLP) of order $1/Q$ and next-to-next-to-leading power (NNLP) corrections of order $1/Q^2$ to the hadronic tensor have only recently begun to be systematically investigated. These corrections are essential for the reliable phenomenology and interpretation of modern high-precision data. In recent papers by one of the authors, NNLP corrections to Drell-Yan process were derived using rapidity factorization formalism. In the present work we extend this approach to SIDIS and obtain analytic expressions for the unpolarized structure functions. We derive NNLP corrections that include convolutions of unpolarized distributions, $f_1$, with unpolarized fragmentation functions, $D_1$, and Boer-Mulders functions, $h_1^\perp$, with Collins fragmentation functions, $H_1^\perp$. We compare our results with previous formulations, provide numerical studies, confront our predictions with HERMES and COMPASS measurements, and present predictions for future experiments at Jefferson Lab and the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in light of ACT data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the inflationary epoch, we investigate the reconstruction of the background variables within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, considering the scalar spectral index $n_s(N)$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r(N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of $e-$folds. Under a general formalism, we determine the effective potential and the coupling function associated with the Gauss-Bonnet term as functions of the cosmological parameters $n_s(N)$ and $r(N)$, respectively. To implement the reconstruction methodology for the background variables, we study an example in which the attractors for the index $n_s$ and the ratio $r$ are in agreement with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. In this context, explicit expressions for the effective potential $V(\phi)$ and the coupling parameter $\xi(\phi)$ are reconstructed. Moreover, the reconstruction based on observational parameters shows that $V(\phi)\not\propto 1/\xi(\phi)$, in contrast to the assumption adopted in the literature for the study of the evolution of the universe in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <title>Classical emergence of the quantum-backreacted BTZ black hole from exponential electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit a recently reported generalization of the Ba\~nados--Teitelboim--Zanelli black hole arising in New Massive Gravity sourced by the quantum fluctuations of scalar matter, now examined through the lens of a purely classical framework. We show that the same geometry, distinguished by its logarithmic asymptotic structure, emerges as the unique static solution of Einstein gravity coupled to an exponential nonlinear electrodynamics. We trace the origin of this correspondence and prove that this geometry belongs to a unique class of metrics constituting the intersection of the moduli spaces of the static and circularly symmetric sectors of the two theories, thereby revealing a dynamical equivalence between them. An explicit mapping is established between the global charges of the nonlinearly charged black holes and the parameters governing the quantum backreaction in New Massive Gravity, allowing for a natural reinterpretation of the quantum imprints in terms of classical charges. A detailed analysis of the horizon structure of these spacetimes is presented. In addition, the full thermodynamics of the more general configurations is constructed using the Iyer--Wald formalism, from which we derive the first law and the associated Smarr relation. Altogether, our results provide a classical realization of a semiclassical spacetime and point toward a broader correspondence between higher-curvature corrections in quantum gravity and nonlinear effects in self-gravitating electrodynamics in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Detecting the finer structure of the P vs NP problem with statistical mechanics: the case of the Wang tiling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the idea that the P vs NP problem can have a finer structure. Given the NP complete problem of interest, the configurations space of the problem can be divided in (at least) two regions. In one region, polynomial algorithms to solve the NP complete problem of interest are available (and we discuss one possible realization inspire by the games of chess and go). In the second region the problem to find polynomial time algorithms is very similar to the problem to find polynomial time algorithms to determine the asymptotic behavior of discrete dynamical systems in the chaotic regime. We cannot exclude the existence of a third region which separates the first two: this region would have the characteristics of the edge of chaos. We focuss on the Wang tiling problem of an N X N square (with N large): here a Wang tiles set Gamma is an alphabet. We construct a statistical-physics inspired heuristic which allows to define good alphabets as the ones with a good thermodynamical behavior. For (a suitable subclass of) good alphabets we construct an algortihm which, in polynomial time, determines how to tile the N x N square. On the other hand, for bad alphabets, we observe a chaotic behavior. The Cook-Levin theorem advocate a similar pattern for all the NP-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Exact calculations beyond charge neutrality in timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timelike Liouville field theory (also known as imaginary Liouville theory or imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos) is expected to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity in a positive-curvature regime, but its path integral is not a probability measure and rigorous exact computations are currently available only in the charge-neutral (integer screening) case. In this paper we show that at the special coupling $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, the Coulomb-gas expansion of the timelike path integral becomes explicitly computable beyond charge neutrality. The reason is that the $n$-fold integrals generated by the interaction acquire a Vandermonde/determinantal structure at $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, which allows exact evaluation in terms of classical special functions. We derive Mellin-Barnes type representations (involving the Barnes $G$-function and, in a three-point case, Gauss hypergeometric functions) for the zero- and one-point functions, for an antipodal two-point function, and for a three-point function with a resonant insertion $\alpha_2=b$. We then address the subtle zero-mode integration: after a Gaussian regularization we obtain an explicit renormalized partition function $C(1/\sqrt{2},\mu)=e(4\pi\sqrt2 \mu)^{-1}$, identify distributional limits in the physically relevant regime $\alpha_j=\frac{1}{2}Q+\mathrm{i} P_j$, and compare with the Hankel-contour prescription recently proposed in the physics literature. These results provide the first rigorously controlled family of exact calculations in timelike Liouville theory outside charge neutrality.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Quantum Entanglement Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is an expository account aimed at viewing entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a phenomenon of global geometry. While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme.
  The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme.
  Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry.</description>

      <title>Spiral Density Waves and Torque Balance in the Kerr Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in relativistic accretion discs are a key science target for the upcoming LISA mission. Existing models of disc-EMRI interactions typically rely on crude dynamical friction or Newtonian planetary migration prescriptions, which fail to capture the relativistic fluid response induced by the binary potential. In this work we address this gap by providing the relativistic calculation. We apply standard methods from self-force theory, black hole perturbation theory, and relativistic stellar perturbation theory to perform the full fluid calculation of the relativistic analogue of planetary migration for the first time. We calculate the response of a fluid in the perturbing potential of an EMRI consistently incorporating pressure effects. Using a master enthalpy-like variable and linearised fluid theory, we reconstruct the fluid perturbations and relativistic spiral arm structure for a range of spin values in the Kerr geometry. We conclude by deriving a relativistic torque-balance equation that enables computation and comparison of local torques with advected angular momentum through the disc. This opens a promising route towards establishing torque-balance relations between integrated disc torques arising from fluid perturbations and the forces acting on EMRIs embedded in matter.</description>

      <title>Origin of the nucleon gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent lattice QCD simulations and phenomenological models indicate that the nucleon's gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$ remains remarkably small at finite momentum transfer $t$. While $B_N(0) = 0$ is a known consequence of the equivalence principle, the physical origin of its suppression at finite $t$ has not been fully elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ arises from a fundamental cancellation within the nucleon's wave functions. Using light-front holographic QCD, we show that $B_N(t)$ is governed by an antisymmetric factor in the longitudinal dynamics that leads to an exact vanishing in the symmetric limit and significant suppression for realistic nucleon structures. Our results suggest that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ is a signature of the nucleon's dominant S-wave character, providing a formal justification for its frequent omission in practical applications like near-threshold $J/\psi$ production.</description>

      <title>Wheeler-DeWitt Equation for Black Hole Interiors in Asymptotically Safe Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with scale-dependent gravitational couplings within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. In the Hamiltonian formulation based on a renormalization-group improved Einstein-Hilbert action, the consistency of the theory and the Poisson algebra of constraints have been clarified. Within this framework, we show that, despite the explicit scale dependence of Newton's constant, the classical solutions are generically unaffected by the running of the coupling.
  We then derive the Wheeler-DeWitt equation incorporating the scale dependence of the gravitational couplings and analyze its solutions in the minisuperspace framework. In the classical limit, while the scale dependence of Newton's constant does not affect the classical behavior, the running of the cosmological constant can contribute to the classical solutions. Moreover, we show that the quantum behavior in the ultraviolet regime acts toward suppressing singularity formation in all cases, independently of how the renormalization-group scale is identified with spacetime coordinates and of the relative magnitudes of the ultraviolet fixed points of the running Newton's constant and cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Chiral Phase Transitions: The Role of Polyakov Loop Kinetics Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied a crucial but often oversimplified ingredient in predicting gravitational-wave signals from QCD-type phase transitions: the kinetic term of the Polyakov loop. For the first time, we derive this term from first principles in finite-temperature pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory, incorporating a field-dependent renormalization factor--a calculation we also extend to theories with more colors. Employing this derived kinetic term alongside three commonly-used effective potentials (the Haar-measure, polynomial, and quasi-particle models), we demonstrate that it substantially modifies the predicted GW energy spectrum from confinement transitions by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Based on this, we provide the first complete analysis of the chiral transition within the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) framework, described by the quark condensate. Our results reveal a clear dichotomy: while the Polyakov-loop kinetic term critically shapes GWs from confinement transitions, it has a negligible impact on the dynamics of the chiral transition, which is dominated by fermion condensation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-metricity provides a natural extension of Riemannian geometry, yet its experimental signatures remain largely unexplored. In this work we investigate how spacetime non-metricity can be probed through high-precision observations, focusing on atomic clocks and gravitational waves as complementary tools. Working within Weyl geometry as a minimal realization of vectorial non-metricity, we formulate observable effects in a gauge-invariant manner and show that they are associated with path-dependent length transport governed by the Weyl field strength. We derive constraints from atomic-clock experiments and demonstrate that, although gravitational waves do not directly source the Weyl field at linear order, its dynamical contribution induces a backreaction on gravitational-wave propagation, leading to an anomalous strain. As a result, the absence of deviations from General Relativity in current gravitational-wave observations already places meaningful and strong constraints on dynamical non-metric degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of radiation from global strings and the relic axion density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss key aspects of the nature of radiation from global strings and its impact on the relic axion density. Using a simple model we demonstrate the dependence on the spectrum of radiation emitted by strings. We then study the radiation emitted by perturbed straight strings paying particular attention to the difference between the overall phase of the field and the small perturbations about the string solution which are the axions. We find that a significant correction is required to be sure that one is analyzing the axions and not the self-field of the string. Typically this requires one to excise a sizeable region around the string - something which is not usually done in the case of numerical field theory simulations of string networks. We have measured the spectrum of radiation from these strings and find that it is compatible with an exponential, as predicted by the Nambu-like Kalb-Ramond action, and in particular is not a ``hard'' spectrum often found in string network simulations. We conclude by attempting to assess the uncertainties on relic density and find that this leads to a range of possible axion masses when compared to the measured density from the Cosmic Microwave Background, albeit that they are typically higher than what is predicted by the Initial Misalignment Mechanism. If the decay is via a ``soft spectrum'' from loops produced close to the backreaction scale we find that $m_{\rm a}\approx 160\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and a detection frequency $f\approx 38\,{\rm GHz}$. If axions are emitted directly by the string network, and we use emission spectra reported in field theory simulations, then $m_{\rm a}\approx 4\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 1\,{\rm GHz}$, however this increases to $m_a \approx 125\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 30\,{\rm GHz}$ using our spectra for the case of an oscillating string. In all scenarios there are significant remaining uncertainties that we delineate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its parabolic character, the diffusion equation exhibits instantaneous spatial spreading, and becomes unstable when Lorentz-boosted. According to the conventional interpretation, these features reflect a fundamental incompatibility with special relativity. In this Letter, we show that this interpretation is incorrect by demonstrating that any smooth and sufficiently localized solution of the diffusion equation is the particle density of an exact solution of the relativistic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. This establishes the existence of a causal, stable, and thermodynamically consistent relativistic kinetic theory whose hydrodynamic sector is governed exactly by diffusion at all wavelengths. We further demonstrate that the standard arguments for instability arise from considering solutions that admit no counterpart in kinetic theory, and that apparent violations of causality disappear once signals are defined in terms of the underlying microscopic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the well-known unitary equivalence between Fokker-Planck operators and Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians, we compute the quasi-normal-mode spectrum of ultrarelativistic kinetic theories with momentum-space diffusion. We show that the collision operator reduces to a Dirac-delta Schr\"odinger problem in one spatial dimension, and to a Coulomb Schr\"odinger operator with hydrogenic spectrum in three dimensions. Finite spatial wavenumber appears as a perturbation of the associated quantum potential. The hydrodynamic mode is found to obey exact Fick-type diffusion at all real wavenumbers, whereas relativistic kinematics generically produces a continuous ballistic band in the non-hydrodynamic sector, a feature absent in the Newtonian regime.</description>

Abstract: In General Relativity, there exist two objects of limiting compactness, one with a null boundary defining the horizon of a black hole and the other with a timelike boundary defining a Buchdahl star. The two are characterized by gravitational energy equal to or half the mass. Since non-gravitational mass-energy is the source of gravitational energy, both of these objects are manifestly stable. We demonstrate in this letter, in a simple and general way, that the equilibrium state defining the object is indeed stable, independent of the nature of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Width of the Flux Tube as a tool to explore confining mechanisms in Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the profile of the flux tube in the SU(2) gauge model in (2 + 1) dimensions, with a particular attention to the so called "intrinsic width" which drives the exponential decay of the flux density at large transverse distances and represents a new physical scale of the model. This quantity is directly related to the confining mechanism which generates the flux tube and can be used to test its properties. We study a wide range of different values of lattice spacing, temperature and flux tube lengths and show that our data are precise enough to distinguish between different confining models. In particular we show that at high temperatures (just below the deconfinement transition) the data are perfectly described by an Ising-like effective model based on the Svetitsky-Yaffe mapping. At lower temperatures this approximation does not hold anymore. In this regime (which is the most interesting one from a physical point of view) we test several alternative proposals and show that the dual superconductor model is the one which better fits the data. However, this proposal is not fully satisfactory, because the values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter extracted from the fits increase with the length of the flux tube, which is not a feature predicted by the model. This suggests that a more sophisticated model is needed to explain confinement in non-abelian gauge theories and, at the same time, that our data on the intrinsic width may be a powerful tool to benchmark these candidates.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Neutrino Deficit via Torsion-Induced Flavor Change in f(T) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the spacetime torsion can modify neutrino flavor oscillations in f(T) gravity. This offers a probe of modified teleparallel gravity in astrophysical environments. By using the Dirac action in teleparallel geometry, we derive an effective coupling between the torsion vector and neutrino current. In the weak-field limit around a spherical mass, we obtain analytical expressions for torsion-induced phase shifts and effective mass-squared differences. Our results indicate that both vacuum oscillations and the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance in matter are affected by these torsion-based modifications. Using solar neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande, SNO, Borexino, and KamLAND, we constrain the teleparallel model parameters and also the neutrino-torsion coupling.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent calculation of non-spherical Bose-Einstein correlation functions with Coulomb final-state interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle correlations and femtoscopy are a rich subfield of high-energy physics. As the experimental data become more precise, there is an increasing need for the theoretical calculations to provide better and more general descriptions of the measurements. One of the important new directions is the investigation of the precise shape of the Bose-Einstein correlation functions utilizing L\'evy-stable distributions. This work is a direct follow-up to our previous study, in which we developed a novel method for calculating Bose-Einstein correlation functions including the Coulomb final-state interaction. In this paper, we present a self-consistent generalization of the previous approach to non-spherical source functions and investigate the validity of the previously applied approximations assuming spherical symmetry. We present a software package that includes the calculation of a fully three-dimensional correlation function including the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Glueball mass from RGZ-inspired infrared gluodynamics: a Euclidean Bethe-Salpeter approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate and solve a Euclidean Bethe-Salpeter equation for the lightest scalar glueball (0++) in pure Yang-Mills theory, using the refined Gribov-Zwanziger gluon tree-level propagator as an infrared-complete input. In a minimal ladder truncation with an effective constant kernel strength g_C^2 and the dominant s-wave component, we extract scalar glueball masses in the range 1.7-2.3 GeV for representative values of g_C^2, with a preferred value around 1.9 GeV near g_C^2 = 0.54. The result is consistent with RGZ correlator-based infrared moment analyses and with lattice expectations, providing a cross-check of RGZ-inspired infrared gluodynamics from a bound-state viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Strong CP and the QCD Axion: Lecture Notes via Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes provide a self-contained, graduate-level introduction to the strong $CP$ problem and QCD axion physics from an effective field theory (EFT) viewpoint. We review the construction of the chiral EFT of QCD yielding a $\theta$-dependent potential, from which vacuum alignment, $\theta$ periodicity and branch structure follow. We further show how the framework leads to the Witten-Veneziano relation highlighting the role of the pure-glue topological susceptibility in organizing $\theta$-dependent hadronic observables. Using these tools, we show how to extract representative $CP$-odd mesonic and baryonic amplitudes, including the chiral estimate underlying the neutron EDM bound, and how to generalize the effective framework to confining SU(N) theories with fermions in arbitrary representations. We further show how to employ the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to extract salient information on the $\theta$-dependent physics of one-flavour QCD via orientifold planar equivalence. We also revisit a recent no strong $CP$ claim based on an ordering of limits in the sum over topological sectors and show, in the EFT language, that it amounts to introducing an extra non-propagating axion-like degree of freedom not required by QCD. We then present the standard dynamical resolution to the strong $CP$ problem, i.e. the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, the resulting axion potential and mass from chiral EFT and briefly review associated time-honored UV completions, and the axion quality problem from gravitational corrections.</description>

      <title>A two-mode model for black hole evaporation and information flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a two-oscillator model for black hole evaporation in which an effective geometric degree of freedom and a representative Hawking radiation mode are described by coupled harmonic oscillators with opposite signs in their free Hamiltonians. The normal-mode structure is obtained analytically and the corresponding modal amplitudes determine the pattern of energy exchange between the two sectors. To bridge the discrete and semiclassical pictures, we introduce smooth envelope functions that provide a continuous effective description along the geometric variable. Numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space show that the two oscillators exchange quanta in an approximately out-of-phase manner, consistent with an effective conservation of $\langle n_x\rangle - \langle n_y\rangle$. The reduced entropy $S_x(t)$ exhibits periodic growth, indicating entanglement generation. These results demonstrate that even a minimal two-mode framework can capture key qualitative features of energy transfer and information flow during evaporation.</description>

      <title>Spectral Codes: A Geometric Formalism for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new geometric perspective on quantum error correction based on spectral triples in noncommutative geometry. In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code. We further interpret Berezin Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code and briefly discuss implications for holographic quantum error correction. Overall, our results suggest that quantum error correction can be viewed as a universal low energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry.</description>

      <title>Tropical symmetries of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19779v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms of cluster algebras and show that their induced action on the g-vectors can be realized by tropicalising their action on the homogeneous $\hat{y}$ (or $\mathcal{X}$) variables of a chosen initial cluster. This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively.
  As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\CC[\Gr(4,8)]$.</description>

      <title>Equation of State of Highly Asymmetric Neutron-Star Matter from Liquid Drop Model and Meson Polytropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified description of dense matter and neutron-star structure based on simple but physically motivated models. Starting from the thermodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases, we construct an equation of state for cold, catalyzed matter by combining relativistic fermion statistics with the liquid drop model of nuclear binding. The internal stratification of matter in the outer crust is described by $\beta$-equilibrium, neutron drip and a gradual transition to supranuclear matter. Short-range repulsive interactions inspired by Quantum Hadrodynamics are incorporated at high densities in order to ensure stability and causality. The resulting equation of state is used as input to the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, yielding self-consistent neutron-star models. We compute macroscopic stellar properties including the mass-radius relation, compactness and surface redshift that can be compared with recent observational data. Despite the simplicity of the underlying microphysics, the model produces neutron-star masses and radii compatible with current observational constraints from X-ray timing and gravitational-wave measurements. This work demonstrates that physically transparent models can already capture the essential features of neutron-star structure and provide valuable insight into the connection between dense-matter physics and astrophysical observables while they can also be used as easy to handle models to test the impact of more complicated phenomena and variations in neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral form factor (SFF) of the quadratic $R$-para-particle Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($R$-PSYK$_2$) model with various random matrix ensemble couplings. We generalize previous work on Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) couplings to all three Gaussian ensembles (GUE, GOE, GSE) and three circular ensembles (CUE, COE, CSE). Through analytical and numerical methods, we establish precise correspondences between GUE and CUE results, demonstrating their SFFs satisfy $\mathcal{K}_{\text{GUE}}(2t) \approx \mathcal{K}_{\text{CUE}}(t)$ in the time regime $1 \ll t \ll N$. For the symplectic ensembles, we observe similar behavior with appropriate time rescaling, while we only provide the calculation method for the orthogonal ensembles.</description>

Abstract: In this note we explore the chaotic behavior of non-integrable QFTs and compare them to integrable ones. We choose as prototypes the double sine-Gordon and the sine-Gordon models. We analyze their discrete spectrum determined by a truncation method. We examine the map of the corresponding energy eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the random matrix theory (RMT) Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). This is done by computing the following properties: (a) The distribution of the adjacent spacings and their ratios (b) Higher order spacings and ratios (c) Pair correlations (d) Spectral form factors and (e) Spectral rigidity. For these properties we determine the differences between the integrable and non-integrable theories and verify that the former admits a Poisson behavior and the latter GOE (apart from the spectral rigidity).</description>

Abstract: The Abelian super Stueckelberg model (ASSM) in the Wess--Zumino (WZ) gauge is revisited, and the actual set of supersymmetric (SUSY) transformation is derived. In particular, we verified that the SUSY transformation of the super Stueckelberg sector compensates the gauge fixing condition imposed on the vector superfield, leading to a mix between the field components of both sectors. We also discuss the possibility to construct an extension of the ASSM with infinite self interacting terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a two-parameter family of flat-spacetime modes labeled by a deformation scale $\kappa$ and a phase angle $\gamma$, extending the $\kappa$-plane wave framework to include complex squeezing. The resulting $\kappa\gamma$ basis provides a globally well-defined mode decomposition whose associated vacuum $|0_{\kappa,\gamma}\rangle$ is a continuous-mode phase-squeezed state: $\kappa$ fixes the squeezing magnitude, while $\gamma$ sets the squeezing angle in phase space. We identify phase-induced particle creation, in which a relative phase mismatch $\Delta\gamma$ between observers generates a nontrivial particle spectrum governed by $(\kappa,\Delta\gamma)$ even when $\kappa$ is held fixed. We then derive the two reciprocal Bogoliubov maps: the $\kappa\gamma$ plane-wave operators in terms of $\kappa'$-Rindler operators, and conversely the $\kappa'$-Rindler operators in terms of $\kappa\gamma$ plane-wave operators, providing a closed algebraic bridge between these bases. Finally, by analyzing the Wightman function we show that $|0_{\kappa,\gamma}\rangle$ is globally regular, with no singularities beyond those of the standard Minkowski vacuum.</description>

Abstract: We quantize the Friedberg-Lee-Pang-Ren (FLPR) model within the framework of Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism. We construct the nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) charges using constraints and the fermionic gauge-fixing function by means of admissible gauge conditions. We also derive the BRST invariant effective action (and corresponding symmetries) of the model in both polar and Cartesian coordinates. We demonstrate that the physical states of the system are annihilated by the first-class constraints which is consistent with the Dirac formalism. Moreover, we establish the finite field-dependent BRST (FFBRST) symmetries of the FLPR model. We exhibit the interlink between the BFV-BRST gauge-fixed action and the classical gauge invariant action using FFBRST formulation.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement entropy for nonlocal field theories displays a universal ``volume law" scaling \cite{Barbon:2008ut, Karczmarek:2013xxa, Shiba:2013jja, Pang:2014tpa} as opposed to the ``area law" scaling for local field theories. The aim of this work is to determine whether complexity displays any such an universal scaling laws. The field theories considered here are obtained by deforming $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory by higher dimension operators introducing nonlocality, namely a dipole deformation and noncommutativity (NCSYM) by turning on world volume Kalb-Ramond $B$ field. The dual gravity backgrounds have a running dilaton, in addition to the $B$-field background, which alter AdS asymptotics. Our results capture nonlocality in the hyperscaling behavior for complexity. We also compute the subregion complexity which display phase transitions in the nonlocal field theories with the transition point being the same as that for the phase transition of entanglement entropy \cite{Karczmarek:2013xxa}. These new results dovetail nicely with our findings from our previous works \cite{Chakraborty:2020fpt, Katoch:2022hdf, Bhattacharyya:2022ren} on other lower dimensional nonlocal field theories such as little string theories (LSTs) and warped conformal field theories (WCFTs).</description>

      <title>Holographic Cosmology at Finite Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Cauchy Slice Holography in de Sitter spacetime. By performing a $T^2$ deformation of a (bottom-up) dS/CFT model, we obtain a holographic theory living on flat Cauchy slices of de Sitter, for which time is an emergent dimension, associated with an RG flow. In this $T^2$-deformed field theory, the dS/CFT is an IR fixed point rather than a UV fixed point, potentially affecting discussions of naturalness. As in the case of AdS/CFT, the terms in the $T^2$ deformation depend on the dimension and the bulk matter sector; in this article we consider gravity, plus optionally a scalar field of arbitrary mass. We compute scalar and graviton two-point correlation functions in the deformed boundary theory, and demonstrate precise agreement with finite-time wavefunction coefficients, which we calculate independently on the bulk side. The results are analytic in the scalar field dimension $\Delta$, and may therefore be continued to arbitrary generic values, including the principal series. Although many aspects of the calculations are similar to the AdS/CFT case, some new features arise due to the complex phases which appear in cosmology. Our calculations confirm previous expectations that the holographic counterterms are purely imaginary, when expressed in terms of wavefunction coefficients. But cosmological correlators, calculated by the Born rule, are shifted in a more complicated and nonlinear way.</description>

      <title>Residue sums for superconformal indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study superconformal indices of four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theories with $\mathcal{N}=1,2,4$ supersymmetry. The usual representation of a gauge theory index involves multiple contour integrals and reflects the BPS spectrum at zero Yang-Mills coupling. To find an alternative, closed form expression, it is natural to attempt an evaluation of the integrals through residues. However, the presence of non-isolated essential singularities prevents a straightforward evaluation. We show how this difficulty can be resolved by fixing the residual Weyl symmetry of the integral. This allows us to evaluate the residue sums for superconformal indices of $SU(2)$ gauge theories in terms of basic and elliptic hypergeometric series. For the Macdonald index of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(2)$ super Yang--Mills theory, we show how known transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series can be used to simplify the residue sum. We observe that the simplified form encodes features of the BPS spectrum at non-zero coupling and suggests the absence of fortuitous or non-graviton operators in the Macdonald sector. Furthermore, we evaluate the residue sums for the Macdonald and full superconformal indices of a general class of $SU(2)$ gauge theories. In the process, we find various applications to the theory of basic and elliptic hypergeometric integrals, including a convergent residue sum for Spiridonov's elliptic beta integral. Finally, we discuss the generalization of our method to higher rank gauge groups and evaluate the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(3)$ Macdonald index in closed form.</description>

Abstract: Here we investigate analytical properties of Weyl fermions in (2+1)-dimensional Lifshitz spacetimes. In particular, we are interested in obtaining geometric phases and verifying the existence of well-behaved fermionic zero modes. Using the Dirac phase method, we show how geometric phases naturally arise from the coupling between the fermionic fields and the Lifshitz geometry. We also present exact solutions of the zero modes by rewriting the Weyl equation as a system of supersymmetric equations.</description>

      <title>Monodromy Defects in Maximally Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories from Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three Type II supergravity solutions holographically dual to codimension-2 supersymmetric defects in $(p+1)$-dimensional SU($N$) maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory ($p=2,3,4$). In all of these cases, the defects have a non-trivial monodromy for the maximal abelian subgroup for the SO($9-p$) R-symmetry. Such solutions are obtained by considering branes wrapping spindle configurations, changing the parameters (which alters the coordinate domain), and imposing suitable boundary conditions. We provide a prescription to compute the entanglement entropy of the effective theory on the defect. We find the resulting quantity to be proportional to the free energy of the ambient theory. A similar analysis is performed for the D5-brane wrapping a spindle, but we find that changing the coordinate domain does not lead to a defect solution, but rather to a circle compactification.</description>

Abstract: We study the correlation functions between the dynamical variables and between their conjugate momenta at sites of a harmonic lattice in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. We show that at the thermodynamic limit, they can be expressed in terms of Lauricella's C-type hypergeometric series. Furthermore, using these expressions, we explicitly demonstrate that the correlators near the center of the lattice satisfying Diriclet boundary conditions coincide with those for the lattice with the periodic boundary conditions. By utilizing these expressions, we expect to make it easier to create programs that compute fast and highly precise for the quantum information quantities of subsystems within lattices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact localization result for the expectation value of the $1\over 2$ BPS circular Wilson loop in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory is given in the planar limit by the famous Bessel function expression: $\langle W\rangle = {2N\over \sqrt \lambda } I_1 ( \sqrt \lambda)$. Expanded in large $\lambda$ and expressed in terms of the AdS$_5 \times $S$^5$ string tension $T= {\sqrt \lambda \over 2\pi}$ this gives $\langle W\rangle = {\sqrt T\over 2\pi g_s} e^{2\pi T} (1- {3\over 16 \pi} T^{-1} + ...)$.The exponential is matched by the value of the action of the string with the AdS$_2$ world volume while the prefactor comes from the 1-loop GS string correction. Here we address the question of how the subleading $T^{-1}$ term could be reproduced by the 2-loop correction in the corresponding partition function of the AdS$_5 \times $S$^5$ GS string expanded near the AdS$_2$ minimal surface. We find that the string correction contains a non-zero UV logarithmic divergence implying that comparison with the SYM result requires a particular subtraction prescription. We discuss implications of this conclusion for checking the AdS/CFT duality at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>The CFT Distance Conjecture and Tensionless String Limits in $\mathcal N=2$ Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of infinite-distance limits on (complex) multi-dimensional conformal manifolds of 4d SCFTs and their bulk interpretation as tensionless-string limits in AdS/CFT. In particular, we focus on 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU$ quiver gauge theories with hypermultiplets in the bifundamental and fundamental representations. In the overall-free limit, we compute the large-$N$ Hagedorn temperature $T_H$, which governs the stringy exponential growth of the density of states at high energies. We argue that this quantity determines the type of stringy ultraviolet completion in the bulk: it captures the type of string theory in which the bulk physics is embedded while remaining insensitive to detailed geometric data. For linear quivers, we find that $T_H$ depends only on the quiver length, which is tied to the number of NS5-branes in the underlying brane construction and, in turn, to the string theory in which the bulk is embedded. For holographic quivers, where we impose that the two central charges $a$ and $c$ coincide in the large-$N$ limit, we show that $T_H$ coincides with that of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, which befits the 10d Type IIB description of their gravitational duals. We also analyze the exponential rate $\alpha$, which controls how the leading tower of higher-spin currents becomes conserved in these limits, as suggested by the CFT Distance Conjecture. In the large-$N$ regime, we derive sharp bounds on the minimal rate, $1/\sqrt{2}\le \alpha_{\min}\le \sqrt{2/3}$, attained in the overall-free limit. Moreover, we prove that the universal lower bound $\alpha\ge 1/\sqrt{2}$ holds, including at finite $N$. Finally, we go beyond the overall-free ray by characterizing the convex hull of the $\vec{\alpha}$-vectors that encode the exponential rate of the higher-spin towers along any (partial) weak-coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetries of the anisotropic oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the Hamiltonian of an $n$-dimensional isotropic oscillator admits an $SU(n)$ symmetry, making the system maximally superintegrable. However, the dynamical symmetries of the anisotropic oscillator are much more subtle. We introduce a novel set of canonical transformations that map an $n$-dimensional anisotropic oscillator to the corresponding isotropic problem. Consequently, the anisotropic oscillator is found to possess the same number of conserved quantities as the isotropic oscillator, making it maximally superintegrable too (commensurate case). The first integrals are explicitly calculated in the case of a two-dimensional anisotropic oscillator and remarkably, they admit closed-form expressions.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Galilean and Carrollian limits of gravitational theories and application to higher derivative gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the seemingly different methods used to derive non-Lorentzian (Galilean and Carrollian) gravitational theories from Lorentzian ones are equivalent. Specifically, the pre-nonrelativistic and the pre-ultralocal parametrizations can be constructed from the gauging of the Galilei and Carroll algebras, respectively. Also, the pre-ultralocal approach of taking the Carrollian limit is equivalent to performing the ADM decomposition and then setting the signature of the Lorentzian manifold to zero. We use this uniqueness to write a generic expansion for the curvature tensors and construct Galilean and Carrollian limits of all metric theories of gravity of finite order ranging from the $f(R)$ gravity to a completely generic higher derivative theory, the $f(g_{\mu\nu},R_{\mu\nu\sigma \rho},\nabla_{\mu})$ gravity. We present an algorithm for calculation of the $n$-th order of the Galilean and Carrollian expansions that transforms this problem into a constrained optimization problem. We also derive the condition under which a gravitational theory becomes a modification of general relativity in both limits simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a rigorous mathematical justification for the relaxation time approximation (RTA) model. We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Besides, we provide a general statement on the non-analytical structures in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description. For hard interactions, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived modes. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenvalue spectrum of linearized collision operator leads to gapless branch-cuts. We note that particle mass and inhomogeneous perturbations would complicate the above-mentioned non-analytical structures.</description>

      <title>Achronal localization and representation of the causal logic from a conserved current, application to the massive scalar boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12699v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Only recently the concept of achronal localization has been developed as the adequate frame for the description of the localizability of a relativistic quantum mechanical system. Here covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method is applied to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. As (covariant) achronal localizations correspond one-to-one to (covariant) representations of the causal logic, thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly a covariant family of representations of the causal logic is derived from the stress-energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. The construction of an achronal localization from a conserved current relies on a version of the divergence theorem for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary. This result is stated and proved in this work.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. analyzing and summing charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</description>

      <title>Graph-Theoretic Analysis of $n$-Replica Time Evolution in the Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $n$-replica time evolution operator $\mathcal{U}_n(t)\equiv e^{\mathcal{L}_nt} $ for the Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (BGUE) using a graph-theoretic approach. We examine the moments of the generating operator $\mathcal{L}_n$, which governs the Euclidean time evolution within an auxiliary $D^{2n}$-dimensional Hilbert space, where $D$ represents the dimension of the Hilbert space for the original system. Explicit representations for the cases of $n = 2$ and $n = 3$ are derived, emphasizing the role of graph categorization in simplifying calculations. Furthermore, we present a general approach to streamline the calculation of time evolution for arbitrary $n$, supported by a detailed example of $n = 4$. Our results demonstrate that the $n$-replica framework not only facilitates the evaluation of various observables but also provides valuable insights into the relationship between Brownian disordered systems and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.</description>

      <title>From top quarks to enhanced quantum key distribution: A Framework for Optimal Predictability of Quantum Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of quantum measurements is a cornerstone of quantum information theory and a key resource for quantum technologies. Here, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying the predictability of measurements on a bipartite quantum system using error measures inherited from statistical learning theory: the Bayes risk and inference variance. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal measurement that minimizes the prediction error for any arbitrary observable and any two-qubit state. We establish a direct, quantitative link between the ability to surpass the fundamental limit of local unpredictability and the presence of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Additionally, by optimizing measurement choices according to the minimal Bayes risk, we propose a modified entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol achieving higher secure key rates than the standard BB84 protocol, demonstrating enhanced resilience to noise. We apply our framework in two scenarios: perfect Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and top-antitop quark pairs produced in high-energy colliders. Our work offers a novel perspective on quantum correlations, connecting statistical inference, fundamental quantum phenomena, and cryptographic applications.</description>

      <title>Cornell Interaction in the Two-body Pauli-Schr\"odinger-type Equation Framework: The Symplectic Quantum Mechanics Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum behavior of a quark-antiquark bound system under the influence of a magnetic field within the symplectic formulation of quantum mechanics. Employing a perturbative approach, we obtain the ground and first excited states of the system described by the Cornell potential, which incorporates both confining and non-confining interactions. After performing a Bohlin mapping in phase space, we solve the time-independent symplectic Pauli-Schr\"odinger-type equation and determine the corresponding Wigner function. Special attention is given to the observation of the confinement of the quark-antiquark, that is revealed in the phase space structure. Due to the presence of spin in the Hamiltonian, the results reveal that the magnetic field enhances the non-classicality of the Wigner function, signaling stronger quantum interference and a departure from classical behavior. The experimental mass spectra is used to estimate the intensity of the external field, leading to a value that is in order of the transient magnetic field measured in non-central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.</description>

      <title>Scaling Behaviors in Active Model B+ via the Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling behaviors of the active model B+ using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, based on the nonequilibrium effective action formulated via the Martin-Siggia-Rose path-integral formalism. We derive the $\beta$ functions for all couplings of the system in generic $d$ dimensions, revealing regulator independence in various contributions to the renormalization group (RG) flow at specific values for $d$. After identifying specific regions of the parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those obtained in its perturbative counterpart.</description>

      <title>Taming the dark photon production via a non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflationary production of massive dark photons with non-minimal couplings to gravity shows surprising growth at large momenta. These couplings appear in the effective low energy description of a more fundamental theory. We find that the growth is absent in explicit gauge invariant UV-complete models. Such completions are also free of "ghost" instabilities, which often appear in the effective models.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Atoms from Topological Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bound states of a massive scalar field around a topological star, and show that these are strictly normal modes. This yields a genuine gravitational atom, sharply distinguishing horizonless objects from black holes. We show that the modes are controlled by the field's Compton wavelength compared to the size of the star. When the Compton wavelength is large, the field forms a cloud with a hydrogen-like spectrum, while in the opposite regime it is localized along timelike trajectories. When the two scales are comparable the spectrum becomes richer, and we characterize it in detail allowing the field to carry electric charge and Kaluza--Klein momentum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electron Clouds near Black Holes: Black Atoms and Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum mechanical wavefunctions near highly curved spaces, i.e., black holes. By utilizing the formalism developed by DeWitt, we derive the Schr\"odinger equations in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole geometries. The quantum electron cloud for the "black hydrogen atom" - an electron trapped by black holes - is particularly studied. We solve the equations and find that black holes generally attract the wavefunctions, localizing them near the horizon where the electrons are most likely to be trapped. These results imply that not only classical objects but also the quantum material and even the chemical properties of the atoms are affected by strong gravity. We also discuss black hydrogen molecules composed of multi-centered Majumdar-Papapetrou black holes.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes inside anisotropic magnetized neutron stars: physical properties and potential observational imprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate wormhole-plus-neutron-star (WH+NS) systems supported by two scalar fields, allowing for both pressure anisotropy of the neutron fluid and magnetic field. In general, such WH+NS systems contain ghosts; however, these ghosts can be eliminated. We find that the wormhole remains traversable regardless of whether anisotropy of the neutron fluid and/or magnetic fields are included. In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry. For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\,M_\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the fluid anisotropy and the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Holonomy in Sagnac Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the influence of gravitational waves on a Sagnac interferometer formed by the interference of two counter-propagating beams traversing a closed spatial loop. In addition to the well-known Sagnac phase shift, we identify an additional contribution originating from a relative rotation in the polarization vectors. We formulate this effect as a gravitational holonomy associated to the internal Lorentz group. The magnitude of both effects is computed due to gravitational waves generated by a localized source far from the detector, at leading order in the inverse distance. For freely falling observers, the phase shift is zero and the polarization rotation becomes the dominant effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs at a lepton collider with polarised beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $\tau^+\tau^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information-theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the neutrino oscillation phase propagating along radial and non-radial paths in the Einstein$\text{-}$Hilbert$\text{-}$Bumblebee (EHB) gravity around global monopole field, by using the quantummechanical treatment, the expression of the corrected neutrino oscillation probability is obtained. Our results show that neutrino oscillation in the EHB gravity around global monopole field is different from that in Schwarzschild black hole, the Lorentz-violating parameter $a$ mainly affects the peak of the oscillation probability, and the global monopole $\overline { \mu }$ and the lightest neutrino mass both affect the frequency of the oscillations of probabilities, which means that studying the neutrino oscillation phenomenon in curved spacetime may not only become a new technology for probing the properties of compact celestial bodies, but also help deepen our understanding of neutrinos.</description>
