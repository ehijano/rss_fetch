      <title>Deep Neural Networks can eliminate Spiral-wave Turbulence in Cardiac Tissue Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ventricular arrhythmias, like ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), precipitate sudden cardiac death (SCD), which is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialised world. Thus, the elimination of VT and VF is a problem of paramount importance, which is studied experimentally, theoretically, and numerically. Numerical studies use partial-differential-equation models, for cardiac tissue, which admit solutions with spiral- or broken-spiral-wave solutions that are the mathematical counterparts of VT and VF. In silico investigations of such mathematical models of cardiac tissue allow us not only to explore the properties of such spiral-wave turbulence, but also to develop mathematical analogues of low-amplitude defibrillation by the application of currents that can eliminate spiral waves. We develop an efficient deep-neural-network U-Net-based method for the control of spiral-wave turbulence in mathematical models of cardiac tissue. Specifically, we use the simple, two-variable Aliev-Panfilov and the ionically realistic TP06 mathematical models to show that the lower the correlation length {\xi} for spiral-turbulence patterns, the easier it is to eliminate them by the application of control currents on a mesh electrode. We then use spiral-turbulence patterns from the TP06 model to train a U-Net to predict the sodium current, which is most prominent along thin lines that track the propagating front of a spiral wave. We apply currents, in the vicinities of the predicted sodium-current lines to eliminate spiral waves efficiently. The amplitudes of these currents are adjusted automatically, so that they are small when {\xi} is large and vice versa. We show that our U-Net-aided elimination of spiral-wave turbulence is superior to earlier methods.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on adaptive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are surrounded by spatio-temporal patterns resulting from the interaction of the numerous basic units constituting natural or human-made systems. In presence of diffusive-like coupling, Turing theory has been largely applied to explain the formation of such self-organized motifs both on continuous domains or networked systems, where reactions occur in the nodes and the available links are used for species to diffuse. In many relevant applications, those links are not static, as very often assumed, but evolve in time and more importantly they adapt their weights to the states of the nodes. In this work, we make one step forward and we provide a general theory to prove the validity of Turing idea in the case of adaptive symmetric networks with positive weights. The conditions for the emergence of Turing instability rely on the spectral property of the Laplace matrix and the model parameters, thus strengthening the interplay between dynamics and network topology. A rich variety of patterns are presented by using two prototype models of nonlinear dynamical systems, the Brusselator and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Because many empirical networks adapt to changes in the system states, our results pave the way for a thorough understanding of self-organization in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits underlying spatiotemporal chaos in the Lugiato-Lefever model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain and investigate theoretically a broad family of stable and unstable time-periodic orbits-oscillating Turing rolls (OTR)-in the Lugiato-Lefever model of optical cavities. Using the dynamical systems tools developed in fluid dynamics, we access the OTR solution branches in parameter space and elucidate their bifurcation structure. By tracking these exact invariant solutions deeply into the chaotic region of the modulation instability, we connect the main dynamical regimes of the Lugiato-Lefever model: continuous waves, Turing rolls, solitons, and breathers, which completes the classical phase diagram of the optical cavity. We then demonstrate that the OTR periodic orbits play a fundamental role as elementary building blocks in the regime of the intracavity field transition from stable Turing rolls to fully developed turbulent regimes. Depending on the cavity size, we observe that the chaotic intracavity field driven by modulation instability displays either spatiotemporal or purely temporal intermittancy between chaotic dynamics and different families of the OTR solutions, exhibiting locally the distinctive wave patterns and large amplitude peaks. This opens avenues for a theoretical description of optical turbulence within the dynamical systems framework.</description>

      <title>Solitons with Self-induced Topological Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14919v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schrodinger equation supports solitons -- self-interacting, localized states that behave as nearly independent objects. We exhibit solitons with self-induced nonreciprocal dynamics in a discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This nonreciprocal behavior, dependent on soliton power, arises from the interplay between linear and nonlinear terms in the equations of motion. Initially stable at high power, solitons exhibit nonreciprocal instabilities as power decreases, leading to unidirectional acceleration and amplification. This behavior is topologically protected by winding numbers on the solitons' mean-field Hamiltonian and their stability matrix, linking nonlinear dynamics and point gap topology in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs), driven by periodic modulation of the $s$-wave scattering length. Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram that maps the competitive interplay between the unstable tongues of parametric resonance and the intrinsic Jeans instability. The diagram reveals that increasing the driving frequency compresses the Jeans-unstable region and allows well-separated parametric resonance tongues to dominate, thereby creating a clear regime for observing Faraday waves. Conversely, lowering the driving frequency expands the domain of Jeans instability, which fragments and overwhelms the parametric resonance structures. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal a characteristic transition from parametric-resonance-driven Faraday waves to gravity-dominated Jeans collapse as the Jeans frequency increases.</description>
