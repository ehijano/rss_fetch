      <title>Mechano-Bactericidal Surfaces Achieved by Epitaxial Growth of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechano-bactericidal (MB) surfaces have been proposed as an emerging strategy for preventing biofilm formation. Unlike antibiotics and metal ions that chemically interfere with cellular processes, MB nanostructures cause physical damage to the bacteria. The antibacterial performance of artificial MB surfaces relies on rational control of surface features, which is difficult to achieve for large surfaces in real-life applications. Herein, we report a facile and scalable method for fabricating MB surfaces based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) using epitaxial MOF-on-MOF hybrids as building blocks with nanopillars of less than 5 nm tip diameter, 200 nm base diameter, and 300 nm length. Two methods of MOF surface assembly, in-situ growth and ex-situ dropcasting, result in surfaces with nanopillars in different orientations, both presenting MB actions (bactericidal efficiency of 83% for E. coli). Distinct MB mechanisms, including stretching, impaling, and apoptosis-like death induced by mechanical injury are discussed with the observed bacterial morphology on the obtained MOF surfaces.</description>

      <title>Impact of pH and chloride content on the biodegradation of magnesium alloys for medical implants: An in vitro and phase-field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The individual contributions of pH and chloride concentration to the corrosion kinetics of bioabsorbable magnesium (Mg) alloys remain unresolved despite their significant roles as driving factors in Mg corrosion. This study demonstrates and quantifies hitherto unknown separate effects of pH and chloride content on the corrosion of Mg alloys pertinent to biomedical implant applications. The experimental setup designed for this purpose enables the quantification of the dependence of corrosion on pH and chloride concentration. The in vitro tests conclusively demonstrate that variations in chloride concentration, relevant to biomedical applications, have a negligible effect on corrosion kinetics. The findings identify pH as a critical factor in the corrosion of bioabsorbable Mg alloys. A variationally consistent phase-field model is developed for assessing the degradation of Mg alloys in biological fluids. The model accurately predicts the corrosion performance of Mg alloys observed during the experiments, including their dependence on pH and chloride concentration. The capability of the framework to account for mechano-chemical effects during corrosion is demonstrated in practical orthopaedic applications considering bioabsorbable Mg alloy implants for bone fracture fixation and porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. The strategy has the potential to assess the in vitro and in vivo service life of bioabsorbable Mg-based biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>Method for bioinspired electron bifurcation by semiconductor electrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron bifurcating enzymes oxidize a two-electron donor, pushing one electron thermodynamically uphill to reduce a low-potential acceptor by leveraging the downhill flow of the other electron to a high-potential acceptor. Electron bifurcation can achieve near 100\% energy conversion efficiency if operating in a near-reversible regime. Theories of charge transport and heterogeneous electron transfer reveal that bioinspired electron bifurcation is possible in tailored semiconductor electrochemical junctions: three-way n-p-electrolyte junctions. A two-electron species is oxidized at the semiconducting surface, injecting the resulting charges into the semiconductor. If the junction is properly configured, the electrons will spontaneously bifurcate into the n- and p-doped regions. If a bias is applied across these regions, the semiconductor-electrolyte junction will transduce energy by pushing half of the current to higher potential and half to lower potential. Energy wasting short circuit processes are be defeated using the carrier distributions and dynamics that occur naturally in these junctions. Furthermore, bifurcating junctions seem to require only fundamental electrochemical processes that have been observed in other contexts, and does not require fine-tuning of kinetic rate constants (although tuning may improve performance). Theory and simulation of bifurcating junctions reveals critical design principles and suggests that $\sim 100 \mu\text{A}/\text{cm}^2 - 1 \hspace{2 pt} m\text{A/cm}^2$ of bifurcated current is a reasonable goal for bifurcating junctions, but further enhancement seems possible.</description>

      <title>A ubiquitous transfer function links interacting elements to emerging property of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of complex systems, self-organization magnifies the compounding effects of element interactions by propagating, modifying, and enhancing functionality, ultimately leading to emergent system properties. The intricacies of self-organization make unveiling the elusive link between element interactions and emergent system properties akin to finding the proverbial Holy Grail. In the search for identifying a method to predict system-level properties, we used an inductive approach to bypass the self-organization. By observing drug interactions within biological complex system, system property, efficacy, emerged as a smooth response surface in the multi-dimensional space of drug-system interactions, which can be represented by the Complex System Response (CSR) function. This CSR function has been successfully validated across diverse disease models in cell lines, animals, and clinical trials. Notably, the CSR function reveals that biological complex systems exhibit second-order non-linearity. In this study, we generalized the CSR function to physical complex systems, linking maximum compressive yielding stress to impactful manufacturing parameters of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. Remarkably though anticipated, the CSR function reveals the connection between the macroscale system property (compressive yielding stress) and the microstructure during self-organizing process. In addition, the second-order non-linear CSR functions ensure a single global optimum in complex systems.</description>

      <title>How accurate is mechanobiology? A statistical test of cell force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanobiology is gaining more and more traction as the fundamental role of physical forces in biological function becomes clearer. Forces at the microscale are often measured indirectly using inverse problems such as Traction Force Microscopy because biological experiments are hard to access with physical probes. In contrast with the experimental nature of biology and physics, these measurements do not come with error bars, confidence regions, or p-values. The aim of this manuscript is to publicize this issue and to propose a first step towards a remedy therefor in the form of a general reconstruction framework. We also show that this opens the door to hypothesis testing of seemingly abstract experimental questions.</description>

      <title>An improved aerodynamic model for quasi-steady simulations of animal flight at moderate Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on experimental and numerical studies aimed at developing an improved paradigm to model animal flight at moderate Reynolds numbers ($ 20 k - 50k $). A series of experiments were performed to characterize the behaviors of aerodynamic forces and moment associated with a quasi-steady rectangular wing over a range of angle of attack, $\alpha$. We demonstrate that, while the drag coefficient curve, $C_D(\alpha)$, can be accurately modeled solely by a simple trigonometric function, the evolution of lift coefficient curve, $C_L(\alpha)$, is governed by the sum of trigonometric and exponential functions, where the latter captures the linear variation in lift coefficient within the small-angle regime, as predicted by the linear inviscid theory. In addition, we establish an empirical relation between the location of the center of pressure and $\alpha$, which can be used in conjunction with the proposed aerodynamic formulas (i.e., $C_L$ and $C_D$) to evaluate the pitching moment coefficient, $C_M(\alpha)$, about any arbitrary axis. These quasi-steady formulations are then utilized within a previously tested flapping-wing code to simulate the forward flight of a pigeon and a bat at various flight speeds, and the results are compared against previously reported experimental data. We successfully demonstrate that the proposed formulas yield much better agreement with wingbeat frequency for both animals, especially at higher flight speeds. In addition, the small-angle regime proves critical in offering higher $C_L/C_D$, leading to solutions with lower power consumption and body pitching variation, both of which are important aspects in designing future flapping wing robots.</description>

      <title>Efficient approximations of transcriptional bursting effects on the dynamics of a gene regulatory network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models of gene regulatory networks are widely used to study cell fate changes and transcriptional regulation. When designing such models, it is important to accurately account for sources of stochasticity. However, doing so can be computationally expensive and analytically untractable, posing limits on the extent of our explorations and on parameter inference. Here, we explore this challenge using the example of a simple auto-negative feedback motif, in which we incorporate stochastic variation due to transcriptional bursting and noise from finite copy numbers. We find that transcriptional bursting may change the qualitative dynamics of the system by inducing oscillations when they would not otherwise be present, or by magnifying existing oscillations. We describe multiple levels of approximation for the model in the form of differential equations, piecewise deterministic processes, and stochastic differential equations. Importantly, we derive how the classical chemical Langevin equation can be extended to include a noise term representing transcriptional bursting. This approximation drastically decreases computation times and allows us to analytically calculate properties of the dynamics, such as their power spectrum. We explore when these approximations break down and provide recommendations for their use. Our analysis illustrates the importance of accounting for transcriptional bursting when simulating gene regulatory network dynamics and provides recommendations to do so with computationally efficient methods.</description>

      <title>Mind the memory: Consistent time reversal removes artefactual scaling of energy dissipation rate and provides more accurate and reliable thermodynamic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.</description>
