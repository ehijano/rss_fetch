      <title>WildCap: Facial Appearance Capture in the Wild via Hybrid Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods achieve high-quality facial appearance capture under controllable lighting, which increases capture cost and limits usability. We propose WildCap, a novel method for high-quality facial appearance capture from a smartphone video recorded in the wild. To disentangle high-quality reflectance from complex lighting effects in in-the-wild captures, we propose a novel hybrid inverse rendering framework. Specifically, we first apply a data-driven method, i.e., SwitchLight, to convert the captured images into more constrained conditions and then adopt model-based inverse rendering. However, unavoidable local artifacts in network predictions, such as shadow-baking, are non-physical and thus hinder accurate inverse rendering of lighting and material. To address this, we propose a novel texel grid lighting model to explain non-physical effects as clean albedo illuminated by local physical lighting. During optimization, we jointly sample a diffusion prior for reflectance maps and optimize the lighting, effectively resolving scale ambiguity between local lights and albedo. Our method achieves significantly better results than prior arts in the same capture setup, closing the quality gap between in-the-wild and controllable recordings by a large margin. Our code will be released \href{https://yxuhan.github.io/WildCap/index.html}{\textcolor{magenta}{here}}.</description>

      <title>Text images processing system using artificial intelligence models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is to present a text image classifier device that identifies textual content in images and then categorizes each image into one of four predefined categories, including Invoice, Form, Letter, or Report. The device supports a gallery mode, in which users browse files on flash disks, hard disk drives, or microSD cards, and a live mode which renders feeds of cameras connected to it. Its design is specifically aimed at addressing pragmatic challenges, such as changing light, random orientation, curvature or partial coverage of text, low resolution, and slightly visible text. The steps of the processing process are divided into four steps: image acquisition and preprocessing, textual elements detection with the help of DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) model, BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) model that classifies detected textual elements, and the presentation of the results through a user interface written in Python and PyQt5. All the stages are connected in such a way that they form a smooth workflow. The system achieved a text recognition rate of about 94.62% when tested over ten hours on the mentioned Total-Text dataset, that includes high resolution images, created so as to represent a wide range of problematic conditions. These experimental results support the effectiveness of the suggested methodology to practice, mixed-source text categorization, even in uncontrolled imaging conditions.</description>

      <title>Particulate: Feed-Forward 3D Object Articulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Particulate, a feed-forward approach that, given a single static 3D mesh of an everyday object, directly infers all attributes of the underlying articulated structure, including its 3D parts, kinematic structure, and motion constraints. At its core is a transformer network, Part Articulation Transformer, which processes a point cloud of the input mesh using a flexible and scalable architecture to predict all the aforementioned attributes with native multi-joint support. We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences. Quantitative and qualitative results show that Particulate significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Moment-Based 3D Gaussian Splatting: Resolving Volumetric Occlusion with Order-Independent Transmittance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has reshaped novel view synthesis by enabling fast optimization and real-time rendering of high-quality radiance fields. However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.</description>

      <title>SOF: Sorted Opacity Fields for Fast Unbounded Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments - remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude. As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.</description>

      <title>Random-phase Wave Splatting of Translucent Primitives for Computer-generated Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for VR/AR systems but rely on advanced computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Conventional CGH typically generates smooth-phase holograms, limiting view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur, while severely under-utilizing the SLM space-bandwidth product. We propose Random-phase Wave Splatting (RPWS), a unified wave optics rendering framework that converts arbitrary 3D representations based on 2D translucent primitives into random-phase holograms. RPWS is fully compatible with modern 3D representations such as Gaussians and triangles, improves bandwidth utilization which effectively enlarges eyebox size, reconstructs accurate defocus blur and parallax, and leverages time-multiplexed rendering not as a heuristic for speckle suppression, but as a mathematically exact alpha-blending mechanism derived from first principles in statistics. At the core of RPWS are (1) a new wavefront compositing procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme for random-phase geometric primitives, ensuring correct color reconstruction and robust occlusion when compositing millions of primitives. RPWS departs substantially from the recent primitive-based CGH algorithm, Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS). Because GWS uses smooth-phase primitives, it struggles to capture view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur and under-utilizes the SLM space-bandwidth product; moreover, naively extending GWS to random-phase primitives fails to reconstruct accurate colors. In contrast, RPWS is designed from the ground up for arbitrary random-phase translucent primitives, and through simulations and experimental validations we demonstrate state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for next-generation near-eye displays.</description>

      <title>3D-LATTE: Latent Space 3D Editing from Textual Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate 3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods enabling high-fidelity and precise edits across a wide range of shapes and semantic manipulations.

      <title>Spec-Gloss Surfels and Normal-Diffuse Priors for Relightable Glossy Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remains a longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse and specular components, which restrict faithful material recovery and limit relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine environment map optimization accelerates convergence, and negative-only environment map clipping preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to existing Gaussian splatting methods.</description>
