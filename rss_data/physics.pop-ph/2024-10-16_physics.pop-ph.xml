      <title>Bell's inequality and the spooky actions at a distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses the main aspects related to Bell's inequality, both theoretical and experimental. A new derivation of Bell's inequality is also presented, which stands out for its mathematical simplicity. The exposition is mainly intended for undergraduate physics students, and places special emphasis on clarifying the meaning and scope of Bell's theorem in the context of the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen experiment.</description>

      <title>Hawking for everyone: Commemorating half a century of an unfinished scientific revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This year marks half a century since Stephen Hawking made his greatest scientific discovery by theoretically proving that black holes aint so black, as they behave like hot bodies with an absolute temperature that depends inversely on their mass. This discovery is expressed by a simple and elegant equation known as the Hawking temperature. The best way to commemorate this great scientific event is by bringing it to a wide audience. The simplest and most transparent and intuitive tool to achieve this goal is dimensional analysis. The objective of this work is to use this tool to derive the Hawking equation, reveal its meaning, and explore its main physical consequences.</description>

      <title>Black holes, Achilles and the original tortoise coordinate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "frozen star" picture of black holes, based on the fact that an outside observer will never see a collapsing sphere shrink sufficiently to form a black hole horizon, was a historical obstacle to the understanding of black holes, and continues to be a stumbling point for students trying to understand horizons. Promoting the discrete steps in Zeno's original story of Achilles and the tortoise to a "Zeno time coordinate" provides a quantitative toy model that allows students to understand why the "frozen star" phenomenon does not mean that objects cannot fall into a black hole. The toy model can be used for teaching about this particular feature of black holes in an introductory setting that does not introduce the Schwarzschild metric and its tortoise coordinates.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Beer Glass Shapes to Minimize Heat Transfer -- New Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the optimum shape for a beer glass that minimizes the heat transfer while the liquid is consumed, thereby keeping it cold for as long as possible. The proposed solution avoids the use of insulating materials. The glass is modeled as a body of revolution generated by a smooth curve, constructed from a material with negligible thermal resistance, but insulated at the base. The ordinary differential equation describing the problem is derived from the first law of Thermodynamics applied to a control volume encompassing the liquid. This is an inverse optimization problem, aiming to find the shape of the glass (represented by curve $S$) that minimizes the heat transfer rate. In contrast, the direct problem aims to determine the heat transfer rate for a given geometry. The solution obtained here is analytic, and the resulting function describing the relation between height ans radius of the glass, is in closed form, providing a family of optimal glass shapes that can be manufactured by conventional methods. Special attention is payed to the dimensions and the capacity of the resulting shapes.</description>

      <title>How much time do we have before catastrophic disclosure occurs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Claims of the retrieval of crashed craft and vehicles from non-human intelligences (NHI) abound in popular culture and the media. For this article, we utilize the number of such claims to estimate the number of years expected before the occurrence of a Catastrophic Disclosure, a term which was defined at the 2023 Sol Foundation's inaugural conference as the accidental disclosure of conclusive evidence of the existence of NHI, outside of the control of human institutions, such as governments and militaries. Here, we will consider one possible example of this as the crash of a piloted spacecraft (or, an ET probe) in the middle of a busy metropolis. The distribution of humans on Earth's surface, the population as a function of time, and the fraction of individuals owning smartphones, also versus time, are each taken into account as foundations for a rigorous statistical analysis. The author adopts a skeptical approach and doesn't claim NHI or ET are real but uses their analysis as an educational example of critical thinking and application of standard statistical distributions to an issue which captures the imagination of the public like almost no other issue. Making the extraordinary assumptions that sentient species other than humans exist, are capable of constructing vehicles for transportation, and are sufficiently fallible that their technology can malfunction, it is possible to quantify potential answers to the question of how long it will be before smartphone imagery or video proofs appear on the internet and become irrevocable through classification in the modern era. The results of simulations of numerous different potential scenarios, of varying degrees of pessimism/optimism, indicate that, if NHI/ETs is/are real, catastrophic disclosure may actually happen accidentally rather soon, with the mean expected year being 2040+/-20 under the default assumptions.</description>
