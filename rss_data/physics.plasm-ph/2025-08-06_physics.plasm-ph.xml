      <title>Control of cross-beam energy transfer through laser-plasma parameter adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) between two lasers is investigated through both analytical theory and two-dimensional simulations, with particular attention to its linear and nonlinear evolution under various laser-plasma conditions over timescales from several hundred picoseconds to one nanosecond. Based on the dispersion relation of stimulated Brillouin scattering driven by two laser beams, we obtain a laser frequency difference range within which CBET occurs. In the nonlinear regime, high harmonic of ion acoustic wave (IAW) leads to the reduction of saturation level at high laser intensities ($I\gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{W/cm^2}$). The wave breaking of harmonic IAW causes the second growth and final saturation of CBET. At low intensities, the linear saturation level slowly varies over time. Compared to Gaussian beams, smoothed lasers with speckles can mitigate CBET saturation level by reducing the effective overlap region. The maximum energy transfer is found at a frequency difference slightly smaller than the linear matching condition due to the reduction of IAW frequency induced by ion trapping. We find that the nonlinear behavior is sensitive to laser intensity, frequency difference, electron density, and ion temperature. The total energy transfer rate increases approximately linearly with laser intensity, underscoring its critical role in CBET control.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a laser filament-induced plasma in air at 10 kHz using optical emission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of high-power Yb-based ultrafast laser-amplifier systems has opened the possibility of air filamentation at high repetition rates &gt;1 kHz. In this new regime, accumulation effects cannot be ruled out, therefore, characterizing the plasma parameters and afterglow plasma-chemical kinetics becomes increasingly relevant. In this work, we use optical emission spectroscopy to measure nanosecond dynamics of gas temperature and electron temperature, species-specific decay times, and electron density of an atmospheric air laser filament produced by high average power femtosecond laser at a high repetition rate of 10 kHz. The molecular excitation mechanisms behind the nitrogen photoemissions are derived from vibrational distributions and temporal behavior of the studied emission bands. The presented diagnostic technique offers a complementary but more holistic measurement approach to optical probe schemes to characterize the laser-filament-induced plasma wake for high repetition rate filaments.</description>

      <title>Stationary Power-Law Solutions of Kinetic-Alfv\'{e}nic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave-kinetic description of weak kinetic-Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence based on the gyrokinetic theoretical framework is proposed. The wave kinetic equation describing kinetic Alfv\'{e}n wave spectral cascading via resonant three-wave interactions is derived, and the stationary spectra are analytically obtained using the Zakharov transformation in both the long-wavelength limit and the short-wavelength limit, for both counter-propagating and co-propagating cases. The cascade directions of stationary solutions are identified and their existence is further verified by numerical solution of the wave kinetic equation. A brief discussion on the relevance of such predictions to the solar wind turbulence and helical kinetic-Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence is presented.</description>

      <title>A Simple Model of Current Ramp-Up and Ramp-Down in Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple model of the ramp-up and ramp-down of the toroidal current in a tokamak plasma is developed. Faraday's law of electric induction is found to limit how rapidly the current can be safety ramped up or down. It is estimated that the minimum safe ramp-up/down times for the JET, SPARC, and ITER tokamaks are 4.2, 2.0, and 14.7 seconds, respectively. The JET ramp rate is in accordance with operational experience. The SPARC and ITER minimum safe ramp rates are less than the ramp rates in the respective designs. Hence, there is no indication that the design ramp rates are infeasible, as was recently suggested in arXiv:2507.05456 (2025). The typical ratios of the inductive electric field to the Connor-Hastie field in SPARC and ITER are found to be less than those in JET. Thus, the fact that the JET tokamak was able to operate successfully without encountering runaway electron problems during current ramps suggests that the future SPARC and ITER tokamaks should also be able to avoid such problems.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascade and Damping in Fast-Mode Compressible Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents hybrid and fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of fast-mode compressible turbulence. Turbulence damping at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales closely follows linear transit-time damping theory. Despite strong phase steepening, turbulence sustains robust cross-scale energy cascading. These findings resolve the long-standing question about the validity of classical wave theories in strongly nonlinear regimes and overturn the common presumption that wave steepening disrupts compressible turbulence cascade, thereby providing a more complete picture of MHD turbulence.</description>

      <title>Non-linear MHD modelling of shattered pellet injection in ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shattered pellet injection (SPI) is selected for the disruption mitigation system in ITER, due to deeper penetration, expected assimilation efficiency and prompt material delivery. This article describes non-linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of SPI in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak to test the mitigation efficiency of different injection parameters for neon-doped deuterium pellets using the JOREK code. The simulations are executed as fluid simulations, while additional marker particles are used to evolve the charge state distribution and radiation property of impurities based on OpenADAS atomic data, i.e., a collisional-radiative model is used. Neon fraction scans between 0 - 10% are performed. Numerical results show that the thermal quench (TQ) occurs in two stages. In the first stage, approximately half of the thermal energy is abruptly lost, primarily through convective and conductive transport in the stochastic fields. This stage is relatively independent of the neon fraction. In the second stage, where the majority of the remaining thermal energy is lost, radiation plays a dominant role. In case of pure deuterium injection, this second stage may not occur at all. A larger fraction ($\sim $20%) of the total material in the pellet is assimilated in the plasma for low neon fraction pellets ($\leq 0.12\%$) due to the full thermal collapse of the plasma occurring later than in high neon fraction scenarios. Nevertheless, the total number of assimilated neon atoms increases with increasing neon fraction. The effects of fragment size and penetration speed are then numerically studied, showing that slower and smaller fragments promote edge cooling and the formation of a cold front. Faster fragments result in shorter TQ duration and higher assimilation as they reach the hotter plasma regions quicker.</description>

      <title>Scenarios for magnetic X-point collapse in 2D incompressible dissipationless Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations of 2D incompressible dissipationless Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD), which couple the fluid velocity ${\bf V} = \wh{\sf z}\btimes\nabla\phi + V_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ with the magnetic field ${\bf B} = \nabla\psi\btimes\wh{\sf z} + B_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$, are known to support solutions that exhibit finite-time singularities associated with magnetic X-point collapse in the plane $(B_{x} = \partial\psi/\partial y, B_{y} = -\,\partial\psi/\partial x)$. Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four HMHD fields $(\phi,\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, which retains finite electron inertia, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.</description>

      <title>Continuum damping of topologically-protected edge modes at the boundary of non-uniformly magnetized cylindrical plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of recently discovered collisionlessly damped yet topologically protected surface plasma waves (TSPWs), from a simplified slab geometry to a cylindrical plasma-vacuum interface. A distinctive feature of these modes-emerging above the electron cyclotron frequency-is their collisionless damping, which arises from resonant coupling to a continuum of upper-hybrid modes localized within a smooth plasma-vacuum transition layer. We demonstrate both temporal and spatial damping of TSPWs at the boundary of a cylindrical magnetized plasma. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field, the TSPW exhibits a smooth and continuous transition, highlighting its topological robustness under magnetic inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Taking control of compressible modes: bulk viscosity and the turbulent dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many polyatomic astrophysical plasmas are compressible and out of chemical and thermal equilibrium, introducing a bulk viscosity into the plasma via the internal degrees of freedom of the molecular composition, directly impacting the decay of compressible modes, $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$. This is especially important for small-scale, turbulent dynamo processes in the interstellar medium, which are known to be sensitive to the effects of compression. To control the viscous properties of $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$, we perform trans-sonic, visco-resistive dynamo simulations with additional bulk viscosity $\nu_{\rm bulk}$, deriving a new $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ Reynolds number $\rm{Re}_{\rm bulk}$, and viscous Prandtl number $\rm{P}\nu \equiv \rm{Re}_{\rm bulk} / \rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$, where $\rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$ is the shear viscosity Reynolds number. We derive a framework for decomposing $E_{\rm mag}$ growth rates into incompressible and compressible terms via orthogonal tensor decompositions of $\nabla\otimes\mathbf{v}$, where $\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity. We find that $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$ play a dual role, growing and decaying $E_{\rm mag}$, and that field-line stretching is the main driver of growth, even in compressible dynamos. In the absence of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ ($\rm{P}\nu \to \infty$), $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$ pile up on small-scales, creating a spectral bottleneck, which disappears for $\rm{P}\nu \approx 1$. (abridged). We emphasize the importance of further understanding the role of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ in compressible astrophysical plasmas, which we estimate could be as strong as the shear viscosity in the cold ISM, and highlight that compressible direct numerical simulations without bulk viscosity have unresolved compressible mode dissipation scales.</description>
