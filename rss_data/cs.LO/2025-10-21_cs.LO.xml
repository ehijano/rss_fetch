      <title>Intuitionistic $j$-Do-Calculus in Topos Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize Pearl's do-calculus to an Intuitionistic setting called $j$-stable causal inference inside a topos of sheaves. Our framework is an elaboration of the recently proposed framework of Topos Causal Models (TCMs), where causal interventions are defined as subobjects. We generalize the original setting of TCM using the Lawvere-Tierney topology on a topos, defined by a modal operator $j$ on the subobject classifier $\Omega$. We introduce $j$-do-calculus, where we replace global truth with local truth defined by Kripke-Joyal semantics, and formalize causal reasoning as structure-preserving morphisms that are stable along $j$-covers. $j$-do-calculus is a sound rule system whose premises and conclusions are formulas of the internal Intuitionistic logic of the causal topos. We define $j$-stability for conditional independences and interventional claims as local truth in the internal logic of the causal topos. We give three inference rules that mirror Pearl's insertion/deletion and action/observation exchange, and we prove soundness in the Kripke-Joyal semantics. A companion paper in preparation will describe how to estimate the required entities from data and instantiate $j$-do with standard discovery procedures (e.g., score-based and constraint-based methods), and will include experimental results on how to (i) form data-driven $j$-covers (via regime/section constructions), (ii) compute chartwise conditional independences after graph surgeries, and (iii) glue them to certify the premises of the $j$-do rules in practice</description>

      <title>A Lazy, Concurrent Convertibility Checker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convertibility checking - determining whether two lambda-terms are equal up to reductions - is a crucial component of proof assistants and dependently-typed languages. Practical implementations often use heuristics to quickly conclude that two terms are or are not convertible without reducing them to normal form. However, these heuristics can backfire, triggering huge amounts of unnecessary computation. This paper presents a novel convertibility-checking algorithm that relies crucially on laziness and concurrency} Laziness is used to share computations, while concurrency is used to explore multiple convertibility subproblems in parallel or via fair interleaving. Unlike heuristics-based approaches, our algorithm always finds an easy solution to the convertibility problem, if one exists. The paper presents the algorithm in process calculus style and discusses its mechanized proof of partial correctness, its complexity, and its lightweight experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Higher-Order Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\lambda$-superposition calculus is a successful approach to proving higher-order formulas. However, some parts of the calculus are extremely explosive, notably due to the higher-order unifier enumeration and the functional extensionality axiom. In the present work, we introduce an "optimistic" version of $\lambda$-superposition that addresses these two issues. Specifically, our new calculus delays explosive unification problems using constraints stored along with the clauses, and it applies functional extensionality in a more targeted way. The calculus is sound and refutationally complete with respect to a Henkin semantics. We have yet to implement it in a prover, but examples suggest that it will outperform, or at least usefully complement, the original $\lambda$-superposition calculus.</description>

Abstract: We introduce $\lambda$KBO and $\lambda$LPO, two variants of the Knuth-Bendix order (KBO) and the lexicographic path order (LPO) designed for use with the $\lambda$-superposition calculus.

      <title>Basis-Sensitive Quantum Typing via Realisability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $\lambda_B$, a quantum-control $\lambda$-calculus that refines previous basis-sensitive systems by allowing abstractions to be expressed with respect to arbitrary -- possibly entangled -- bases. Each abstraction and let construct is annotated with a basis, and a new basis-dependent substitution governs the decomposition of value distributions. These extensions preserve the expressive power of earlier calculi while enabling finer reasoning about programs under basis changes. A realisability semantics connects the reduction system with the type system, yielding a direct characterisation of unitary operators and ensuring safety by construction. From this semantics we derive a validated family of typing rules, forming the foundation of a type-safe quantum programming language. We illustrate the expressive benefits of $\lambda_B$ through examples such as Deutsch's algorithm and quantum teleportation, where basis-aware typing captures classical determinism and deferred-measurement behaviour within a uniform framework.</description>

      <title>Smart Contracts Formal Verification: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal verification entails testing software to ensure it operates as specified. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. They run on blockchain platforms and automatically enforce and execute the terms of an agreement when meeting predefined conditions. However, Smart Contracts, as software models, often contain notable errors in their operation or specifications. This observation prompts us to conduct a focused study examining related works published across various sources. These publications detail specifications, verification tools, and relevant experiments. Subsequently, this survey proposes an alternative formal verification based on description logic.</description>

      <title>Subject-Event Ontology Without Global Time: Foundations and Execution Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models (conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before - the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3) making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms (A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3) without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures, DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from different subjects).</description>

      <title>Computable universal online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al. (STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead, Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense. We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of inductive inference.</description>

      <title>Predicative Ordinal Recursion on the Constructive Veblen Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Leivant's work on absolute predicativism, Bellantoni and Cook in 1992 introduced a structurally restricted form of recursion called predicative recursion. Using this recursion scheme on the inductive structures of natural numbers and binary strings, they provide a structural and machine-independent characterization of the classes of linear-space and polynomial-time computable functions, respectively. This recursion scheme can be applied to any well-founded or inductive structure, and its underlying principle, predicativization, extends naturally to other computational frameworks, such as higher-order functionals and nested recursion.
  In this paper, we initiate a systematic project to gauge the computational power of predicative recursion on arbitrary well-founded structures. As a natural measuring stick for well-foundedness, we use constructive ordinals. More precisely, for any downset $\mathsf{A}$ of constructive ordinals, we define a class $\mathrm{PredR}_{\mathsf{A}}$ of predicative ordinal recursive functions that are permitted to employ a suitable form of predicative recursion on the ordinals in $\mathsf{A}$. We focus on the case that $\mathsf{A}$ is a downset of constructive ordinals below ${\phi}_{{\omega}}({0}) = \bigcup_{k=0}^{\infty} {\phi}_k({0})$, where $\{{\phi}_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ are the functions in the Veblen hierarchy with finite index. We give a complete classification of $\mathrm{PredR}_{\mathsf{A}}$ -- for those downsets that contain at least one infinite ordinal -- in terms of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy $\{\mathcal{E}_k\}_{k=2}^{\omega}$. In this way, we extend Bellantoni-Cook's characterization of $\mathcal{E}_2$ (the class of linear-space computable functions) to obtain a machine-independent and structural characterization of the entire Grzegorczyk hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Comparative Expressivity for Structured Argumentation Frameworks with Uncertain Rules and Premises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling qualitative uncertainty in formal argumentation is essential both for practical applications and theoretical understanding. Yet, most of the existing works focus on \textit{abstract} models for arguing with uncertainty. Following a recent trend in the literature, we tackle the open question of studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. To do so, we ground the uncertainty of arguments in their components, structured within rules and premises. Our main technical contributions are: i) the introduction of a notion of expressivity that can handle abstract and structured formalisms, and ii) the presentation of both negative and positive expressivity results, comparing the expressivity of abstract and structured models of argumentation with uncertainty. These results affect incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks, and their extension with dependencies, on the abstract side, and ASPIC+, on the structured side.</description>

      <title>Formal Methods for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), communication is wireless and nodes can move independently. Properly analyzing the functional correctness, performance, and security of MANET protocols is a challenging task. A wide range of formal specification and analysis techniques have been employed in the analysis of MANET protocols. This survey presents an overview of rigorous formal analysis techniques and their applications, with a focus on MANET routing protocols. Next to functional correctness, also real-time properties and security are considered. Moreover, an overview is given of formal frameworks that target MANETs specifically, as well as mobility models that underlie performance analyses of MANET protocols. The aim is to give a comprehensive and coherent overview of this rather scattered field, in which a variety of rigorous formal methods have been applied to analyze different aspects of a wide range of MANET protocols.</description>

      <title>Constructive Ordinal Exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14542v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cantor's ordinal numbers, a powerful extension of the natural numbers, are a cornerstone of set theory. They can be used to reason about the termination of processes, prove the consistency of logical systems, and justify some of the core principles of modern programming language theory such as recursion. In classical mathematics, ordinal arithmetic is well-studied; constructively, where ordinals are taken to be transitive, extensional, and wellfounded orders on sets, addition and multiplication are well-known. We present a negative result showing that general constructive ordinal exponentiation is impossible, but we suggest two definitions that come close. The first definition is abstract and solely motivated by the expected equations; this works as long as the base of the exponential is positive. The second definition is based on decreasing lists and can be seen as a constructive version of Sierpi\'nski's definition via functions with finite support; this requires the base to have a trichotomous least element. Whenever it makes sense to ask the question, the two constructions are equivalent, allowing us to prove algebraic laws, cancellation properties, and preservation of decidability of the exponential. The core ideas do not depend on any specific constructive set theory or type theory, but a concrete computer-checked mechanization using the Agda proof assistant is given in homotopy type theory.</description>

      <title>A Unified Formal Theory on the Logical Limits of Symbol Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very "act" of connecting an internal symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.</description>

      <title>ATL*AS: An Automata-Theoretic Approach and Tool for the Verification of Strategic Abilities in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two novel symbolic algorithms for model checking the Alternating-time Temporal Logic ATL*, over both the infinite-trace and the finite-trace semantics. In particular, for infinite traces we design a novel symbolic reduction to parity games. We implement both methods in the ATL*AS model checker and evaluate it using synthetic benchmarks as well as a cybersecurity scenario. Our results demonstrate that the symbolic approach significantly outperforms the explicit-state representation and we find that our parity-game-based algorithm offers a more scalable and efficient solution for infinite-trace verification, outperforming previously available tools. Our results also confirm that finite-trace model checking yields substantial performance benefits over infinite-trace verification. As such, we provide a comprehensive toolset for verifying multiagent systems against specifications in ATL*.</description>

      <title>Monoidal closure of Grothendieck constructions via $\Sigma$-tractable monoidal structures and Dialectica formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the categorical structure of the Grothendieck construction $\Sigma_{\mathsf{C}}\mathsf{L}$ of an indexed category $\mathsf{L} \colon \mathsf{C}^{op} \to \mathsf{CAT}$. Our analysis begins with characterisations of fibred limits, colimits, and monoidal (closed) structures. The study of fibred colimits leads naturally to a generalisation of the notion of extensive indexed category introduced in CHAD for Expressive Total Languages, and gives rise to the concept of Left Kan extensivity, which provides a uniform framework for computing colimits in Grothendieck constructions.
  We then establish sufficient conditions for the (non-fibred) monoidal closure of the total category $\Sigma_{\mathsf{C}}\mathsf{L}$. This extends G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation and rests upon a new notion of $\Sigma$-tractable monoidal structure. Under this notion, $\Sigma$-tractable coproducts unify and extend cocartesian coclosed structures, biproducts, and extensive coproducts. Finally, we consider when the induced closed structure is fibred, showing that this need not hold in general, even in the presence of a fibred monoidal structure.</description>
