      <title>Spectral Analysis of Proton Eigenfunctions in Crystalline Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system with protons confined in a periodic potential is examined using the Schr\"odinger equation and the Bloch theorem. Real-world conditions introduce deviations from an ideal harmonic system due to truncated and non-quadratic potentials. The energy spectrum of bound eigenfunctions is derived, independent from the crystal momentum vector $\vec K$. Numerical solutions reveal intriguing structures in the system, including bound states with degeneracy equal to site number $N_w$ resembling a finite harmonic oscillator spectrum. Notably, the outcomes for protons differ from electronic energy bands due to proton mass, which results in a greater number of possible bound states. Building upon previous work, this study investigates the conditions for electromagnetic coherence onset in the system. The energy gap and oscillation amplitude constraints are demonstrated. A perturbation term accounts for deviations in energy level spacing, resulting in minor electromagnetic mode splitting. Maintaining a phase differential between modes below $\pi/2$ over an oscillation period is the condition for generating a negative energy coherent contribution in the interaction with the electromagnetic field. By analyzing the frequency dependence of the number of bound states, it is deduced that in a concrete example concerning hydrogen loading in metals within the octahedral phase the number of bound states is equal to 12, with an average frequency of 0.4 eV. This resolves the issue of unlimited energy gap and unbounded oscillation amplitude related to the coherent transition.</description>

      <title>The ALPHA-g experiment, the hunt for gravitational dipoles and the quantum vacuum as the source of gravity in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More recently, the ALPHA-g experiment has shown that antiatoms fall in the Earth's gravitational field like ordinary atoms, with the open possibility that antiatoms fall with a slightly lower acceleration. A possible lower acceleration of antiatoms (which could be revealed with two orders of magnitude higher precision measurements) would be an epoch-making discovery and a window to a new physics, suggesting among other things that quarks and antiquarks have gravitational charges of opposite sign. If gravitational charges of opposite sign exist, it implies the existence of virtual gravitational dipoles in the quantum vacuum, and opens up the possibility of including the quantum vacuum as an important source of gravity in the Universe.</description>

      <title>An intrinsic connection of space-time points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) describes the dynamics of quantum particles in the quantum realm in the Minkowski space-time, whereas the General Relativity (GR) is a classical theory describing the nature of dynamical behavior of large bodies in different space-times. This research is a proposal to the proof of concept that through the Einstein-Rosen bridge (also known as wormhole) the information can travel between two points %through quantum mechanical phenomenon, Hawking radiation thus proving the classical entanglement connection between two spatially distant points which are not causally connected. These results introduce the classical entanglement between the galactic black hole with its surrounding.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of a thermal-EM concentrator for enhancing EM signals and converging heat fluxes simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneously concentrating EM waves and heat fluxes to the same target region within an on-chip system carries substantial academic research importance and practical application value. Nevertheless, existing researches are primarily aimed at the design and experimentation of concentrators for individual EM waves or temperature fields. In this work, a thermal-EM concentrator, capable of simultaneously concentrating EM waves and heat fluxes, is designed using transformation optics/thermodynamics and fabricated with engineered EM-thermal metamaterials. The concentrating effects of the proposed thermal-EM concentrator on the thermal fluxes and EM waves are verified through numerical simulations and experimental measurements, respectively, which are in good agreement with each other. Both numerically simulated and experimentally measured results demonstrate the concentrating capability of the proposed thermal-EM concentrator, which can concentrate broadband TM-polarized EM waves ranging from 8-12 GHz and heat/cold flows to the same target region within an on-chip operating environment. The thermal-EM concentrator exhibits a thermal focusing efficiency close to 100% and more than three times enhancement of the magnetic field at the designed center frequency of 10 GHz. The proposed thermal-EM concentrator can be utilized for efficient cooling for the specified component and simultaneously enhancing the EM antenna's radiation/reception efficiency within an on-chip system.</description>

      <title>Study on data analysis for Ives-Stilwell-type experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13107v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ives-Stilwell experiment in 1938 was a historic experiment for confirming Einstein's special relativity, and various modern types have been repeated by use of laser technology. In this paper, we reveal and solve a long-lasting unrecognized fundamental issue that the data analysis for all those experiments was not consistent with Einstein's definition of the relativistic Doppler effect so that the Doppler effect was not actually confirmed. Based on existing data, we propose a justified data analysis and correctly confirm the Doppler effect in the Ives-Stilwell-type experiment, thus resulting in a great advance in the experimental verification of Lorentz invariance via the Doppler effect.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions to the Telegraph equation in terms of Airy functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two exact different solutions to the Telegraph equation in three-dimensional space are obtained in terms of Airy functions. As a result, these solutions unveil a distinctive propagation pattern along a coordinate that resembles a speed-cone-like coordinate of the system. This unique characteristic leads to effective Schr\"odinger-like equations, amenable to exact solutions through Airy functions.</description>
