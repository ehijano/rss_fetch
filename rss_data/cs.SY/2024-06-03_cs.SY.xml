      <title>Sensitivity Analysis for Piecewise-Affine Approximations of Nonlinear Programs with Polytopic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Programs (NLPs) are prevalent in optimization-based control of nonlinear systems. Solving general NLPs is computationally expensive, necessitating the development of fast hardware or tractable suboptimal approximations. This paper investigates the sensitivity of the solutions of NLPs with polytopic constraints when the nonlinear continuous objective function is approximated by a PieceWise-Affine (PWA) counterpart. By leveraging perturbation analysis using a convex modulus, we derive guaranteed bounds on the distance between the optimal solution of the original polytopically-constrained NLP and that of its approximated formulation. Our approach aids in determining criteria for achieving desired solution bounds. Two case studies on the Eggholder function and nonlinear model predictive control of an inverted pendulum demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Efficient Industrial Refrigeration Scheduling with Peak Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of industrial refrigeration systems across various sectors contribute significantly to global energy consumption, highlighting substantial opportunities for energy conservation through intelligent control design. As such, this work focuses on control algorithm design in industrial refrigeration that minimize operational costs and provide efficient heat extraction. By adopting tools from inventory control, we characterize the structure of these optimal control policies, exploring the impact of different energy cost-rate structures such as time-of-use (TOU) pricing and peak pricing. While classical threshold policies are optimal under TOU costs, introducing peak pricing challenges their optimality, emphasizing the need for carefully designed control strategies in the presence of significant peak costs. We provide theoretical findings and simulation studies on this phenomenon, offering insights for more efficient industrial refrigeration management.</description>

      <title>Optimization, guidance, and control of low-thrust transfers from the Lunar Gateway to low lunar orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gateway will represent a primary space system useful for the Artemis program, Earth-Moon transportation, and deep space exploration. It is expected to serve as a staging location on the way to the lunar surface. This study focuses on low-thrust transfer dynamics, from the Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit traveled by Gateway to a specified Low-altitude Lunar Orbit (LLO). This research addresses: (i) determination of the minimum-time low-thrust trajectory and (ii) design, implementation, and testing of a guidance and control architecture, for a space vehicle that travels from Gateway to LLO. Orbit dynamics is described in terms of modified equinoctial elements, in the context of a high-fidelity ephemeris model. The minimum-time trajectory from Gateway to a specified lunar orbit is detected through an indirect heuristic approach, which uses the analytical conditions arising in optimal control theory in conjunction with a heuristic technique. However, future missions will pursue a growing level of autonomy, and this circumstance implies the mandatory design of an efficient feedback guidance scheme, capable of compensating for nonnominal flight conditions. This research proposes nonlinear orbit control as a viable option for autonomous explicit guidance of low-thrust transfers from Gateway to LLO. This approach allows defining a feedback law that enjoys quasi-global stability properties without requiring any offline reference trajectory. The overall spacecraft dynamics is modeled including attitude control and actuation. The latter is demanded to an array of reaction wheels, arranged in a pyramidal configuration. Guidance, attitude control, and actuation are implemented in an iterative scheme. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the guidance and control architecture is effective with random starting points from Gateway and the temporary unavailability of the propulsion system.</description>

      <title>Contingency-Aware Station-Keeping Control of Halo Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to perform fuel-optimal stationkeeping for spacecraft in unstable halo orbits with additional constraints to ensure safety in the event of a control failure. We formulate a convex trajectory-optimization problem to generate impulsive spacecraft maneuvers to loosely track a halo orbit using a receding-horizon controller. Our solution also provides a safe exit strategy in the event that propulsion is lost at any point in the mission. We validate our algorithm in simulations of the three-body Earth-Moon and Saturn-Enceladus systems, demonstrating both low total delta-v and a safe contingency plan throughout the mission.</description>

      <title>Equivalent External Noise Temperature of Time-Varying Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equivalent external noise temperature of time-varying antennas is studied using the concept of cross-frequency effective aperture, which quantifies the intermodulation conversion of external noise across the frequency spectrum into a receiver's operational bandwidth. The theoretical tools for this approach are laid out following the classical method for describing external noise temperature of linear time-invariant antennas, with generalizations made along the way to capture the effects of time-varying components or materials. The results demonstrate the specific ways that a time-varying system's noise characteristics are dependent on its cross-frequency effective aperture and the broadband noise environment. The general theory is applied to several examples, including abstract models of hypothetical systems, antennas integrated with parametric amplification, and time-modulated arrays.</description>

      <title>Stability-Constrained Learning for Frequency Regulation in Power Grids with Variable Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of converter-based renewable generation has resulted in faster frequency dynamics, and low and variable inertia. As a result, there is a need for frequency control methods that are able to stabilize a disturbance in the power system at timescales comparable to the fast converter dynamics. This paper proposes a combined linear and neural network controller for inverter-based primary frequency control that is stable at time-varying levels of inertia. We model the time-variance in inertia via a switched affine hybrid system model. We derive stability certificates for the proposed controller via a quadratic candidate Lyapunov function. We test the proposed control on a 12-bus 3-area test network, and compare its performance with a base case linear controller, optimized linear controller, and finite-horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Our proposed controller achieves faster mean settling time and over 50% reduction in average control cost across $100$ inertia scenarios compared to the optimized linear controller. Unlike LQR which requires complete knowledge of the inertia trajectories and system dynamics over the entire control time horizon, our proposed controller is real-time tractable, and achieves comparable performance to LQR.</description>

      <title>A case study comparing both stochastic and worst-case robust control co-design under different control structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20496v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As uncertainty considerations become increasingly important aspects of concurrent plant and control optimization, it is imperative to identify and compare the impact of uncertain control co-design (UCCD) formulations on their associated solutions. While previous work developed the theory for various UCCD formulations, their implementation, along with an in-depth discussion of the structure of UCCD problems, implicit assumptions, method-dependent considerations, and practical insights, is currently missing from the literature. Therefore, in this study, we address some of these limitations by focusing on UCCD formulations, with an emphasis on optimal control structures, and uncertainty propagation techniques. Specifically, we propose three optimal control structures for UCCD problems: (i) open-loop multiple-control (OLMC), (ii) multi-stage control (MSC), and (iii) open-loop single-control (OLSC). Stochastic in expectation UCCD (SE-UCCD) and worst-case robust UCCD (WCR-UCCD) formulations, which are motivated by probabilistic and crisp representations of uncertainties, respectively, are implemented for a simplified strain-actuated solar array case study. Solutions to the OLMC SE-UCCD problem are obtained using two uncertainty propagation techniques: generalized Polynomial Chaos expansion (gPC) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The OLMC and MSC WCR-UCCD problems are solved by leveraging the structure of the linear program, leading to polytopic uncertainties. To highlight the importance of uncertainty in early-stage design, the closed-loop reference-tracking response of the systems is also investigated. Insights from such studies underscore the role of the control structure in managing the trade-offs between risk and performance, as well as meeting problem requirements. The results also emphasize the benefits of efficient uncertainty propagation techniques for dynamic optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Reach-Avoid Control Synthesis for a Quadrotor UAV with Formal Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reach-avoid specifications are one of the most common tasks in autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. Despite the intensive research and development associated with control of aerial vehicles, generating feasible trajectories though complex environments and tracking them with formal safety guarantees remain challenging. In this paper, we propose a control framework for a quadrotor UAV that enables accomplishing reach-avoid tasks with formal safety guarantees. In this proposed framework, we integrate geometric control theory for tracking and polynomial trajectory generation using Bezier curves, where tracking errors are accounted for in the trajectory synthesis process. To estimate the tracking errors, we revisit the stability analysis of the closed-loop quadrotor system, when geometric control is implemented. We show that the tracking error dynamics exhibit local exponential stability when geometric control is implemented with any positive control gains, and we derive tight uniform bounds of the tracking error. We also introduce sufficient conditions to be imposed on the desired trajectory utilizing the derived uniform bounds to ensure the well-definedness of the closed-loop system. For the trajectory synthesis, we present an efficient algorithm that enables constructing a safe tube by means of sampling-based planning and safe hyper-rectangular set computations. Then, we compute the trajectory, given as a piecewise continuous Bezier curve, through the safe tube, where a heuristic efficient approach that utilizes iterative linear programming is employed. We present extensive numerical simulations with a cluttered environment to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reach-avoid planning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Implementation of Explicit Reference Governor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit reference governor (ERG) is an add-on unit that provides constraint handling capability to pre-stabilized systems. The main idea behind ERG is to manipulate the derivative of the applied reference in continuous time such that the satisfaction of state and input constraints is guaranteed at all times. However, ERG should be practically implemented in discrete-time. This paper studies the discrete-time implementation of ERG, and provides conditions under which the feasibility and convergence properties of the ERG framework are maintained when the updates of the applied reference are performed in discrete time. The proposed approach is validated via extensive simulation and experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Excitable crawling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze the suitability of a spiking controller to engineer the locomotion of a soft robotic crawler. Inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of neural excitability, we design a bistable controller with an electrical flipflop circuit representation capable of generating spikes on-demand when coupled to the passive crawler mechanics. A proprioceptive sensory signal from the crawler mechanics turns bistability of the controller into a rhythmic spiking. The output voltage, in turn, activates the crawler's actuators to generate movement through peristaltic waves. We show through geometric analysis that this control strategy achieves endogenous crawling. The electro-mechanical sensorimotor interconnection provides embodied negative feedback regulation, facilitating locomotion. Dimensional analysis provides insights on the characteristic scales in the crawler's mechanical and electrical dynamics, and how they determine the crawling gait. Adaptive control of the electrical scales to optimally match the mechanical scales can be envisioned to achieve further efficiency, as in homeostatic regulation of neuronal circuits. Our approach can scale up to multiple sensorimotor loops inspired by biological central pattern generators.</description>

      <title>Impact of Phase Selection on Accuracy and Scalability in Calculating Distributed Energy Resources Hosting Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hosting capacity (HC) and dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs), defined as dynamic, time-varying HC, are calculated using three-phase optimal power flow (OPF) formulations. Due to the computational complexity of such optimisation problems, HC and DOE are often calculated by introducing certain assumptions and approximations, including the linearised OPF formulation, which we implement in the Python-based tool ppOPF. Furthermore, we investigate how assumptions of the distributed energy resource (DER) connection phase impact the objective function value and computational time in calculating HC and DOE in distribution networks of different sizes. The results are not unambiguous and show that it is not possible to determine the optimal connection phase without introducing binary variables since, no matter the case study, the highest objective function values are calculated with mixed integer OPF formulations. The difference is especially visible in a real-world low-voltage network in which the difference between different scenarios is up to 14 MW in a single day. However, binary variables make the problem computationally complex and increase computational time to several hours in the DOE calculation, even when the optimality gap different from zero is set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DC networks play an important role within the ongoing energy transition. In this context, simulations of designed and existing networks and their corresponding assets are a core tool to get insights and form a support to decision-making. Hereby, these simulations of DC networks are executed in the time domain. Due to the involved high frequencies and the used controllers, the equations that model these DC networks are stiff and highly oscillatory differential equations. By exploiting sparsity, we show that conventional adaptive time stepping schemes can be used efficiently for the time domain simulation of very large DC networks and that this scales linearly in the computational cost as the size of the networks increase.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Microgrid Formation Considering Time-dependent Contingency: A Distributionally Robust Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events has posed significant risks to the operation of power grids. During long-duration extreme weather events, microgrid formation (MF) is an essential solution to enhance the resilience of the distribution systems by proactively partitioning the distribution system into several microgrids to mitigate the impact of contingencies. This paper proposes a distributionally robust dynamic microgrid formation (DR-DMF) approach to fully consider the temporal characteristics of line failure probability during long-duration extreme weather events like typhoons. The boundaries of each microgrid are dynamically adjusted to enhance the resilience of the system. Furthermore, the expected load shedding is minimized by a distributionally robust optimization model considering the uncertainty of line failure probability regarding the worst-case distribution of contingencies. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by numerical simulations on a modified IEEE 37-node system.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Sensor Reporting Scheduling for Non-linear Dynamic System Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communication (GoC) is a form of semantic communication where the effectiveness of information transmission is measured by its impact on achieving the desired goal. In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), GoC can make IoT sensors to selectively transmit data pertinent to the intended goals of the receiver. Therefore, GoC holds significant value for IoT networks as it facilitates timely decision-making at the receiver, reduces network congestion, and enhances spectral efficiency. In this paper, we consider a scenario where an edge node polls sensors monitoring the state of a non-linear dynamic system (NLDS) to respond to the queries of several clients. Our work delves into the foregoing GoC problem, which we term goal-oriented scheduling (GoS). Our proposed GoS utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with meticulously devised action space, state space, and reward function. The devised action space and reward function play a pivotal role in reducing the number of sensor transmissions. Meanwhile, the devised state space empowers our DRL scheduler to poll the sensor whose observation is expected to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the query responses. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed GoS can either effectively minimize the query response MSE further or obtain a resembling MSE compared to benchmark scheduling methods, depending on the type of query. Furthermore, the proposed GoS proves to be energy-efficient for the sensors and of lower complexity compared to benchmark scheduling methods.</description>

      <title>Quality of Non-Convergent Best Response Processes in Multi-Agent Systems through Sink Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Examining the behavior of multi-agent systems is vitally important to many emerging distributed applications - game theory has emerged as a powerful tool set in which to do so. The main approach of game-theoretic techniques is to model agents as players in a game, and predict the emergent behavior through the relevant Nash equilibrium. The virtue from this viewpoint is that by assuming that self-interested decision-making processes lead to Nash equilibrium, system behavior can then be captured by Nash equilibrium without studying the decision-making processes explicitly. This approach has seen success in a wide variety of domains, such as sensor coverage, traffic networks, auctions, and network coordination. However, in many other problem settings, Nash equilibrium are not necessarily guaranteed to exist or emerge from self-interested processes. Thus the main focus of the paper is on the study of sink equilibrium, which are defined as the attractors of these decision-making processes. By classifying system outcomes through a global objective function, we can analyze the resulting approximation guarantees that sink equilibrium have for a given game. Our main result is an approximation guarantee on the sink equilibrium through defining an introduced metric of misalignment, which captures how uniform agents are in their self-interested decision making. Overall, sink equilibrium are naturally occurring in many multi-agent contexts, and we display our results on their quality with respect to two practical problem settings.</description>

Abstract: Efficient utilization of satellite resources in dynamic environments remains a challenging problem in satellite scheduling. This paper addresses the multi-satellite collection scheduling problem (m-SatCSP), aiming to optimize task scheduling over a constellation of satellites under uncertain conditions such as cloud cover. Leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a stochastic search algorithm, two versions of MCTS are explored to schedule satellites effectively. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize the algorithm's performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MCTS approach, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and efficiency. Comparative analysis against other scheduling algorithms showcases competitive performance, positioning MCTS as a promising solution for satellite task scheduling in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Design, Calibration, and Control of Compliant Force-sensing Gripping Pads for Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a pair of low-cost, light-weight and compliant force-sensing gripping pads used for manipulating box-like objects with smaller-sized humanoid robots. These pads measure normal gripping forces and center of pressure (CoP). A calibration method is developed to improve the CoP measurement accuracy. A hybrid force-alignment-position control framework is proposed to regulate the gripping forces and to ensure the surface alignment between the grippers and the object. Limit surface theory is incorporated as a contact friction modeling approach to determine the magnitude of gripping forces for slippage avoidance. The integrated hardware and software system is demonstrated with a NAO humanoid robot. Experiments show the effectiveness of the overall approach.</description>

      <title>Congestion-Aware Path Re-routing Strategy for Dense Urban Airspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing UAS Traffic Management (UTM) frameworks designate preplanned flight paths to uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS), enabling the UAS to deliver payloads. However, with increasing delivery demand between the source-destination pairs in the urban airspace, UAS will likely experience considerable congestion on the nominal paths. We propose a rule-based congestion mitigation strategy that improves UAS safety and airspace utilization in congested traffic streams. The strategy relies on nominal path information from the UTM and positional information of other UAS in the vicinity. Following the strategy, UAS opts for alternative local paths in the unoccupied airspace surrounding the nominal path and avoids congested regions. The strategy results in UAS traffic exploring and spreading to alternative adjacent routes on encountering congestion. The paper presents queuing models to estimate the expected traffic spread for varying stochastic delivery demand at the source, thus helping to reserve the airspace around the nominal path beforehand to accommodate any foreseen congestion. Simulations are presented to validate the queuing results in the presence of static obstacles and intersecting UAS streams.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Integer Optimal Control via Reinforcement Learning: A Case Study on Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many optimal control problems require the simultaneous output of discrete and continuous control variables. These problems are usually formulated as mixed-integer optimal control (MIOC) problems, which are challenging to solve due to the complexity of the solution space. Numerical methods such as branch-and-bound are computationally expensive and undesirable for real-time control. This paper proposes a novel hybrid-action reinforcement learning (HARL) algorithm, twin delayed deep deterministic actor-Q (TD3AQ), for MIOC problems. TD3AQ combines the advantages of both actor-critic and Q-learning methods, and can handle the discrete and continuous action spaces simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) energy management problem, where real-time control of the discrete variables, clutch engagement/disengagement and gear shift, and continuous variable, engine torque, is essential to maximize fuel economy while satisfying driving constraints. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that TD3AQ achieves control results close to optimality when compared with dynamic programming (DP), with just 4.69% difference. Furthermore, it surpasses the performance of baseline reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Different View of Sigma-Delta Modulators Under the Lens of Pulse Frequency Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06983v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fact that VCO-ADCs produce noise-shaped quantization noise suggests that a link between frequency modulation and Sigma-Delta modulation should exist. The connection between a VCO-ADC and a first-order Sigma-Delta modulator has been already explained using Pulse Frequency Modulation. In this paper, we attempt to extend the theory based on Pulse Frequency Modulation to a generic Sigma-Delta modulator. We show that this link between Sigma-Delta modulation and Pulse Frequency Modulation relies in a sampling invariance property that defines the equivalence between both entities. This novel point of view, allows to go beyond the white quantization noise model of a Sigma-Delta modulator, revealing the origin of some nonlinear phenomena. We first predict spurious tones which cannot be explained by circuit non linearity. Multi-bit and single bit modulators are shown to belong to a same generic class of systems. Finally, quantizer overload is analyzed using our model. The results are applied to Continuous-Time Sigma-Delta modulators of orders one, two and three and then extended to a generic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems are not entirely decomposable, hence interdependences arise at the interfaces in complex projects. When changes occur, significant risks arise at these interfaces as it is hard to identify, manage and visualise the systemic consequences of changes. Particularly problematic are the interfaces in which there are multiple interdependencies, which occur where the boundaries between design components, contracts and organisation coincide, such as between design disciplines. In this paper, we propose an approach to digital twin-based interface management, through an underpinning state-of-the-art review of the existing technical literature and a small pilot to identify the characteristics of future data-driven solutions. We set out an approach to digital twin-based interface management and an agenda for research on advanced methodologies for managing change in complex projects. This agenda includes the need to integrate work on identifying systems interfaces, change propagation and visualisation, and the potential to significantly extend the limitations of existing solutions by using developments in the digital twin, such as linked data, semantic enrichment, network analyses, natural language processing (NLP)-enhanced ontology and machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gain, received power bandwidth, transient characteristics, and signal fidelity of two time-varying electrically small antennas based on parametric amplifier design are studied using practical QAM signals. Results show that interference from the difference harmonic present in the response of degenerate-mode parametric amplification decreases its signal throughput relative to a reference linear time-invariant (LTI) receiver, despite its apparent increased received power bandwidth in the frequency domain. The analysis also demonstrates that a non-degenerate parametric receiver, lacking this detrimental effect, exhibits increased signal throughput over the reference LTI receiver.</description>

      <title>A Rolling Horizon Restoration Framework for Post-disaster Restoration of Electrical Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Severe weather events such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and large wind or ice storms can cause extensive damage to electrical distribution networks, requiring a multi-day restoration effort. Complicating the recovery process is the lack of complete and accurate information regarding the extent and locations of damages, at least during the initial part of the recovery process. These factors make workforce planning challenging. In this paper, we adopt a rolling horizon restoration framework whereby repairs are planned for adjustable finite length restoration windows. Considering both repair times as well as travel times, we show that the optimal scheduling problem with multiple crews, each with their own time budget, can be recast in terms of a cost constrained reward maximizing mTSP (traveling salesman problem) on doubly weighted graphs, where the objective is to maximize the aggregate reward earned during the upcoming restoration window, provided no crew violates its time budget and certain electrical continuity constraints are met. We propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for solving the above problem which is validated on standard IEEE PES test feeder networks.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Economic Dispatch with Flexible Loads and RES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain the supply-demand balance of power systems by solely relying on the generation side. To combat the volatility led by the uncertain RESs, demand-side management by leveraging the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) has been recognized as an economic and efficient approach. Thus, it is important to integrate MDF into existing power systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced day-ahead energy market, where the MDFs of aggregate loads are traded to minimize the generation cost and mitigate the volatility of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the transmission network. We first explicitly capture the negative impact of the uncertainty from RESs on the day-ahead market by a chance-constrained economic dispatch problem (CEDP). Then, we propose a bidding mechanism for the MDF of the aggregate loads and combine this mechanism into the CEDP for the day-ahead market. Through multiple case studies, we show that MDF from load aggregators can reduce the volatility of LMPs. In addition, we identify the values of the different flexibilities in the MDF bids, which provide useful insights into the design of more complex MDF markets.</description>

      <title>Robust Economic Dispatch with Flexible Demand and Adjustable Uncertainty Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With more renewable energy sources (RES) integrated into the power system, the intermittency of RES places a heavy burden on the system. The uncertainty of RES is traditionally handled by controllable generators to balance the real time wind power deviation. As the demand side management develops, the flexibility of aggregate loads can be leveraged to mitigate the negative impact of the wind power. In view of this, we study the problem of how to exploit the multi-dimensional flexibility of elastic loads to balance the trade-off between a low generation cost and a low system risk related to the wind curtailment and the power deficiency. These risks are captured by the conditional value-at-risk. Also, unlike most of the existing studies, the uncertainty set of the wind power output in our model is not fixed. By contrast, it is undetermined and co-optimized based on the available load flexibility. We transform the original optimization problem into a convex one using surrogate affine approximation such that it can be solved efficiently. In case studies, we apply our model on a six-bus transmission network and demonstrate that how flexible load aggregators can help to determine the optimal admissible region for the wind power deviations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven framework to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of a Koopman operator for approximating the state evolution of a dynamical system under noisy observations. To this end, our proposed solution has two main advantages. First, the proposed method only requires the measurement noise to be bounded. Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks. We further compare the presented method with similar methods proposed in the latest literature on Koopman learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important challenge in the online convex optimization (OCO) setting is to incorporate generalized inequalities and time-varying constraints. The inclusion of constraints in OCO widens the applicability of such algorithms to dynamic and safety-critical settings such as the online optimal power flow (OPF) problem. In this work, we propose the first projection-free OCO algorithm admitting time-varying linear constraints and convex generalized inequalities: the online interior-point method for time-varying equality constraints (OIPM-TEC). We derive simultaneous sublinear dynamic regret and constraint violation bounds for OIPM-TEC under standard assumptions. For applications where a given tolerance around optima is accepted, we employ an alternative OCO performance metric -- the epsilon-regret -- and a more computationally efficient algorithm, the epsilon-OIPM-TEC, that possesses sublinear bounds under this metric. Finally, we showcase the performance of these two algorithms on an online OPF problem and compare them to another OCO algorithm from the literature.</description>

      <title>Perimeter Control with Heterogeneous Metering Rates for Cordon Signals: A Physics-Regularized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perimeter Control (PC) strategies have been proposed to address urban road network control in oversaturated situations by regulating the transfer flow of the Protected Network (PN) based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). The uniform metering rate for cordon signals in most existing studies overlooks the variance of local traffic states at the intersection level, which may cause severe local traffic congestion and degradation of the network stability. PC strategies with heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals allow precise control for the perimeter but the complexity of the problem increases exponentially with the scale of the PN. This paper leverages a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based traffic signal control framework to decompose this PC problem, which considers heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals, into multi-agent cooperation tasks. Each agent controls an individual signal located in the cordon, decreasing the dimension of action space for the controller compared to centralized methods. A physics regularization approach for the MARL framework is proposed to ensure the distributed cordon signal controllers are aware of the global network state by encoding MFD-based knowledge into the action-value functions of the local agents. The proposed PC strategy is operated as a two-stage system, with a feedback PC strategy detecting the overall traffic state within the PN and then distributing local instructions to cordon signals controllers in the MARL framework via the physics regularization. Through numerical tests with different demand patterns in a microscopic traffic environment, the proposed PC strategy shows promising robustness and transferability. It outperforms state-of-the-art feedback PC strategies in increasing network throughput, decreasing distributed delay for gate links, and reducing carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Systematic Solutions to Login and Authentication Security Problems: A Dual-Password Login-Authentication Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Credential theft and remote attacks are the most serious threats to user authentication mechanisms. The crux of these problems is that we cannot control such behaviors. However, if a password does not contain user secrets, stealing it is useless. If unauthorized inputs are invalidated, remote attacks can be disabled. Thus, credential secrets and account input fields can be controlled. Rather than encrypting passwords, we design a dual-password login-authentication mechanism, where a user-selected secret-free login password is converted into an untypable authentication password. Subsequently, the authenticatable functionality of the login password and the typable functionality of the authentication password can be disabled or invalidated to prevent credential theft and remote attacks. Thus, the usability-security tradeoff and password reuse issues are resolved; local authentication password storage is no longer necessary. More importantly, the password converter acts as an open hashing algorithm, meaning that its intermediate elements can be used to define a truly unique identity for the login process to implement a novel dual-identity authentication scheme. In particular, the system-managed elements are concealed, inaccessible, and independent of any personal information and therefore can be used to define a perfect unforgeable process identifier to identify unauthorized inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the present work is to expand substantially the type of control and estimation problems that can be addressed following Schr\"odinger's dictum, by incorporating termination (killing) of stochastic flows. Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is, once again, available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</description>

      <title>Application based Evaluation of an Efficient Spike-Encoder, "Spiketrum"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.</description>

Abstract: Yoshimura origami is a classical folding pattern that has inspired many deployable structure designs. Its applications span from space exploration, kinetic architectures, and soft robots to even everyday household items. However, despite its wide usage, Yoshimura has been fixated on a set of design constraints to ensure its flat-foldability. Through extensive kinematic analysis and prototype tests, this study presents a new Yoshimura that intentionally defies these constraints. Remarkably, one can impart a unique meta-stability by using the Golden Ratio angle to define the triangular facets of a generalized Yoshimura. As a result, when its facets are strategically popped out, a ``Golden Ratio Yoshimura'' boom with $m$ modules can be theoretically reconfigured into $8^m$ geometrically unique and load-bearing shapes. This result not only challenges the existing design norms but also opens up a new avenue to create deployable and versatile structural systems.</description>
