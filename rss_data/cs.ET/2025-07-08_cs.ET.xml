      <title>A Survey on Integrating Quantum Computers into High Performance Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers use quantum mechanical phenomena to perform conventionally intractable calculations for specific problems. Despite being universal machines, quantum computers are not expected to replace classical computers, but rather, to complement them and form hybrid systems. This makes integrating quantum computers into high performance computing (HPC) systems an increasingly relevant topic. We present a structured literature review on the integration aspect. We methodologically search literature databases and manually evaluate 107 publications. These publications are divided into seven categories that describe the state of the art in each category. After a brief quantitative analysis of the literature, this survey deals with the hardware architecture of hybrid quantum-classical systems, as well as the software stack. We observe the development of a wide range of tools enabling hybrid systems and emphasize the need for future standardization of interfaces and methods to foster synergy.</description>

      <title>Enabling Security on the Edge: A CHERI Compartmentalized Network Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of embedded systems in critical infrastructures, interconnected edge devices like autonomous drones, and smart industrial systems requires robust security measures. Compromised systems increase the risks of operational failures, data breaches, and -- in safety-critical environments -- potential physical harm to people. Despite these risks, current security measures are often insufficient to fully address the attack surfaces of embedded devices. CHERI provides strong security from the hardware level by enabling fine-grained compartmentalization and memory protection, which can reduce the attack surface and improve the reliability of such devices. In this work, we explore the potential of CHERI to compartmentalize one of the most critical and targeted components of interconnected systems: their network stack. Our case study examines the trade-offs of isolating applications, TCP/IP libraries, and network drivers on a CheriBSD system deployed on the Arm Morello platform. Our results suggest that CHERI has the potential to enhance security while maintaining performance in embedded-like environments.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT is not A Man but Das Man: Representativeness and Structural Consistency of Silicon Samples Generated by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in the form of chatbots like ChatGPT and Llama are increasingly proposed as "silicon samples" for simulating human opinions. This study examines this notion, arguing that LLMs may misrepresent population-level opinions. We identify two fundamental challenges: a failure in structural consistency, where response accuracy doesn't hold across demographic aggregation levels, and homogenization, an underrepresentation of minority opinions. To investigate these, we prompted ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Meta's Llama 3.1 series (8B, 70B, 405B) with questions on abortion and unauthorized immigration from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. Our findings reveal significant structural inconsistencies and severe homogenization in LLM responses compared to human data. We propose an "accuracy-optimization hypothesis," suggesting homogenization stems from prioritizing modal responses. These issues challenge the validity of using LLMs, especially chatbots AI, as direct substitutes for human survey data, potentially reinforcing stereotypes and misinforming policy.</description>

      <title>Disclosing Generative AI Use in Digital Humanities Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey study investigates how digital humanists perceive and approach generative AI disclosure in research. The results indicate that while digital humanities scholars acknowledge the importance of disclosing GenAI use, the actual rate of disclosure in research practice remains low. Respondents differ in their views on which activities most require disclosure and on the most appropriate methods for doing so. Most also believe that safeguards for AI disclosure should be established through institutional policies rather than left to individual decisions. The study's findings will offer empirical guidance to scholars, institutional leaders, funders, and other stakeholders responsible for shaping effective disclosure policies.</description>

      <title>Graph Repairs with Large Language Models: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Property graphs are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and social networks, but they often contain errors due to inconsistencies, missing data, or schema violations. Traditional rule-based and heuristic-driven graph repair methods are limited in their adaptability as they need to be tailored for each dataset. On the other hand, interactive human-in-the-loop approaches may become infeasible when dealing with large graphs, as the cost--both in terms of time and effort--of involving users becomes too high. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for automated graph repair by leveraging contextual reasoning and their access to real-world knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of six open-source LLMs in repairing property graphs. We assess repair quality, computational cost, and model-specific performance. Our experiments show that LLMs have the potential to detect and correct errors, with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency. We discuss the strengths, limitations, and challenges of LLM-driven graph repair and outline future research directions for improving scalability and interpretability.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Game-Theory and Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Tourist Arrivals via Big Data Analytics and Opinion Leader Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations (pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China (post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT), ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Vector, Graph and Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipelines for Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding. Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study, we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness, answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance by 7%.</description>

      <title>Willchain: Decentralized, Privacy-Preserving, Self-Executing, Digital Wills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel decentralized protocol for digital estate planning that integrates advances distributed computing, and cryptography. The original proof-of-concept was constructed using purely solidity contracts. Since then, we have enhanced the implementation into a layer-1 protocol that uses modern interchain communication to connect several heterogeneous chain types. A key contribution of this research is the implementation of several modern cryptographic primitives to support various forms of claims for information validation. These primitives introduce an unmatched level of privacy to the process of digital inheritance. We also demonstrate on a set of heterogeneous smart contracts, following the same spec, on each chain to serve as entry points, gateways, or bridge contracts that are invoked via a path from the will module on our protocol, to the contract. This ensures a fair and secure distribution of digital assets in accordance with the wishes of the decedent without the requirement of moving their funds. This research further extends its innovations with a user interaction model, featuring a check-in system and account abstraction process, which enhances flexibility and user-friendliness without compromising on security. By developing a dedicated permissionless blockchain that is secured by a network of validators, and interchain relayers, the proposed protocol signifies a transformation in the digital estate planning industry and illustrates the potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing traditional legal and personal spheres. Implementing a cryptoeconomic network at the core of inheritance planning allows for unique incentive compatible economic mechanisms to be constructed.</description>

      <title>A Study of Gate-Based and Boson Sampling Quantum Random Number Generation on IBM and Xanadu Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics offers a fundamentally unpredictable entropy source due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum measurements, making it attractive for secure random number generation. This paper explores the practicality of generating random numbers from two quantum platforms: gate-based circuits on IBM Quantum and (Gaussian) boson sampling with Xanadu Borealis. We implement simple post-processing methods, including the classic Von Neumann extractor and two tailored variants designed to address the correlated structure of boson sampling outputs. We evaluate debiased output from real quantum hardware using the NIST SP800-22r1a test suite and measure the extraction efficiency of each debiasing method. Results show that, while unbiased bitstreams can be achieved on both platforms, throughput remains low and cost per random bit is high compared to specialized QRNG devices.</description>

      <title>MalVol-25: A Diverse, Labelled and Detailed Volatile Memory Dataset for Malware Detection and Response Testing and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality malware datasets that support advanced analysis techniques, particularly machine learning and agentic AI frameworks. Existing datasets often lack diversity, comprehensive labelling, and the complexity necessary for effective machine learning and agent-based AI training. To fill this gap, we developed a systematic approach for generating a dataset that combines automated malware execution in controlled virtual environments with dynamic monitoring tools. The resulting dataset comprises clean and infected memory snapshots across multiple malware families and operating systems, capturing detailed behavioural and environmental features. Key design decisions include applying ethical and legal compliance, thorough validation using both automated and manual methods, and comprehensive documentation to ensure replicability and integrity. The dataset's distinctive features enable modelling system states and transitions, facilitating RL-based malware detection and response strategies. This resource is significant for advancing adaptive cybersecurity defences and digital forensic research. Its scope supports diverse malware scenarios and offers potential for broader applications in incident response and automated threat mitigation.</description>

      <title>Driver-Net: Multi-Camera Fusion for Assessing Driver Take-Over Readiness in Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block, followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion. As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian Intention Prediction via Vision-Language Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames, physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to 19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual understanding for autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>Ethics by Design: A Lifecycle Framework for Trustworthy AI in Medical Imaging From Transparent Data Governance to Clinically Validated Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging raises crucial ethical concerns at every stage of its development, from data collection to deployment. Addressing these concerns is essential for ensuring that AI systems are developed and implemented in a manner that respects patient rights and promotes fairness. This study aims to explore the ethical implications of AI in medical imaging, focusing on five key stages: data collection, data processing, model training, model evaluation, and deployment. The goal is to evaluate how these stages adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including data privacy, fairness, transparency, accountability, and autonomy. An analytical approach was employed to examine the ethical challenges associated with each stage of AI development. We reviewed existing literature, guidelines, and regulations concerning AI ethics in healthcare and identified critical ethical issues at each stage. The study outlines specific inquiries and principles for each phase of AI development. The findings highlight key ethical issues: ensuring patient consent and anonymization during data collection, addressing biases in model training, ensuring transparency and fairness during model evaluation, and the importance of continuous ethical assessments during deployment. The analysis also emphasizes the impact of accessibility issues on different stakeholders, including private, public, and third-party entities. The study concludes that ethical considerations must be systematically integrated into each stage of AI development in medical imaging. By adhering to these ethical principles, AI systems can be made more robust, transparent, and aligned with patient care and data control. We propose tailored ethical inquiries and strategies to support the creation of ethically sound AI systems in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Node Replacement based Approximate Quantum Simulation with Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating a quantum circuit with a classical computer requires exponentially growing resources. Decision diagrams exploit the redundancies in quantum circuit representation to efficiently represent and simulate quantum circuits. But for complicated quantum circuits like the quantum supremacy benchmark, there is almost no redundancy to exploit. Therefore, it often makes sense to do a trade-off between simulation accuracy and memory requirement. Previous work on approximate simulation with decision diagrams exploits this trade-off by removing less important nodes. In this work, instead of removing these nodes, we try to find similar nodes to replace them, effectively slowing down the fidelity loss when reducing the memory. In addition, we adopt Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to drastically reduce the computational complexity for searching for replacement nodes. Our new approach achieves a better memory-accuracy trade-off for representing a quantum circuit with decision diagrams with minimal run time overhead. Notably, our approach shows good scaling properties when increasing the circuit size and depth. For the first time, a strong better-than-linear trade-off between memory and fidelity is demonstrated for a decision diagram based quantum simulation when representing the quantum supremacy benchmark circuits at high circuit depths, showing the potential of drastically reducing the resource requirement for approximate simulation of the quantum supremacy benchmarks on a classical computer.</description>

      <title>Optimized Bistable Vortex Memory Arrays for Superconducting In-Memory Matrix-Vector Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon previously introduced Bistable Vortex Memory (BVM) as a novel, nonvolatile, high-density, and scalable superconductor memory technology, this work presents a methodology that uses BVM arrays to address challenges in data-driven algorithms and neural networks, specifically focusing on matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). The BVM approach introduces a novel superconductor-based methodology for in-memory arithmetic, achieving ultra-high-speed and energy-efficient computation by utilizing BVM arrays for in-memory computation. The design employs a tiled multiplier structure where BVM's inherent current summation capability is combined with Quantizer Buffer (QB) cells to convert the analog accumulated current into a variable number of digital Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) pulses. These pulses are then processed by T1 adder cells, which handle binary addition and carry propagation, thereby forming a complete functional multiplier unit. This paper thus presents an efficient MVM architecture that uses these BVM-based multipliers in a systolic array configuration to enable parallel computation. A key innovation is an optimized BVM array structure specifically tailored for multiplication applications, involving a restructuring of Sense Lines (SLs) with diagonal connections to reduce area and an adjusted input scheme to enhance computational efficiency compared to the general-purpose BVM array design. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a 4-bit multiplier operating at 20 GHz with 50 ps latency and an MVM structure demonstrating operation at 20 GHz. Furthermore, we showcase how this multiplier design can be extended to support Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. This work paves the way for power-efficient neural networks by enabling high-speed in-memory computation.</description>

      <title>DYNAMO: Dynamic Neutral Atom Multi-programming Optimizer Towards Quantum Operating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances towards practical applications, quantum operating systems become inevitable, where multi-programming -- the core functionality of operating systems -- enables concurrent execution of multiple quantum programs to enhance hardware utilization. However, most quantum compilation work focuses solely on single-circuit execution, severely limiting resource efficiency and hindering quantum operating system development. We propose Dynamic Neutral Atom Multi-programming Optimizer (DYNAMO), a method that realizes multi-programming on neutral atom quantum architectures through parallel compilation and intelligent resource allocation across multiple quantum processing units (QPUs). DYNAMO addresses two critical challenges: inefficient and difficult resource partitioning, and complex scheduling conflicts from concurrent program. Our method enables efficient spatial and temporal resource sharing while maintaining circuit correctness and hardware constraints. Experimental evaluation across circuits ranging from 12 to over 1200 gates demonstrates that DYNAMO achieves up to 14.39x compilation speedup while reducing execution stages by an average of 50.47%. Furthermore, DYNAMO successfully distributes workloads across multiple QPUs with balanced resource utilization. By enabling efficient multi-programming capabilities, DYNAMO establishes a critical foundation towards realizing practical quantum operating systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the utilization of Quantum Computing and Neuromorphic Computing for Safe, Reliable, and Explainable Multi_Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in the context of optimal control in autonomous robotics. The objective was to address the challenges of optimizing the behavior of autonomous agents while ensuring safety, reliability, and explainability. Quantum Computing techniques, including Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), were employed to efficiently explore large solution spaces and find approximate solutions to complex MARL problems. Neuromorphic Computing, inspired by the architecture of the human brain, provided parallel and distributed processing capabilities, which were leveraged to develop intelligent and adaptive systems. The combination of these technologies held the potential to enhance the safety, reliability, and explainability of MARL in autonomous robotics. This research contributed to the advancement of autonomous robotics by exploring cutting-edge technologies and their applications in multi-agent systems. Codes and data are available.</description>

      <title>AR Glulam: Accurate Augmented Reality Using Multiple Fiducial Markers for Glulam Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Augmented Reality (AR) have demonstrated applications in architecture, design, and fabrication. Compared to conventional 2D construction drawings, AR can be used to superimpose contextual instructions, display 3D spatial information and enable on-site engagement. Despite the potential of AR, the widespread adoption of the technology in the industry is limited by its precision. Precision is important for projects requiring strict construction tolerances, design fidelity, and fabrication feedback. For example, the manufacturing of glulam beams requires tolerances of less than 2mm. The goal of this project is to explore the industrial application of using multiple fiducial markers for high-precision AR fabrication. While the method has been validated in lab settings with a precision of 0.97, this paper focuses on fabricating glulam beams in a factory setting with an industry manufacturer, Unalam Factory.</description>

      <title>Augmenting software engineering with AI and developing it further towards AI-assisted model-driven software engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of model-driven software engineering (MDSE) has been successfully demonstrated in the context of complex software; however, it has not been widely adopted due to the requisite efforts associated with model development and maintenance, as well as the specific modelling competencies required for MDSE. Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, particularly deep learning methods, have demonstrated considerable abilities when applied to the huge code bases accessible on open-source coding platforms. The so-called big code provides the basis for significant advances in empirical software engineering, as well as in the automation of coding processes and improvements in software quality with the use of AI. The objective of this paper is to facilitate a synthesis between these two significant domains of software engineering (SE), namely models and AI in SE. The paper provides an overview of the current state of AI-augmented software engineering and develops a corresponding taxonomy, ai4se. In light of the aforementioned considerations, a vision of AI-assisted big models in SE is put forth, with the aim of capitalising on the advantages inherent to both approaches in the context of software development. Finally, the pair modelling paradigm is proposed for adoption by the MDSE industry.</description>

      <title>Gesture Recognition for Feedback Based Mixed Reality and Robotic Fabrication: A Case Study of the UnLog Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) platforms enable users to interact with three-dimensional holographic instructions during the assembly and fabrication of highly custom and parametric architectural constructions without the necessity of two-dimensional drawings. Previous MR fabrication projects have primarily relied on digital menus and custom buttons as the interface for user interaction with the MR environment. Despite this approach being widely adopted, it is limited in its ability to allow for direct human interaction with physical objects to modify fabrication instructions within the MR environment. This research integrates user interactions with physical objects through real-time gesture recognition as input to modify, update or generate new digital information enabling reciprocal stimuli between the physical and the virtual environment. Consequently, the digital environment is generative of the user's provided interaction with physical objects to allow seamless feedback in the fabrication process. This research investigates gesture recognition for feedback-based MR workflows for robotic fabrication, human assembly, and quality control in the construction of the UnLog Tower.</description>
