      <title>Rank 1 phenomena for 1-relator and deficiency 1 groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine second bounded cohomology and mod p homology in finite index subgroups of 1-relator groups and groups with a presentation of deficiency at least one. We use this to determine exactly which 1-relator groups are boundedly generated, as well as the groups of deficiency at least one up to a class of groups that conjecturally do not exist.</description>

      <title>On the Codegree graphs of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The codegree of an irreducible character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$ is defined as $|G:\ker\chi|/\chi(1)$. The codegree graph $\Gamma(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the prime divisors of $|G|$, where two distinct primes $p$ and $q$ are adjacent if and only if $pq$ divides the codegree of some irreducible character of $G$. In this paper, we prove that a graph can occur as a codegree graph $\Gamma(G)$ of some finite group $G$ if and only if its complement is triangle-free and $3$-colorable. This generalizes the known characterization for codegree graphs from solvable groups to all finite groups. As an application, we give a full classification of all groups for which $\Gamma(G)$ is a $5$-cycle. We also investigate conditions under which the codegree graph coincides with or differs from the prime graph for solvable groups.</description>

      <title>Higher power polyadic group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically develops the theory of polyadic group rings, a higher arity generalization of classical group rings $\mathcal{R}[\mathsf{G}]$. We construct the fundamental operations of these structures, defining the $\mathbf{m}_{r}$-ary addition and $\mathbf{n}_{r} $-ary multiplication for a polyadic group ring $\mathrm{R}^{[\mathbf{m} _{r},\mathbf{n}_{r}]}=\mathcal{R}^{[m_{r},n_{r}]}[\mathsf{G}^{[n_{g}]}]$ built from an $(m_{r},n_{r})$-ring and an $n_{g}$-ary group. A central result is the derivation of the "quantization" conditions that interrelate these arities, governed by the arity freedom principle, which also extends to operations with higher polyadic powers. We establish key algebraic properties, including conditions for total associativity and the existence of a zero element and identity. The concepts of the polyadic augmentation map and augmentation ideal are generalized, providing a bridge to the classical theory. The framework is illustrated with explicit examples, solidifying the theoretical constructions. This work establishes a new foundation in ring theory with potential applications in cryptography and coding theory, as evidenced by recent schemes utilizing polyadic structures.</description>

      <title>Partitioning $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$ in finite fields and groups of trees and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the algebraic and graphical structure of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$, with a focus on its decomposition into finite fields, kernels, and special subsets. We establish classical isomorphisms between $\mathbb{F}_s$ and $p\mathbb{F}_s$, as well as $p\mathbb{F}_s^{\star}$ and $p\mathbb{F}_s^{+1,\star}$. We introduce the notion of arcs and rooted trees to describe the pre-periodic structure of $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$, and prove that trees rooted at elements not divisible by $s$ or $p$ can be generated from the tree of unity via multiplication by cyclic arcs. Furthermore, we define and analyze the set $\mathbb{D}_{sp}$, consisting of elements that are neither multiples of $s$ or $p$ nor "off-by-one" elements, and show that its graph decomposes into cycles and pre-periodic trees. Finally, we demonstrate that every cycle in $\mathbb{Z}_{sp}$ contains inner cycles that are derived predictably from the cycles of the finite fields $p\mathbb{F}_s$ and $s\mathbb{F}_p$, and we discuss the cryptographic relevance of $\mathbb{D}_{sp}$, highlighting its potential for analyzing cyclic attacks and factorization methods.</description>

      <title>Short hierarchically hyperbolic groups I: uncountably many coarse median structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09232v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the mapping class group of a sphere with five punctures admits uncountably many coarsely equivariant coarse median structures. The same is shown for right-angled Artin groups whose defining graphs are connected, triangle- and square-free, and have at least three vertices. Remarkably, in the latter case, the coarse median structures we produce are not induced by cocompact cubulations. To obtain the above results, we develop the theory of short hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHG), which also include Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type, graph manifold groups, and extensions of Veech groups. We develop tools to modify their hierarchical structure, including using quasimorphisms to construct quasilines that serve as coordinate spaces, and this is where the abundance of coarse median structures comes from. These techniques are of independent interest, and are used in a follow-up paper with Alessandro Sisto to study quotients of short HHG. In the process, we also clarify a proof of Hagen, Martin, and Sisto on hierarchical hyperbolicity of Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type.</description>

      <title>Lifting Generators in Connected Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an epimorphism between topological groups $f:G\to H$, when can a generating set of $H$ be lifted to a generating set of $G$?
  We show that for connected Lie groups the problem is fundamentally abelian: generators can be lifted if and only if they can be lifted in the induced map between the abelianisations (assuming the number of generators is at least the minimal number of generators of $G$). As a consequence, we deduce that connected perfect Lie groups satisfy the Gasch\"utz lemma: generating sets of quotients can always be lifted. If the Lie group is not perfect, this may fail. The extent to which a group fails to satisfy the Gasch\"utz lemma is measured by its \emph{Gasch\"utz rank}, which we bound for all connected Lie groups, and compute exactly in most cases. Additionally, we compute the maximal size of an irredundant generating set of connected abelian Lie groups, and discuss connections between such generation problems with the Wiegold conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometric rigidity for lamplighters with lamps of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quasi-isometry between two connected graphs is measure-scaling if one can control precisely the sizes of pre-images of finite subsets. Such a notion is motivated by the work of Eskin-Fisher-Whyte on lamplighters over $\mathbb{Z}$ and the work of Dymarz on biLipschitz equivalences of amenable groups, and led Genevois and Tessera to introduce the scaling group $\text{Sc}(X)$ of an amenable bounded degree graph $X$. The main result of our article is a rigidity property for quasi-isometries between lamplighters with lamps of polynomial growth. Under assumptions on $G$ and $H$, any such quasi-isometry $N\wr G\longrightarrow M\wr H$ must be measure-scaling for some scaling factor depending on the growth degrees of $N$ and $M$. In particular, the scaling group of such wreath products is reduced to $\lbrace 1\rbrace$. As applications, we obtain additional examples of pairs of quasi-isometric groups that are not biLipschitz equivalent. We also give applications to the quasi-isometric classification of some iterated wreath products, and we exhibit the first example of an amenable finitely generated group $H$ which is lamplighter-rigid, in the sense that $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\wr H$ and $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}\wr H$ are quasi-isometric if and only if $n=m$.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy invariants and rigidity in Garside groups: a uniformity phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an element~$x$ of a Garside group which is rigid in the sense of Garside-theory. Let $SC(x)$ be the set of rigid conjugates of~$x$ -- this is a well-known characteristic subset of the conjugacy class of~$x$. We present computational evidence that the sequence $( |SC(x^n)| )_{n\in\mathbb N}$ is not only bounded, but in fact periodic, and that there is a bound on the length of the period which depends only on the underlying group and its Garside structure. We prove this result in the special case of the circular Garside groups, including the 2-generator Artin groups with their classical and dual structures (where we prove that the sequence is always constant), and in the case of the dual $4$-strand braid group.</description>

      <title>Constructing Highly Symmetric Compact Manifolds and Algebraic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every algebraically closed field $k$ and natural number $r$, we construct several algebraic varieties (over $k$) whose birational automorphism group contains every finite nilpotent group of class at most $2$, rank at most $r$ whose order is coprime to the characteristic of $k$. This construction is sharp in characteristic $0$, i.e. up to bounded extension, the set of groups from the statement cannot be replaced by a larger one. Using similar main ideas (with different technical details), for every $r$, we construct several compact manifolds whose diffeomorphism groups contain every finite nilpotent group of class at most $2$, rank at most $r$. This result answers a question of Mundet~i~Riera affirmatively and is conjecturally sharp up to bounded extension.</description>

      <title>Spaces of subgroups of toral groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the space of conjugacy classes of subgroups of a compact Lie group G whose identity component is a torus, and consider how various invariants of subgroups behave as sheaves over this space. This feeds in to the author's programme to give algebraic models of rational G-equivariant cohomology theories.
  The methods are illustrated by making the outcome explicit for all toral subgroups of compact connected rank 2 groups.</description>
