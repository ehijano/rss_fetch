      <title>The High-Resolution Far- to Near-Infrared Anharmonic Absorption Spectra of Cyano-Substituted Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from 300-6200 cm$^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyano-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CN-PAHs) may contribute to the emission detected in the 7 - 9 $\mu$m (1430 - 1100 cm$^{-1}$) and 11 - 15 $\mu$m (900 - 670 cm$^{-1}$) regions of astronomical IR spectra. Anharmonic quantum chemical computations of 17 CN-PAH isomers for 4 small PAHs and Benzene reveal strong, broad absorption features across the entire 300 - 6200 cm$^{-1}$ (33 - 1.6 $\mu$m) frequency range. In particular, when a FWHM of 15 cm$^{-1}$ is applied, the composite CN-PAH spectrum is almost indistinguishable from the unsubstituted-PAH spectrum. At high resolution, however, the infrared absorption spectra reveal unique, identifiable features of CN-PAHs in the 700 - 950, 1100 - 1300, 2000 - 2500, and 3400 - 3600 cm$^{-1}$ ranges. The in-plane and out-of-plane CH bending vibrational frequencies of CN-PAHs are shifted when comparing isomers and to their unsubstituted counterparts, making their differentiation in mixed laboratory experiments possible. The overall aromatic CH stretch fundamental (2950 - 3200 cm$^{-1}$) and first overtone (5950 - 6200 cm$^{-1}$) regions are relatively unaffected by the cyano-substitution, with changes only to the breadth and intensity of the bands. Detailed spectroscopic data on the normal mode components of each state reported herein provide the means to directly assign future laboratory spectra and to guide direct IR observations of astronomical regions with, e.g., JWST.</description>

      <title>Hedgehog: An Isolated Quiescent Dwarf Galaxy at 2.4 Mpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that almost all isolated dwarf galaxies are actively forming stars. We report the discovery of Hedgehog, an isolated quiescent dwarf galaxy at a distance of $2.41\pm0.14$ Mpc with a stellar mass of $M_\star \approx 10^{5.8}\, M_\odot$. The distance is measured using surface brightness fluctuations with both Legacy Surveys and deep Magellan/IMACS imaging data. Hedgehog is 1.7 Mpc from the nearest galaxy group, Centaurus A, and has no neighboring galaxies within 1 Mpc, making it one of the most isolated quiescent dwarfs at this stellar mass. It has a red optical color, early-type morphology, and shows no UV emission. This indicates that Hedgehog has an old stellar population and is quiescent in star formation. Compared with other quiescent dwarfs in the Local Group and Local Volume, Hedgehog appears smaller in size for its luminosity but is consistent with the mass--size relations. Hedgehog might be a backsplash galaxy from the Centaurus A group, but it could also have been quenched in the field by ram pressure stripping in the cosmic web, reionization, or internal processes such as supernova and stellar feedback. Future observations are needed to fully unveil its formation, history, and quenching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Deep HST imaging favors the bulgeless edge-on galaxy explanation for the hypothetical stellar wake created by a runaway supermassive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long linear structure recently discovered could be the stellar wake produced by the passage of a runaway supermassive black hole (SMBH) or, alternatively, a bulgeless edge-on galaxy. We report on new very deep HST imaging that seems to be in tension with the SMBH runaway scenario but is consistent with the bulgeless edge-on galaxy scenario. The new observations were aimed at detecting two key features expected in the SMBH scenario, namely, the bow shock formed where the SMBH meets the surrounding medium, and a counter stellar wake created by another binary SMBH hypothesized as part of the ejection mechanism. Neither of these two features appears to be present in the new images, as would be expected in the edge-on galaxy scenario.</description>

      <title>Ionizing photons produced by massive stars in SMC-N88a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The H II region N88a in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a spherical region of $1.5~\mathrm{pc}$ diameter, with high concentration of gas and dust, and at least four massive stars within it. Previous studies suggest that the four known sources may be insufficient to ionize the region and explain the nebular emission. In this contribution we analyze the ionizing photon production of the four known sources within the H II region. We compared the available photometry in the literature with the spectral energy distribution calculated for the ``Potsdam Wolf-Rayet'' (PoWR) models of massive stars for a wide range of dust extinction coefficient (Av). In particular, we selected models of OB-type atmospheres with SMC metallicity and compared the ionizing photon flux prediction with previous estimates based on the nebular emission of the H {\sc ii} region. We found that the Av values that best reproduce the photometry of each source vary from 0.82 to 3.84, increasing toward the dust band that runs through the nebula. In addition, all four sources are compatible with O-type stars with $\mathrm{T_{eff}} &gt; 40 ~\mathrm{kK}$ and intrinsic ratios $\mathrm{F(LyC)/F(UV)}&gt;1$. Lastly, the total ionizing photon rate predicted by the hottest models is $\mathrm{log(Q_H)} &gt; 49.6 ~\mathrm{ph\ s}^{-1}$, which suggests that the stars could maintain the ionization state of the nebula.</description>

      <title>Nexus: A framework for simulations of idealised galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for realistic, dynamically self-consistent, evolving galaxy models that avoid the inherent complexity of full, and zoom-in, cosmological simulations, we have developed Nexus, an integral, flexible framework to create synthetic galaxies made of both collisionless and gaseous components. Nexus leverages the power of publicly available, tried-and-tested packages: i) the stellar-dynamics, action-based library AGAMA; and ii) the Adaptive Mesh Refinement, N-body/hydrodynamical code Ramses, modified to meet our needs. In addition, we make use of a proprietary module to account for realistic galaxy formation (sub-grid) physics, including star formation, stellar feedback, and chemical enrichment. As a framework to perform controlled experiments of idealised galaxies, Nexus' basic functionality consists in the generation of bespoke initial conditions (ICs) for any desired galaxy model, which are advanced in time to simulate the system's evolution. The fully self-consistent ICs are generated with a distribution-function based approach, as implemented in the galaxy modelling module of AGAMA -- up to now restricted to collisionless components, extended in this work to treat two types of gaseous configurations: (i) hot halos; and (ii) gas disks. For the first time, we are able to construct equilibrium models with disc gas fractions in the range $0 &lt; f_{\rm gas} &lt; 1$, needed to model high-redshift galaxies. The framework is ideally suited to the study of galactic ecology, specifically how stars and gas work together over billions of years. As a validation of our framework, we reproduce - and improve upon - several isolated galaxy model setups reported in earlier studies. Finally, we showcase Nexus by presenting an interesting type of `nested bar' galaxy class. Future upgrades of Nexus will include magneto-hydrodynamics and highly energetic particle (`cosmic ray') heating.</description>

      <title>Observation of complex organic molecules containing peptide-like bonds towards hot core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the star formation regions, the complex organic molecules that contain peptide bonds ($-$NH$-$C(=O)$-$) play a major role in the metabolic process because $-$NH$-$C(=O)$-$ is connected to amino acids (R-CHNH$_{2}$$-$COOH). Over the past few decades, many complex organic molecules containing peptide-like bonds have been detected in hot molecular cores, hot corinos, and cold molecular clouds, however, their prebiotic chemistry is poorly understood. We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO) and isocyanic acid (HNCO), which contain peptide-like bonds towards the chemically rich hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, using high-resolution and high-sensitivity Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) bands 6 and 7. We estimate that the column densities of NH$_{2}$CHO and HNCO towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 are (2.80$\pm$0.29)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (1.80$\pm$0.42)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with excitation temperatures of 165$\pm$21 K and 170$\pm$32 K, respectively. The fractional abundances of NH$_{2}$CHO and HNCO towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 are (9.03$\pm$1.44)$\times$10$^{-10}$ and (5.80$\pm$2.09)$\times$10$^{-9}$. We compare the estimated abundances of NH$_{2}$CHO and HNCO with the existing three-phase warm-up chemical model abundance values and notice that the observed and modelled abundances are very close. We conclude that NH$_{2}$CHO is produced by the reaction of NH$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$CO in the gas phase towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1. Likewise, HNCO is produced on the surface of grains by the reaction of NH and CO towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1. We also found that NH$_{2}$CHO and HNCO are chemically linked towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.</description>

      <title>Is the Young Star Association $\epsilon$Cha Double?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinematics of the $\epsilon$ Cha young stellar association close to the Sun has been studied based on a list of candidate stars from the Dickson-Vandervelde work. The working sample consists of 26 stars with parallaxes, proper motions from the Gaia~DR3 catalog and radial velocities taken from literary sources. The orbits of the stars back to the past were constructed, and the moment when the association had a minimum spatial size was determined, as well as an analysis of the dependencies of the velocities $U,V,W$ on the coordinates $x,y,z$ was carried out. It is shown that the initial sample is divided into two parts with different kinematic properties. The first sample included 9 stars. Based on the construction of the orbits of these 9 stars, an age estimate of $t=4.9\pm0.8$ million years was obtained. An expansion coefficient in the $xz$ plane with the value $K_{xz}=135\pm19$ km/s/kpc was also found for them, on the basis of which another age estimate $t=7.2\pm1.0$ million years was obtained. The second sample included 17 stars. The construction of their orbits gave an estimate of age $t=0.2\pm0.3$ million years, and based on the gradient $\partial W/\partial z=707\pm248$ km/s/kpc, a second estimate of their age $t=1.4\pm0.5$ million years was obtained. This suggests that the $\epsilon$ Cha association either consists of two groupings of different ages, or a younger one arose as a result of a recent outbreak of star formation within a common star system. The question of the gravitational connection of the groupings has not been considered in the framework of this work.</description>

      <title>The Complex Star Formation History of the Halo of NGC 5128 (Cen A)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 5128 (Cen A) is the nearest giant elliptical galaxy and one of the brightest extragalactic radio sources in the sky, boasting a prominent dust lane and jets emanating from its nuclear supermassive black hole. In this paper, we construct the star formation history (SFH) of two small fields in the halo of NGC 5128: a northeastern field (Field 1) at a projected distance of $\sim 18.8$ kpc from the center, and a southern field (Field 2) $\sim 9.9$ kpc from the center. Our method is based on identifying long period variable (LPV) stars that trace their sibling stellar population and hence historical star formation due to their high luminosity and strong variability; we identified 395 LPVs in Field 1 and 671 LPVs in Field 2. Even though the two fields are $\sim 28$ kpc apart on opposite sides from the center, they show similar SFHs. In Field 1, star formation rates (SFRs) increased significantly around $t\sim 800$ Myr and $t\sim 3.8$ Gyr; and in Field 2, SFRs increased considerably around $t\sim 800$ Myr, $t\sim 3.8$ Gyr, and $t\sim 6.3$ Gyr, where $t$ is look--back time. The increase in SFR $\sim 800$ Myr ago agrees with previous suggestions that the galaxy experienced a merger around that time. The SFH reconstructed from LPVs supports a scenario in which multiple episodes of nuclear activity lead to episodic jet-induced star formation. While there is no catalog of LPVs for the central part of NGC 5128, applying our method to the outer regions (for the first time in a galaxy outside the Local Group) has enabled us to put constraints on the complex evolution of this cornerstone galaxy.</description>

      <title>BreakBRD Galaxies III: Evolutionary Clues Through an Analysis of Gas Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining newly obtained deep GBT 21cm observations with optical spectroscopic data, we present an analysis of the gas content of BreakBRD galaxies, a population denoted by their blue star-forming centers and red quenched disks that do not appear to follow the typical inside-out evolution of spiral galaxies. We confirm previous results that the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas fractions of BreakBRDs are on-average lower than those of typical galaxies on the star-forming sequence (SFS), and find that their \ion{H}{1} fractions are generally higher than Green Valley (GV) galaxies. HI depletion times for BreakBRDs are roughly an order of magnitude lower than those of SFS galaxies, in stark contrast with GV galaxies that typically have much longer depletion times than SFS galaxies. The nuclear gas-phase metallicities of BreakBRDs have a broader distribution than SFS galaxies and are skewed towards slightly above-average values. BreakBRDs are systematically offset from the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation towards lower baryonic mass at a given rotation velocity. They also have higher typical HI asymmetries than SFS galaxies, and of those galaxies with spatially resolved gas velocity fields from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, two-thirds are either highly distorted or completely misaligned relative to the stellar disk. Evidence supports a scenario where BreakBRDs are in an early phase of quenching, and there is mixed evidence that their behavior is related to past merger activity.</description>

      <title>Volume density maps of the 862nm DIB carrier and interstellar dust: a hint for the role of carbon-rich ejecta from AGB stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The carbonaceous macromolecules imprinting in astronomical spectra the numerous absorptions called Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) are omnipresent in the Galaxy and beyond and represent a considerable reservoir of organic matter. However, their chemical formulae, formation and destruction sites remain open questions. Their spatial distribution and the local relation to other interstellar species is paramount to unravel their role in the lifecycle of organic matter. Volume density maps bring local instead of line-of-sight distributed information, and allow for new diagnostics. We present the first large-scale volume (3D) density map of a DIB carrier and compare it with an equivalent map of interstellar dust. The DIB carrier map is obtained through hierarchical inversion of about 202,000 measurements of the 8621 nm DIB obtained with the Gaia-RVS instrument. It covers about 4000 pc around the Sun in the Galactic plane. A dedicated interstellar dust map is built based on extinction towards the same target stars. At the 50 pc resolution of the maps, the 3D DIB distribution is found remarkably similar in shape to the 3D distribution of dust. On the other hand, the DIB-to-dust local density ratio increases in low-dust areas. It is also increasing away from the disk, however, the minimum ratio is found to be shifted above the Plane to Z = +50pc. Finally, the average ratio is also surprisingly found to increase away from the Galactic Center. We suggest that the three latter trends may be indications of a dominant contribution of material from the carbon-rich category of dying giant stars to the formation of the carriers. Our suggestion is based on recent catalogues of AGB stars and estimates of their mass fluxes of C-rich and O-rich ejecta.</description>

      <title>Description of turbulent dynamics in the interstellar medium: Multifractal microcanonical analysis: II. Sparse filtering of Herschel observation maps and visualization of filamentary structures at different length scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present significant improvements to our previous work on noise reduction in {\sl Herschel} observation maps by defining sparse filtering tools capable of handling, in a unified formalism, a significantly improved noise reduction as well as a deconvolution in order to reduce effects introduced by the limited instrumental response (beam). We implement greater flexibility by allowing a wider choice of parsimonious priors in the noise-reduction process. More precisely, we introduce a sparse filtering and deconvolution approach approach of type $l^2$-$l^p$, with $p &gt; 0$ variable and apply it to a larger set of molecular clouds using {\sl Herschel} 250 $\mu $m data in order to demonstrate their wide range of application. In the {\sl Herschel} data, we are able to use this approach to highlight extremely fine filamentary structures and obtain singularity spectra that tend to show a significantly less $\log$-normal behavior and a filamentary nature in the less dense regions. We also use high-resolution adaptive magneto-hydrodynamic simulation data to assess the quality of deconvolution in such a simulated beaming framework.</description>

      <title>A high-velocity star recently ejected by an intermediate-mass black hole in M15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is crucial for understanding various astrophysical phenomena, yet their existence remains elusive, except for the LIGO-Virgo detection. We report the discovery of a high-velocity star J0731+3717, whose backward trajectory about 21 Myr ago intersects that of globular cluster M15 within the cluster tidal radius. Both its metallicity [Fe/H] and its alpha-to-iron abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe] are consistent with those of M15. Furthermore, its location falls right on the fiducial sequence of the cluster M15 on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, suggesting similar ages. These support that J0731+3717 is originally associated with M15 at a confidence level of $5.4\sigma$. We find that such a high-velocity star ($V_{\rm ej} = 548^{+6}_{-5}$ km s$^{-1}$) was most likely tidally ejected from as close as one astronomical unit to the center of M15, confirming an IMBH ($\ge 100 M_{\odot}$ with a credibility of 98%) as the exclusive nature of the central unseen mass proposed previously.</description>

Abstract: A powerful tool to probe the gas content at high redshift is the [C II] 158 $\mu$m sub-millimeter emission line, which, due to its low excitation potential and luminous emission, is considered a possible direct tracer of star forming gas. In this work we investigate the origin, evolution and environmental dependencies of [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission line, as well as its expected correlation with stellar mass and star formation activity of the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST. We use a set of state-of-the-art cold-gas hydrodynamic simulations (ColdSIM) with fully coupled time-dependent atomic and molecular non-equilibrium chemistry and self-consistent [C II] emission from metal enriched gas. We accurately track the evolution of H I, H II and $H_2$ in a cosmological context and predict both global and galaxy-based [C II] properties. For the first time, we predict the cosmic mass density evolution of [C II] and find that it is in good agreement with new measurements at redshift z = 6 from high-resolution optical quasar spectroscopy. We find a correlation between [C II] luminosity, $L_{[C II]}$, and stellar mass, consistent with results from ALMA high-redshift large programs. We predict a redshift evolution in the relation between $L_{[C II]}$ and the star formation rate, SFR, and provide a fit to relate $L_{[C II]}$ to SFR which can be adopted as a more accurate alternative to the currently used linear relation. Our findings provide physical grounds to interpret high-redshift detections in contemporary and future observations, such as the ones performed by ALMA and JWST, and to advance our knowledge on structure formation at early times.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of globular clusters in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy IKN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moderate resolution spectra of four globular clusters in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy IKN obtained with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory have been used to determine the radial velocities, ages, and metallicities of the clusters, and also to derive the first approximate estimates of the abundances of Mg, Ca, and C. Cross-correlation with radial-velocity standards, fitting of the observed spectra with model spectra, diagnostic diagrams based on the Lick absorption indices, and comparison of the spectra and absorption indices with those of Galactic globular clusters are applied. The integrated-light (IL) spectrum of the two bright clusters IKN4 and IKN5, which are close to the center of the galaxy in projection on the celestial sphere, yields the heliocentric radial velocity $V_h= 38\pm30$ km/s, age $T=12.6\pm2$ Gyr, metallicity $[Fe/H]=-2.1\pm0.2$ dex and abundance of $\alpha$-process elements $[\alpha/Fe] \sim 0.5$ dex. The IL spectrum of the two weaker clusters IKN1 and IKN3, which are far from the center of the galaxy, yields the radial velocity $V_h=-39 \pm 50$ km/s. Despite of the low signal to noise ratio in the summary spectrum of IKN1 and IKN3, one can conclude from the comparison of the results of different used methods, that IKN1 and IKN3 have seemingly the same age and metallicity as IKN4 and IKN5. According to the measured Lick indices H$_{\delta_{\rm F}}$ and H$_{\beta}$, the studied globular clusters in IKN have blue horizontal branches.</description>

      <title>WISDOM project XX -- Strong shear tearing molecular clouds apart in NGC 524</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are known to harbour dense spheroids of stars but scarce star formation (SF). Approximately a quarter of these galaxies have rich molecular gas reservoirs yet do not form stars efficiently. We study here the ETG NGC~524, with strong shear suspected to result in a smooth molecular gas disc and low star-formation efficiency (SFE). We present new spatially-resolved observations of the \textsuperscript{12}CO(2-1)-emitting cold molecular gas from the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) and of the warm ionised-gas emission lines from SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Although constrained by the resolution of the ALMA observations ($\approx37$~pc), we identify only $52$ GMCs with radii ranging from $30$ to $140$~pc, a low mean molecular gas mass surface density $\langle\Sigma_{\rm gas}\rangle\approx125$~M$_\odot$~pc$^{-2}$ and a high mean virial parameter $\langle\alpha_{\rm obs,vir}\rangle\approx5.3$. We measure spatially-resolved molecular gas depletion times ($\tau_{\rm dep}\equiv1/{\rm SFE}$) with a spatial resolution of $\approx100$~pc within a galactocentric distance of $1.5$~kpc. The global depletion time is $\approx2.0$~Gyr but $\tau_{\rm dep}$ increases toward the galaxy centre, with a maximum $\tau_{\rm dep,max}\approx5.2$~Gyr. However, no pure \ion{H}{II} region is identified in NGC~524 using ionised-gas emission-line ratio diagnostics, so the $\tau_{\rm dep}$ inferred are in fact lower limits. Measuring the GMC properties and dynamical states, we conclude that shear is the dominant mechanism shaping the molecular gas properties and regulating SF in NGC~524. This is supported by analogous analyses of the GMCs in a simulated ETG similar to NGC~524.</description>

      <title>High-redshift quasars at $z \geq 3$: radio variability and MPS/GPS candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the radio variability of bright, $S_{1.4}\geq100$ mJy, high-redshift quasars at $z\geq3$ on timescales up to 30-40 years. The study involved simultaneous RATAN-600 measurements at frequencies of 2.3, 4.7, 8.2, 11.2, and 22.3 GHz in 2017-2020. In addition, data from the literature were used. We have found that the variability index, $V_S$, which quantifies the normalized difference between the maximum and minimum flux density while accounting for measurement uncertainties, ranges from 0.02 to 0.96 for the quasars. Approximately half of the objects in the sample exhibit a variability index within the range of 0.25 to 0.50, comparable to that observed in blazars at lower redshifts. The distribution of $V_S$ at 22.3 GHz is significantly different from that at 2.3-11.2 GHz, which may be attributed to the fact that a compact AGN core dominates at the source's rest frame frequencies greater than 45 GHz, leading to higher variability indices obtained at 22.3 GHz (the $V_S$ distribution peaks around 0.4) compared to the lower frequencies (the $V_S$ distribution at 2.3 and 4.7 GHz peaks around 0.1-0.2). Several source groups with distinctive variability characteristics were found using cluster analysis of quasars. We propose 7 new candidates for gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) sources and 5 new megahertz peaked-spectrum (MPS) sources based on their spectrum shape and variability features. Only 6 out of 23 sources previously reported as GPS demonstrate a low variability level typical of classical GPS sources ($V_{S} &lt; 0.25$) at 4.7-22.3 GHz. When excluding the highly variable peaked-spectrum blazars, we expect no more than 20% of the sources in the sample to be GPS candidates and no more than 10% to be MPS candidates.</description>

      <title>CO in the Draco Nebula: The Atomic-Molecular Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents maps of the J=2-1 transition of CO toward the Draco Nebula Intermediate Velocity Cloud (IVC). The maps cover 8500 square arcmin with a velocity resolution of 0.33 km~s$^{-1}$ and angular resolution of 38", or 0.11 pc at the cloud distance of 600 pc. The mapped area includes all the emission detected by the {\it Herschel} satellite with 250 $\mu$m intensity &gt;5 MJy/sr. Previously published observations of the far-IR emission and the 21 cm line of HI are used to derive the column density distribution of H$_2$ and the abundance ratio CO/H$_2$, as well as the distribution of the molecular fraction of hydrogen, which approaches 90\% over much of the brighter parts of the nebula. The CO emission is highly clumpy and closely resembles the structures seen in far-IR images. The kinematics of the CO show supersonic motions between clumps but near-thermal to trans-sonic motions within clumps, consistent with model predictions that the scale length for dissipation of supersonic turbulence should be $\sim0.1$ pc, mediated by kinematic viscosity and/or ambipolar diffusion. Different parts of the nebula show evidence for a spread of molecular formation timescales of a few 10$^5$ years, comparable to the dynamical timescale of the infalling gas. The IVC will likely merge with the Galactic interstellar medium in $\sim 10^7$ years, and the densest clumps may form an unbound cluster of low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Gradient Technique Theory: Tracing magnetic field and obtaining magnetic field strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient technique is a promising tool with theoretical foundations based on the fundamental properties of MHD turbulence and turbulent reconnection. Its various incarnations use spectroscopic, synchrotron, and intensity data to trace the magnetic field and measure the media magnetization in terms of Alfven Mach number. We provide an analytical theory of gradient measurements and quantify the effects of averaging gradients along the line of sight and over the plane of the sky. We derive analytical expressions that relate the properties of gradient distribution with the Alfven Mach number $M_A$. We show that these measurements can be combined with measures of sonic Mach number or line broadening to obtain the magnetic field strength. The corresponding technique has advantages to Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi way of obtaining the magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann-Poisson equation with a central body: analytical solutions in one and two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an isothermal self-gravitating system surrounding a central body. This model can represent a galaxy or a globular cluster harboring a central black hole. It can also represent a gaseous atmosphere surrounding a protoplanet. In three dimensions, the Boltzmann-Poisson equation must be solved numerically in order to obtain the density profile of the gas [Chavanis {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 109}, 014118 (2024)]. In one and two dimensions, we show that the Boltzmann-Poisson equation can be solved analytically. We obtain explicit analytical expressions of the density profile around a central body which generalize the analytical solutions found by Camm (1950) and Ostriker (1964) in the absence of a central body. Our results also have applications for self-gravitating Brownian particles (Smoluchowski-Poisson system), for the chemotaxis of bacterial populations (Keller-Segel model), and for two-dimensional point vortices (Onsager's model). In the case of bacterial populations, the central body could represent a supply of ``food'' that attracts the bacteria (chemoattractant). In the case of two-dimensional vortices, the central body could be a central vortex</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the kinetic theory of stellar systems and two-dimensional vortices and stress their analogies. We recall the derivation of the Landau and Lenard-Balescu equations from the Klimontovich formalism. These equations take into account two-body correlations and are valid at the order $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of particles in the system. They have the structure of a Fokker-Planck equation involving a diffusion term and a drift term. The systematic drift of a vortex is the counterpart of the dynamical friction experienced by a star. At equilibrium, the diffusion and the drift terms balance each other establishing the Boltzmann distribution of statistical mechanics. We discuss the problem of kinetic blocking in certain cases and how it can be solved at the order $1/N^2$ by the consideration of three-body correlations. We also consider the behavior of the system close to the critical point following a recent suggestion by Hamilton and Heinemann (2023). We present a simple calculation, valid for spatially homogeneous systems with long-range interactions described by the Cauchy distribution, showing how the consideration of the Landau modes regularizes the divergence of the friction by polarization at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Dust evolution during the protostellar collapse: influence on the coupling between the neutral gas and the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between the magnetic field and the gas during the collapsing phase of star-forming cores is strongly affected by the dust size distribution, which is expected to evolve. We aim to investigate the influence of key parameters on the evolution of the dust distribution as well as on the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse. We perform collapsing single zone simulations with shark. The code computes the evolution of the dust distribution, accounting for different grain growth and destruction processes. It also computes the magnetic resistivities. We find that the dust distribution significantly evolves during the protostellar collapse, shaping the magnetic resistivities. The peak size of the distribution, the population of small grains and consequently the magnetic resistivities are controlled by both coagulation and fragmentation rates. Under standard assumptions, the small grains coagulate very early as they collide by ambipolar drift, yielding magnetic resistivities orders of magnitude away from the non-evolving dust case. In particular, the ambipolar resistivity \eta_AD is very high prior to nH=10^10 cm^-3, and as a consequence magnetic braking should be ineffective. In this case, large size protoplanetary disks should result, which is inconsistent with recent observations. To alleviate this tension, we identify mechanisms to reduce the ambipolar resistivity during the protostellar collapse. The most promising are namely: electrostatic repulsion and grain-grain erosion. The evolution of the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse and consequently the shape of the magnetic field in the early life of the protoplanetary disk strongly depends on the possibility to repopulate the small grains or to prevent their early coagulation. Therefore, it is crucial to better constrain the collision outcomes and the dust grain elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Progenitor mass and ejecta asymmetry of SN 2023ixf from nebular spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. SN 2023ixf was discovered in Galaxy M101 in May 2023. Its proximity made it an extremely valuable opportunity for the scientific community to study the characteristics of the SN and its progenitor. A point source detected on archival images and hydrodynamical modelling of the bolometric light curve has been used to constrain the former star's properties. There is a significant variation in the published results regarding the initial mass of the progenitor. Nebular spectroscopy provides an independent tool to enhance our understanding of the supernova and its progenitor. Aims. We determine the SN progenitor mass by studying the first published nebular spectrum taken 259 days after the explosion. Methods. We analyze the nebular spectrum taken with GMOS at the Gemini North Telescope. Typical emission lines are identified, such as [O I], H{\alpha}, [Ca II], among others. Some species' line profiles show broad and narrow components, indicating two ejecta velocities and an asymmetric ejecta. We infer the progenitor mass of SN 2023ixf by comparing with synthetic spectra and by measuring the forbidden oxygen doublet flux. Results. Based on the flux ratio and the direct comparison with spectra models, the progenitor star of SN 2023ixf had a M_{ZAMS} between 12 and 15 M{_\odot}. In comparison with this, we find the use of the [O I] doublet flux to be less constraining of the progenitor mass. Our results agree with those from hydrodynamical modelling of the early light curve and pre-explosion image estimates pointing to a relatively low-mass progenitor.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Crab Nebula with JWST: Pulsar wind, dusty filaments, and Ni/Fe abundance constraints on the explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST observations of the Crab Nebula, the iconic remnant of the historical SN 1054. The observations include NIRCam and MIRI imaging mosaics, plus MIRI/MRS IFU spectra that probe two select locations within the ejecta filaments. We derive a high-resolution map of dust emission and show that the grains are concentrated in the innermost, high-density filaments. These dense filaments coincide with multiple synchrotron bays around the periphery of the Crab's pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We measure synchrotron spectral index changes in small-scale features within the PWN's torus region, including the well-known knot and wisp structures. The index variations are consistent with Doppler boosting of emission from particles with a broken power-law distribution, providing the first direct evidence that the curvature in the particle injection spectrum is tied to the acceleration mechanism at the termination shock. We detect multiple nickel and iron lines in the ejecta filaments and use photoionization models to derive nickel-to-iron abundance ratios that are a factor of 3-8 higher than the solar ratio. We also find that the previously reported order-of-magnitude higher Ni/Fe values from optical data are consistent with the lower values from JWST when we reanalyze the optical emission using updated atomic data and account for local extinction from dust. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the nature of the explosion that produced the Crab Nebula and conclude that the observational properties are most consistent with a low-mass iron-core-collapse supernova, even though an electron-capture explosion cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Model Independent Radius Determination of Single FGK and M Dwarfs Using Gaia DR3 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring fundamental stellar parameters is key to fully comprehending the evolution of stars. However, current theoretical models over-predict effective temperatures, and under-predict radii, compared to observations of K and M dwarfs (radius inflation problem). In this work, we developed a model independent method to infer precise radii of single FGK and M dwarfs using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and photometry, and we used it to study the radius inflation problem. We calibrated nine surface brightness-color relations for the three Gaia magnitudes and colors using a sample of stars with angular diameter measurements. We achieved an accuracy of 4% in our angular diameter estimations, which Gaia's parallaxes allow us to convert to a physical radii. We validated our method by comparing our radius measurements with literature samples and the Gaia DR3 catalog, which confirmed the accuracy of our method and revealed systematic offsets in the Gaia measurements. Moreover, we used a sample with measured Halpha equivalent width (HaEW), a magnetic activity indicator, to study the radius inflation problem. We demonstrated that active stars have larger radii than inactive stars, showing that radius inflation is correlated with magnetic activity. We found a correlation between the radius inflation of active stars and HaEW for the mass bin 0.5&lt;M[Msun]&lt;= 0.6, but we found no correlation for lower masses. This could be due to lack of precision in our radius estimation or a physical reason. Radius measurements with smaller uncertainties are necessary to distinguish between the two scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we confront a class of $f(Q)$ gravity models with observational data of galaxy-galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider the $f(Q)$ gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with General Relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter $\alpha$. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting the spherically symmetric solutions which correspond to the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameter in a two-fold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to $r^{-2}$. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective Excess Surface Density (ESD) profile. After that, we employ the group catalog and shape catalog from the SDSS DR7 for the lens and source samples respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using the MCMC. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive $\alpha=1.202^{+0.277}_{-0.179}\times 10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-2}$ at 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by applying the AIC and BIC information criteria. Our results indicate that the $f(Q)$ corrections alongside off-center effects yield a scenario that is slightly favored.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is closely connected to their host galaxies and surroundings. Via feedback processes, AGN can counteract the cooling of the intracluster medium (ICM) and suppress star formation in their host galaxies. Radio observations at low frequencies provide a glimpse into the history of AGN activity. The Virgo cluster is a substantial reservoir of nearby galaxies and provides an ideal laboratory for the study of AGN as well as their feedback mechanisms. The aim of our work is to characterise the AGN population within the Virgo cluster down to low radio luminosities, constrain the AGN duty cycle and investigate environmental feedback in cluster member galaxies. We analyse 144 MHz and 1.3 GHz radio observations of early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS) taken with LOFAR and MeerKAT. We detect 12 of these galaxies at 144 MHz, 5 of which show clearly extended radio emission. The radio luminosity shows a strong dependence on the stellar mass of the host galaxy, in agreement with previous results. As a notable outlier, the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 4365 ($M_* = 2.2 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$) is not detected as a compact source in the LOFAR observations. Instead, it is surrounded by diffuse, low-surface brightness emission, which hints towards a past phase of stronger nuclear activity. Furthermore, we find a cavity in NGC 4472 (= M 49) inflated by the wide-angle tail only visible in the LOFAR data, which implies that the cavity was created by a past outburst. The corresponding cavity power is of the same order of magnitude as the jet power in the present duty cycle of the AGN.</description>

      <title>An absence of binary companions to Wolf-Rayet stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud: implications for mass loss and black hole masses at low metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to predict the black hole mass distributions at high redshift, we need to understand whether very massive single stars ($M&gt;40$ M$_\odot$) at low metallicity $Z$ lose their hydrogen-rich envelopes, like their metal-rich counterparts, or whether a binary companion is required to achieve this. To test this, we undertake a deep spectroscopic search for binary companions of the seven apparently single Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; $Z \simeq 1/5 Z_\odot$). For each of them, we acquired six high-quality VLT-UVES spectra spread over 1.5 years. By using the narrow N V lines in these spectra, we monitor radial velocity (RV) variations to search for binary motion. We find low RV variations between 6 and 23 km/s for the seven WR stars, with a median standard deviation of $5$ km/s. Our Monte Carlo simulations imply probabilities below ~5% for any of our target WR stars to have a binary companion more massive than ~5 M$_\odot$ at orbital periods of less than a year. We estimate that the probability that all our target WR stars have companions with orbital periods shorter than 10 yr is below ~10$^{-5}$, and argue that the observed modest RV variations may originate from intrinsic atmosphere or wind variability. Our findings imply that metal-poor massive stars born with $M \gtrsim 40$ M$_\odot$ can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes via stellar winds or eruptive mass loss, which strongly constrains their initial mass - black hole mass relation. We also identify two of our seven target stars (SMC AB1 and SMC AB11) as runaway stars with a peculiar radial velocity of ~80 km/s. Moreover, with all five previously detected WR binaries in the SMC exhibiting orbital periods of below 20 d, a puzzling absence of intermediate-to-long-period WR binaries has emerged, with strong implications for the outcome of massive binary interaction at low metallicity.</description>

      <title>Observational tests in scale invariance III: wide binary stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of wide binary stars based on Gaia DR3 suggest that the relative orbital velocities of objects with separations s &gt; 3'000 astronomical units are statistically larger than the standard Newtonian predictions. Obviously there is no Dark Matter halo arround binary stars that could be invoked to explain these high velocities. However, we explore the properties of two-body systems in the framework of scale invariant vacuum theory, focusing on the case of objects with extreme separations. In this regime, the additional acceleration term present in the modified Newton equation with scale invariance becomes important, and may even dominate the dynamical evolution at very low gravities. Comparisons with Gaia DR3 observations of wide binaries are performed and suggest that binaries with separations s &gt; 3'000 astronomical units have experienced such an evolution for a few Gyr, accounting well for the observed velocity excesses.</description>

Abstract: Our goal is to study the gravitational effects caused by the passage of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in its orbit on the stellar halo of the Milky Way (MW). We employed the Gaia Data Release 3 to construct a halo tracers data set consisting of K-Giant stars and RR-Lyrae variables. Additionally, we have compared the data with a theoretical model to estimate the DM subhalo mass. We have improved the characterisation of the local wake and the collective response due to the LMC orbit. On the other hand, we have estimated for the first time the dark subhalo mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud, of the order of $1.7\times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, comparable to previously reported values in the literature.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Free Starbursts at Cosmic Dawn: Observable Predictions for JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the analysis of a physical model within the standard cosmology that robustly predicts a high star-formation efficiency (SFE) in massive galaxies at cosmic dawn due to feedback-free starbursts (FFBs). It implies an excess of bright galaxies at z&gt;~10 compared to the standard models based on the low SFE at later epochs, an excess indicated by JWST observations. Here we provide observable predictions based on the analytic FFB scenario. These can be compared with simulations and JWST observations. We approximate the SFE as a function of redshift and mass, assuming a maximum SFE of 0.2~1 in the FFB regime. From this, we derive the evolution of the galaxy mass and luminosity functions as well as the evolution of stellar and star-formation densities. We then predict the star-formation history (SFH), galaxy sizes, outflows, gas fractions, metallicities, and dust attenuation, all as functions of mass and redshift in the FFB regime. The major distinguishing feature is the occurrence of FFBs above a mass threshold that declines with redshift. The luminosities and star formation rates in bright galaxies are predicted to be in excess of extrapolations of standard empirical models and cosmological simulations, an excess that grows from z~9 to higher redshifts. The FFB phase of ~100 Myr is predicted to show a characteristic SFH that fluctuates on a timescale of ~10 Myr. The stellar systems are compact (Re~0.3 kpc at z~10 and declining with z). The galactic gas consists of a steady wind driven by supernovae from earlier generations, with high outflow velocities (FWHM~1400-6700km/s), low gas fractions (&lt;0.1), low metallicities (&lt;~0.1 solar), and low dust attenuation ($A_{UV}$~0.5 at z~10 and declining with z). We make tentative comparisons with current JWST observations for initial insights, anticipating more complete and reliable datasets for detailed quantitative comparisons in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has recently detected numerous disc galaxies at high-redshifts and there have been observations of cold disc galaxies at z &gt; 4 with ALMA. In the Milky Way, recent studies find metal-poor stars in cold disc orbits, suggesting an ancient disc. We investigated a sample of 565,606 stars from the hybrid-CNN analysis of the Gaia-DR3 RVS stars. The sample contains 8,500 stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-1. For a subset of ~200,000 MSTO and subgiant stars we computed distances and ages using the StarHorse code with a mean precision of 1% and 12%, respectively. First, we confirm the existence of metal-poor stars in thin disc orbits - over 50% are older than 13 Gyr. Second, we report the discovery of the oldest thin disc of the Milky Way(MW), which extends across a wide range of metallicities, from metal-poor to super-solar stars. The metal-poor stars in disc orbits manifest as a readily visible tail of the metallicity distribution. The high-[{\alpha}/Fe] thick disc exhibits a vertical velocity dispersion of 35 km/s, while the thin disc shows 10 to 15 km/s lower at similar ages. Our old thin disc $\sigma_{V_z}$ appears similar to those estimated for the high-z disc galaxies. Third, we extend the [Y/Mg] chemical clock to the oldest ages and estimate a slope of -0.038 dex/Gyr. Finally, we confirm our discovery by showing that the splash includes high- and low-[{\alpha}/Fe] populations that are both old and extends to super-solar [Fe/H]. We find about 6 to 10% of the old thin disc was heated to thick disc orbits with the youngest splashed stars being 9 to 10 Gyrs. We conclude the MW thin disc forms &lt;1 billion years from Big Bang, building up inside-out, preceding earlier estimates by about 4-5 billion years. Considering a massive merger event such as the GSE, a Splash is expected - we find a portion of the old thin disc is heated to thick disc velocities and the Splash extends to super-solar [Fe/H] regimes.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ Emission Strength and Stellar Properties of Faint Galaxies from $5 &lt; z &lt; 8.2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on stellar properties of Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emitters at 5 $&lt; z &lt;$ 8.2. We use 247 photometrically-selected, lensed, high-redshift, low luminosity galaxy candidates with spectroscopic follow-up. Of these, 38 are confirmed spectroscopically to be between 5 $&lt; z &lt;$ 8.2 via detection of Ly$\alpha$. For each galaxy and candidate, we estimate stellar mass, star formation rate, specific star formation rate, and mass-weighted age with spectral energy distribution fitting. We also measure the UV $\beta$ slope and luminosity using values from photometry. We find no strong correlation between Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width and any of these properties, as well as no significant difference between the physical properties of Ly$\alpha$ emitters and candidates without Ly$\alpha$ detected. This lack of expected trends may be explained by a combination of the evolving opacity of the IGM at these redshifts as well as the unique phase space probed by our lensed sample. Via tests on other galaxy samples which show varying strengths of correlations, we conclude that if there exist any relationships between Ly$\alpha$ EW and physical properties in the underlying population of faint galaxies, they are weak correlations. We also present the results of a spectroscopic search for CIII] emission in confirmed Ly$\alpha$ emitters at $z \sim 7$, finding no CIII] detections, but putting constraints on strong AGN activity and extreme nebular emission.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance Method in the Near Infrared. I. HST WFC3/IR F110W and F160W Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distance method in the I band is one of the most efficient and precise techniques for measuring distances to nearby galaxies (D &lt;= 15 Mpc). The TRGB in the near infrared (NIR) is 1 to 2 magnitudes brighter relative to the I band, and has the potential to expand the range over which distance measurements to nearby galaxies are feasible. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of 12 fields in 8 nearby galaxies, we determine color-based corrections and zero points of the TRGB in the Wide Field Camera 3 IR (WFC3/IR) F110W and F160W filters. First, we measure TRGB distances in the I band equivalent Advanced Camera System (ACS) F814W filter from resolved stellar populations with the HST. The TRGB in the ACS F814W filter is used for our distance anchor and to place the WFC3/IR magnitudes on an absolute scale. We then determine the color dependence (a proxy for metallicity/age) and zero point of the NIR TRGB from photometry of WFC3/IR fields which overlap with the ACS fields. The new calibration is accurate to ~1% in distance, relative to the F814W TRGB. Validating the accuracy of the calibrations, we find that the distance modulus for each field using the NIR TRGB calibration agrees with the distance modulus of the same fields as determined from the F814W TRGB. This is a JWST preparatory program and the work done here will directly inform our approach to calibrating the TRGB in JWST NIRCam and NIRISS photometric filters.</description>

      <title>The Environmental Dependence of the Stellar Mass - Gas Metallicity Relation in Horizon Run 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallicity offers a unique window into the baryonic history of the cosmos, being instrumental in probing evolutionary processes in galaxies between different cosmic environments. We aim to quantify the contribution of these environments to the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) of galaxies. By analysing the galaxy distribution within the cosmic skeleton of the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation at redshift $z = 0.625$, computed using a careful calibration of the T-ReX filament finder, we identify galaxies within three main environments: nodes, filaments and voids. We also classify galaxies based on the dynamical state of the clusters and the length of the filaments in which they reside. We find that the cosmic environment significantly contributes to the scatter in the MZR; in particular, both the gas metallicity and its average relative standard deviation increase when considering denser large-scale environments. The difference in the average metallicity between galaxies within relaxed and unrelaxed clusters is $\approx 0.1 \text{ dex}$, with both populations displaying positive residuals, $\delta Z_{g}$, from the averaged MZR. Moreover, the difference in metallicity between node and void galaxies accounts for $\approx 0.14 \, \text{dex}$ in the scatter of the MZR at stellar mass $M_{\star} \approx 10^{9.35}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$. Finally, both the average [O/Fe] in the gas and the galaxy gas fraction decrease when moving to higher large-scale densities in the simulation, suggesting that the cores of cosmic environments host, on average, older and more massive galaxies, whose enrichment is affected by a larger number of Type Ia Supernova events.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes with PRIMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most active phases of star formation and black hole accretion are strongly affected by dust extinction, making far-infrared (far-IR) observations the best way to disentangle and study the co-evolution of galaxies and super massive black holes. The plethora of fine structure lines and emission features from dust, ionised and neutral atomic and warm molecular gas in the rest-frame mid- and far-IR provide unmatched diagnostic power to determine the properties of gas and dust, measure gas-phase metallicities and map cold galactic outflows in even the most obscured galaxies. By combining multi-band photometric surveys with low and high-resolution far-IR spectroscopy, the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA), a concept for a far-IR, 1.8m-diameter, cryogenically cooled observatory, will revolutionise the field of galaxy evolution by taking advantage of this IR toolkit to find and study dusty galaxies across galactic time. In this work, we make use of the phenomenological simulation SPRITZ and the Santa Cruz semi-analytical model to describe how a moderately deep multi-band PRIMA photometric survey can easily reach beyond previous IR missions to detect and study galaxies down to $10^{11}\,L_{\odot}$ beyond cosmic noon and at least up to z=4, even in the absence of gravitational lensing. By decomposing the spectral energy distribution (SED) of these photometrically selected galaxies, we show that PRIMA can be used to accurately measure the relative AGN power, the mass fraction contributed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and the total IR luminosity. At the same time, spectroscopic follow up with PRIMA will allow to trace both the star formation and black hole accretion rates (SFR, BHAR), the gas phase metallicities and the mass outflow rates of cold gas in hundreds to thousands of individual galaxies to z=2.</description>

      <title>Environmental Effects on the Stellar Mass Function in a z~3.3 Overdensity of Galaxies in the COSMOS Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the number density of galaxies as a function of stellar mass (i.e., the stellar mass function, SMF) in the COSMOS field at z~3.3, making a comparison between the SMF in overdense environments and the SMF in the coeval field. In particular, this region contains the Elent\'ari proto-supercluster, a system of 6 extended overdensities spanning ~70 cMpc on a side. A clear difference is seen in the high-mass slope of these SMFs, with overdense regions showing an increase in the ratio of high-mass galaxies to low-mass galaxies relative to the field, indicating a more rapid build-up of stellar mass in overdense environments. This result qualitatively agrees with analyses of clusters at z~1, though the differences between protocluster and field SMFs at z~3.3 are smaller. While this is consistent with overdensities enhancing the evolution of their member galaxies, potentially through increased merger rates, whether this enhancement begins in protocluster environments or even earlier in group environments is still unclear. Though the measured fractions of quiescent galaxies between the field and overdense environments do not vary significantly, implying that this stellar mass enhancement is ongoing and any starbursts triggered by merger activity have not yet quenched, we note that spectroscopic observations are biased towards star-forming populations, particularly for low-mass galaxies. If mergers are indeed responsible, high resolution imaging of Elent\'ari and similar structures at these early epochs should then reveal increased merger rates relative to the field. Larger samples of well-characterized overdensities are necessary to draw broader conclusions in these areas.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Structure and Self-gravity in the Maddalena Giant Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19766</link>

Abstract: In this work, we present the data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project for the Maddalena giant molecular cloud (GMC). We decompose the 13CO emission datacube of the observed region into hierarchical substructures using a modified Dendrogram algorithm. We investigate the statistical properties of these substructures and examine the role that self-gravity plays on various spatial scales. The statistics of the mass (M), radius (R), velocity dispersion ({\sigma}v), virial parameter ({\alpha}vir), and sonic Mach number of the substructures are presented. The radius and mass distributions and the {\sigma}v-R scaling relationship of the substructures resemble those reported in previous studies that use non-hierarchical algorithms to identify the entities. We find that for the hierarchical substructures {\alpha}vir decreases as the radius or mass of the substructures increases. The majority of the substructures in the quiescent region of Maddalena GMC are not gravitationally bound ({\alpha}vir &gt; 2), while most of the substructures in the star-forming regions are gravitationally bound ({\alpha}vir &lt; 2). Furthermore, we find that self-gravity plays an important role on scales of 0.8-4 pc in the IRAS 06453 star-forming region, while it is not an important factor on scales below 5 pc in the non-star-forming region.</description>

      <title>Demographics of Tidal Disruption Events with L-Galaxies: I. Volumetric TDE rates and the abundance of Nuclear Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13242</link>

Abstract: Stars can be ripped apart by tidal forces in the vicinity of a massive black hole (MBH), causing luminous flares known as tidal disruption events (TDEs). These events could be contributing to the mass growth of intermediate-mass MBHs, and new samples from transient surveys can provide useful information on this growth channel. This work aims to study the demographics of TDEs by modeling the co-evolution of MBHs and their galactic environments in a cosmological framework. We use the semi-analytic galaxy formation model \emph{L-Galaxies}BH, which follows the evolution of galaxies as well as of MBHs, including multiple scenarios for MBH seeds and growth, spin evolution, and binary MBH dynamics. Time-dependent TDE rates are associated with each MBH depending on the stellar environment, following the solutions to the 1-D Fokker Planck equation solved with \textsc{PhaseFlow}. Our model produces volumetric rates that are in agreement with the latest optical and previous X-ray samples. This agreement requires a high occupation fraction of nuclear star clusters with MBHs since these star reservoirs host the majority of TDEs at all mass regimes. We predict that TDE rates are an increasing function of MBH mass up to $\sim\, 10^{5.5}$M$_\odot$, beyond which the distribution flattens and eventually drops for $&gt;\,10^{7}$M$_\odot$. In general, volumetric rates are predicted to be redshift-independent at $z\,{&lt;}\,1$. We discuss how the spin distribution of MBHs around the event horizon suppression can be constrained via TDE rates and what is the average contribution of TDEs to the MBH growth. In our work, the majority of low-mass galaxies host nuclear star clusters that have their loss-cone depleted by $z\,=\,0$, explaining why TDEs are rare in these systems. This highlights that time-dependent TDE rates are essential for any model to be in good agreement with observations at all mass regimes.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters -- II. Discovery of Brown Dwarfs in NGC 6397 and Measurement of Age from the Brown Dwarf Cooling Sequence, using SANDee - a New Grid of Model Isochrones across the Hydrogen-Burning Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01634</link>

Abstract: Globular clusters contain vast repositories of metal-poor stars that represent some of the oldest stellar generations in the Universe. The archaeological footprint of early Galactic evolution may be retained in the measurable properties of globular clusters, such as their ages, mass functions and chemical abundances. Until recently, all photometric studies of globular clusters were restricted to stellar members. Now, the sensitivity of JWST can extend this analysis to the substellar regime. If detected in sufficient numbers, brown dwarf members can provide tight constraints on the properties of their parent population. We present SANDee - a new grid of stellar models that accurately represent the color-magnitude diagrams of globular clusters across the hydrogen-burning limit at a wide range of metallicities. Using JWST NIRCam photometry and the new models, we identify three brown dwarfs in the globular cluster NGC 6397 with effective temperatures of 1300-1800 K, confirmed by both proper motion and model fitting. We use the observed luminosities of discovered brown dwarfs to obtain the first age estimate of a globular cluster from its substellar cooling sequence: 13.4 +/- 3.3 Gyr. We also derive the local mass function of the cluster across the hydrogen-burning limit and find it to be top-heavy, suggesting extensive dynamical evolution. We expect that the constraints on both age and mass function of NGC 6397 derived in this work can be greatly improved by a second epoch of NIRCam imaging in the same field.</description>
