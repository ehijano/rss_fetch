      <title>Theory of anomalous Hall effect from screened vortex charge in a phase disordered superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments showing evidence for chiral superconductivity in an anomalous Hall phase of tetralayer graphene, we study the relation between the normal state anomalous Hall conductivity and that in the phase disordered state above the critical temperature of the superconductor. By a numerical calculation of superconductivity in an anomalous Hall metal, we find that a difference in vortex and antivortex charge is determined by the Fermi surface Berry phase. Combining this with the vortex dynamics in a back-ground supercurrent leads to a Hall response in the phase disordered state of the superconductor that is close to the normal state anomalous Hall response. However, using a gauge-invariant superconducting response framework, we find that while vortex charge is screened by interactions, the screening charge, after a time-delay, reappears in the longitudinal current. Thus, the dc Hall conductivity in this phase, instead of matching the screened vortex charge, matches the ac Hall conductance in the superconducting and normal phase, which are similar.</description>

      <title>Orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in 2H-NbS2 flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking in a layered superconductor with Ising spin-orbit coupling has offered an opportunity to realize unconventional superconductivity. To be more specific, orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, exhibiting layer-dependent finite-momentum pairing, may emerge in transition metal dichalcogenides materials (TMDC) in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Orbital FFLO state can be more robust against the magnetic field than the conventional superconducting state with zero-momentum pairing. This feature renders its potential in field resilient superconducting functionality. Although, orbital FFLO state has been reported in NbSe2 and MoS2, it is not yet clear if orbital FFLO state can be a general feature of TMDC superconductor. Here, we report the observation of orbital FFLO state in 2H-NbS2 flakes and its dependence on the thickness of flake. We conclude that the relatively weak interlayer coupling is instrumental in stabilizing orbital FFLO state at higher temperature with respect to the critical temperature and lower magnetic field with respect to paramagnetic limit in NbS2 in comparison to its NbSe2 counterpart.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior and level spacing statistics in a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [K. Swaminathan et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043215 (2023)], we introduce the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor, in order to better understand the quasiparticle localization and interesting coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior present in the former model. The OBS model is the sum of terms that have direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian, each of which is parameterized by a coupling constant. Exact diagonalization reveals that the energy spectrum and non-equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model are essentially the same as that of the dice lattice for some values of the coupling constants. The quasiparticle localization and breaking of ergodicity manifest in a striking manner in the level spacing distribution. Its near Poissonian form provides evidence for the existence of local integrals of motion and establishes the OBS model as a non-trivial integrable generalization of the projected Creutz ladder Hamiltonian. These results show that level spacing statistics is a promising tool to study quasiparticle excitations in flat band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Multiphase superconductivity in PdBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity, where electron pairing does not involve electron-phonon interactions, is often attributed to magnetic correlations in a material. Well known examples include high-T_c cuprates and uranium-based heavy fermion superconductors. Less explored are unconventional superconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, where interactions between spin-polarised electrons and external magnetic field can result in multiple superconducting phases and field-induced transitions between them, a rare phenomenon in the superconducting state. Here we report a magnetic-field driven phase transition in \beta-PdBi2, a layered non-magnetic superconductor. Our tunnelling spectroscopy on thin PdBi2 monocrystals incorporated in planar superconductor-insulator-normal metal junctions reveals a marked discontinuity in the superconducting properties with increasing in-plane field, which is consistent with a transition from conventional (s-wave) to nodal pairing. Our theoretical analysis suggests that this phase transition may arise from spin polarisation and spin-momentum locking caused by locally broken inversion symmetry, with p-wave pairing becoming energetically favourable in high fields. Our findings also reconcile earlier predictions of unconventional multigap superconductivity in \beta-PdBi2 with previous experiments where only a single s-wave gap could be detected.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Relaxation Oscillations in Superconducting Nanobridge Single Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate novel laser-induced relaxation oscillations in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). These oscillations appear when a voltage biased NbTiN nanobridge detector is illuminated with intense pulsed laser light at a repetition rate of ~19 MHz. They differ from the well-known relaxation oscillations by a step-wise increase in frequency and phase locking of the oscillations to the laser pulses. An electrical model that does not include thermal effects can be used to simulate the observed laser-induced relaxation oscillations. Good agreement to the experiment is achieved using realistic values for the parameters in the model.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Kohn-Luttinger topological superconductivity in bands with nontrivial geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the electron wavefunction on Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity. The role of the wavefunction is encoded in a complex form factor describing the topology and geometry of the bands. We show that the electron wavefunction significantly impacts the superconducting transition temperature and superconducting order parameter. We illustrate this using the lowest Landau level form factor and find exponential enhancement of $T_c$ for the resulting topological superconductor. We find that the ideal band geometry, which favors a fractional Chern insulator in the flat band limit, has an optimal $T_c$. Finally, we apply this understanding to a model relevant to rhombohedral graphene multilayers and unravel the importance of the band geometry for achieving robust superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.</description>

      <title>AI-driven inverse design of materials: Past, present and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, particularly such as the one based density functional theory, as well as high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</description>

      <title>New Limits for Existence of Transverse Zero Sound in Fermi Liquid 3He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Landau predicted that transverse sound propagates in a Fermi liquid with sufficiently strong Fermi liquid interactions, unlike a classical fluid which cannot support shear oscillations. Previous attempts to observe this unique collective mode yielded inconclusive results due to contributions from single particle excitations. Here, we have microfabricated acoustic cavities with a micron-scale path length that is suitable for direct detection of this sound mode. The interference fringes of these acoustic Fabry-Perot cavities can be used to determine both the real and imaginary parts of the acoustic impedance. We report a null-result in this search as no clear interference fringe has been observed in the Fermi liquid, indicating the attenuation of TZS is likely above 2000 cm^-1. We provide theoretical justification for why the sound mode may yet exist but not being directly detectable due to high attenuation.</description>
