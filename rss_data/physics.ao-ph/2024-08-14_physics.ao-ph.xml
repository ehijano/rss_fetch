      <title>Symmetric influence of forward and opposing tidal currents on rogue wave statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rogue waves are associated with various ocean processes, both at the coast and in the open ocean. In either zone, inhomogeneities in the wave field caused by shoaling, crossing seas or current interactions disturb wave statistics, increasing rogue wave probability and magnitude. Such amplification of the frequency of rogue waves and their intensity, i.e. the maximum normalized height, have been attested in numerical simulations and laboratory studies, in particular for wave-current interactions. In this study, we investigate the effect of the current intensity and direction on rogue wave probability, by analyzing long-term observations from the southern North Sea. We observe that the amplification is similar for opposing and following currents. Despite the sea states being dominantly broad-banded and featuring a large directional spread, anomalous statistics are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in unidirectional laboratory experiments for stationary currents.</description>

      <title>On Long-Crested Ocean Rogue Waves Originating From Localized Amplitude and Frequency Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rogue waves are known to occur on the ocean surface leading to significant damage to marine installations and compromising ship safety. Understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for extreme wave focusing is crucial in order to predict and prevent their formation and impact. Two intensively discussed wave amplification frameworks are the linear and nonlinear focusing mechanisms. These are also known as superposition principle and modulation instability, respectively. We report an experimental study investigating the formation mechanism in a unidirectional representative JONSWAP-type sea state and show that the nonlinear focusing mechanism can be sub-categorized into either a localized amplitude or a so far less-studied phase-related frequency modulation, or both being at play. The frequency modulation-type mechanism occurs at a lower probability, as suggested from the distribution of more than 200 extreme events, however, it cannot be underrated or disregarded.</description>

      <title>Quantification of salt transports due to exchange flow and tidal flow in estuaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand mechanisms of salt intrusion in estuaries, we develop a semi-analytical model, that explicitly accounts for salt transport by both exchange flow and tidal flow. This model, after calibration, successfully hindcasts hydrodynamics and salinity dynamics in three estuaries that have strongly different characteristics. We find, from analyzing the model results for these three estuaries, that salt transport processes by exchange flow and tidal flow interact through the subtidal stratification. Transport by exchange flow creates stratification, thereby generating a phase shift of tidal salinity with respect to the tidal flow, which is important for the magnitude of the tidal salt transport. Conversely, the strength of tidal currents determines the vertical mixing that breaks down stratification. A new analytical formulation is presented for the component of the salt transport driven by the depth-averaged tidal flow. This salt transport is larger than the component associated with the vertical shear of the tidal current. Finally, a method that yields analytical equations that quantify the importance of different contributions to the salt transport using only primary information is developed using approximate solutions for the subtidal stratification. This method performs well for the estuaries considered.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Sea Level Rise near Shanghai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Firstly, by establishing a prediction model for global sea-level rise and calculating with Maple, it is shown that the global sea-level rise rate in 2009 is 2.68 mm/a. The height and rate of global sea-level rise will be about 9.11 cm and 3.22 mm/a in 2020. Based on the study and the actual land subsidence in Shanghai Lingang New City, the rate of relative sea-level rise near Lingang New City is calculated to be 12.68 mm/a in 2009. Then, through setting up the extrapolation prediction model with a linear trend term and a significant tidal cycle, the rise rate of average sea-level near Lingang New City was predicted. The result showed it will be 0.33 mm/a in 2020.</description>

      <title>MetMamba: Regional Weather Forecasting with Spatial-Temporal Mamba Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06400v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning based Weather Prediction (DLWP) models have been improving rapidly over the last few years, surpassing state of the art numerical weather forecasts by significant margins. While much of the optimization effort is focused on training curriculum to extend forecast range in the global context, two aspects remains less explored: limited area modeling and better backbones for weather forecasting. We show in this paper that MetMamba, a DLWP model built on a state-of-the-art state-space model, Mamba, offers notable performance gains and unique advantages over other popular backbones using traditional attention mechanisms and neural operators. We also demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning based limited area modeling via coupled training with a global host model.</description>

      <title>A global summary of seafloor topography influenced by turbulent water mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent water motions are important for the exchange of momentum, heat, nutrients, and suspended matter including sediments in the deep-sea that is generally stably stratified in density. To maintain ocean-density stratification, an irreversible diapycnal turbulent transport is needed. The geological shape and texture of marine topography is important for water mixing as most of deep-sea turbulence is generated via breaking internal waves at sloping seafloors. For example, slopes of semidiurnal internal tidal characteristics can critically match the mean seafloor slope. In this paper, the concept of critical slopes are revisited from a global internal wave-turbulence viewpoint seafloor topography -- and using moored high-resolution temperature sensor data. Observations suggest that turbulence generation via internal wave breaking at 5+/-1.5% of all seafloors is sufficient to maintain ocean-density stratification. However most, &gt;90%, turbulence contribution is found at supercritical, rather than the more limited critical, slopes measured at 1-minute-scales that cover about 50% of seafloors at water depths &lt; 2000 m. Internal tides (about 60%) dominate over near-inertial waves (about 40%), which is confirmed from comparison of NE-Atlantic data with East-Mediterranean data (no tides). Seafloor-elevation spectra show a wavenumber (k) fall-off rate of k^-3, which is steeper than previously found. The fall-off rate is even steeper, resulting in less elevation-variance, in a one-order-of-magnitude bandwidth around k_T=0.5 cycle-per-km. The corresponding length is equivalent to the internal tidal excursion. The reduction in seafloor-elevation variance seems associated with erosion by internal wave breaking. Potential robustness of the seafloor-internal wave interaction is discussed.</description>

      <title>Dwellers in the Deep: Biological Consequences of Dark Oxygen</title>

Abstract: The striking recent putative detection of "dark oxygen" (dark O$_2$) sources on the abyssal ocean floor in the Pacific at $\sim 4$ km depth raises the intriguing scenario that complex (i.e., animal-like) life could exist in underwater environments sans oxygenic photosynthesis. In this work, we thus explore the possible (astro)biological implications of this discovery. From the available data, we roughly estimate the concentration of dissolved O$_2$ and the corresponding O$_2$ partial pressure, as well as the flux of O$_2$ production, associated with dark oxygen sources. Based on these values, we infer that organisms limited by internal diffusion may reach maximal sizes of $\sim 0.1-1$ mm in habitats with dark O$_2$, while those with circulatory systems might achieve sizes of $\sim 0.1-10$ cm. Optimistically, the estimated dark oxygen flux can potentially support biomass densities up to $\sim 3-30$ g m$^{-2}$, perhaps surpassing typical reported densities at similar depths in global deep-sea surveys. Finally, we outline how oceanic settings with dark O$_2$ may facilitate the origin(s) of life via the emergence of electrotrophy. Our findings indicate that complex life fueled by dark oxygen is plausibly capable of inhabiting submarine environments devoid of photosynthesis on Earth, conceivably extending likewise to extraterrestrial locations such as icy worlds with subsurface oceans (e.g., Enceladus and Europa), which are likely common throughout the Universe.</description>

      <title>A statistical physics and dynamical systems perspective on geophysical extreme events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical physics and dynamical systems theory are key tools to study high-impact geophysical events such as temperature extremes, cyclones, thunderstorms, geomagnetic storms and many more. Despite the intrinsic differences between these events, they all originate as temporary deviations from the typical trajectories of a geophysical system, resulting in well-organised, coherent structures at characteristic spatial and temporal scales. While statistical extreme value analysis techniques are capable to provide return times and probabilities of occurrence of certain geophysical events, they are not apt to account for their underlying physics. Their focus is to compute the probability of occurrence of events that are large or small with respect to some specific observable (e.g. temperature, precipitation, solar wind), rather than to relate rare or extreme phenomena to the underlying anomalous geophysical regimes. This paper outlines this knowledge gap, presenting some related challenges, new formalisms and briefly commenting on how stochastic approaches tailored to the study of extreme geophysical events can help to advance their understanding.</description>

      <title>Utility of ocean wave parameters in ambient noise prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is concerned with prediction of the "wind noise" component of ambient noise (AN) in the ocean. It builds on the seminal paper by Felizardo and Melville (1995), in which the authors quantified the correlation between AN and individual wind/wave parameters. Acoustic data are obtained from hydrophones at six diverse locations, and wind/wave parameters are obtained from moored buoys and numerical models. We describe a procedure developed for this study which identifies correlation of AN with wave parameters, independent of their mutual correlation with wind speed. We then describe paired calibration/prediction experiments, whereby multiple wind/wave parameters are used simultaneously to estimate AN. We find that the improvement from inclusion of wave parameters is robust but marginal: typically RMSE is reduced by less than 0.3 dB and/or less than 12% of the original RMSE. We interpret the latter outcome as suggesting that wave breaking responds to changes in local winds quickly, relative to, for example, total wave energy, which develops more slowly. This outcome is consistent with prior knowledge of the physics of wave breaking, e.g. Babanin (2011). We discuss this in context of the time/space response of various wave parameters to wind forcing.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Super-Resolution Simulation Method of Three-Dimensional Street-Scale Atmospheric Flows for Real-Time Urban Micrometeorology Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-stage super-resolution simulation method is proposed for street-scale air temperature and wind velocity, which considerably reduces the computation time while maintaining accuracy. The first stage employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to correct large-scale flows above buildings in the input low-resolution (LR) simulation results. The second stage uses another CNN to reconstruct small-scale flows between buildings from the output of the first stage, resulting in high-resolution (HR) inferences. The CNNs are trained using HR simulation data for the second stage and their coarse-grained version for the first stage as the ground truth, where the HR simulations are conducted independently of the LR simulations used as input. This learning approach separates the spatial scales of inference in each stage. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using micrometeorological simulations in an actual urban area around Tokyo Station in Japan. The super-resolution simulation successfully inferred HR atmospheric flows, reducing errors by approximately 50% for air temperature and 60% for wind velocity compared to the LR simulations. Furthermore, the two-stage approach allowed for localized HR inferences, reducing GPU memory usage to as low as 12% during the training phase. The total wall-clock time for 60-min predictions was reduced to 6.83 min, which was approximately 3.32% of the HR simulation time (206 min). The proposed method demonstrates the potential for real-time micrometeorology predictions in urban areas with a combination of physics-based and data-driven models.</description>
