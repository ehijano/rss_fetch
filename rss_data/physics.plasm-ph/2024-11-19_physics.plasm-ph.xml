      <title>Magnetized ICF implosions: Non-axial magnetic field topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores 4 different magnetic field topologies for application to spherical inertial confinement fusion implosions: axial, mirror, cusp and closed field lines. A mirror field is found to enhance the impact of magnetization over an axial field; this is because the mirror field more closely follows the hot-spot surface. A cusp field, while simple to generate, is not found to have any benefits over the tried-and-tested axial field. Closed field lines are found to be of the greatest benefit to hot-spot performance, with the simulated design undergoing a 2x increase in ion temperature before alpha-heating is considered. The plasma properties of the simulation with closed field lines are radically different from the unmagnetized counterpart, with electron temperatures in excess of 100 keV, suggesting that a fundamental redesign of the capsule implosion is possible if this method is pursued.</description>

      <title>Charge-exchange measurements of high-energy fast ions in LHD using negative-ion neutral beam injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new sightline geometry for the fast-ion D-alpha (FIDA) diagnostic on the Large Helical Device (LHD) has been confirmed to measure signals for high-energy fast ions produced by negative-ion neutral beam injection. The newly installed sightline uses a 180 keV tangential negative-ion neutral beamline as the active source. Due to the small angle between the beamline and FIDA sightline, the relative velocity between fast ions and injected neutrals is small. This allows for high-energy fast ions just below the beam injection energy to produce measurable Doppler-shifted FIDA emission. Experiments were conducted at LHD in order to compare the new sightline, which views a high-energy negative-ion tangential beamline, and the old sightline, which views a low-energy perpendicular positive-ion neutral beamline. The measured FIDA signal is validated against predictions from the synthetic fast-ion diagnostic code FIDASIM with a distribution function modelled by the 5D transport code GNET. The results of the experiment confirm that reducing the viewing angle with a tangential active beam allows FIDA diagnostic to view high-energy fast ions with a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Resilient Stellarator Divertor Characteristics in the Helically Symmetric eXperiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilient divertor features connected to open chaotic edge structures in the Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) are investigated. For the first time, an expanded vessel wall was considered that would give space for implementation of a physical divertor target structure. The analysis was done for four different magnetic configurations with very different chaotic plasma edges. A resilient plasma wall interaction pattern was identified across all configurations. This manifests as qualitatively very similar footprint behavior across the different plasma equilibria. Overall, the resilient field lines of interest with high connection length $L_C$ lie within a helical band along the wall for all configurations. This resiliency can be used to identify the best location of a divertor. The details of the magnetic footprint's resilient helical band is subject to specific field line structures which are linked to the penetration depth of field lines into the plasma and directly influence the heat and particle flux patterns. The differences arising from these details are characterized by introducing a new metric, the minimum radial connection $\text{min}(\delta_N)$ of a field line from the last closed flux surface. The relationship, namely the deviation from a scaling law, between $\text{min}(\delta_N)$ and $L_C$ of the field lines in the plasma edge field line behavior suggests that the field lines are associated with structures such as resonant islands, cantori, and turnstiles. This helps determine the relevant magnetic flux channels based on the radial location of these chaotic edge structures and the divertor target footprint. These details will need to be taken into account for resilient divertor design.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of electron velocity distribution function and Gibbs entropy from electron cyclotron emission in magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for reconstructing the fluctuation components of the electron velocity distribution function f(v_perp), and the electron entropy, which is a functional of f(v_perp) expressed as -f(v_perp)lnf(v_perp)dv_perp, using the harmonic spectrum from pure X-mode electron cyclotron emission (ECE) in optically thin plasmas. Here, v_perp represents the electron velocity perpendicular to the background magnetic field. This formulation employs the maximum entropy method in velocity space using the Hankel transform, which converts from v_perp space to p space (where p is the index of the wavenumber in velocity space). Numerical tests validated the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is applicable across a wide range of magnetized plasma conditions, including conditions with both non-relativistic and relativistic electrons, except in cases of harmonic overlap or under optically thick conditions. Notably, this method does not require radiometer calibration for ECE measurements. This method fascilitates the experimental evaluation of electron entropy transport in fusion plasma experiments. Moreover, when combined with measurements in k-space (spatial distribution), this approach enables entropy distribution acquisition in phase space (k-p space).</description>

      <title>New axisymmetric equilibria with flow from an expansion about the generalized Solov'ev solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct analytic solutions to the generalized Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation, adopting the general linearizing ansatz for the free-function terms it contains, by expanding the genaralized Solov'ev solution [Ch. Simintzis, G. N. Throumoulopoulos, G. Pantis and H. Tasso, Phys. Plasmas 8, 2641 (2001)]. On the basis of these solutions, we examine how the genaralized Solov'ev configuration is modified as the values of the free parameters associated with the additional pressure, poloidal-current and electric-field terms are changed. Thus, a variety of equilibria of tokamak, spherical tokamak and spheromak pertinence are constructed including D-shaped configurations with positive and negative triangularity and diverted configurations with either a couple of X-points or a single X-point.</description>

      <title>Structure of weakly collisional shock waves of multicomponent plasmas inside hohlraums of indirect inertial confinement fusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In laser-driven indirect inertial confinement fusion (ICF), a hohlraum--a cavity constructed from high-Z materials--serves the purpose of converting laser energy into thermal x-ray energy. This process involves the interaction of low-density ablated plasmas, which can give rise to weakly collisional shock waves characterized by a Knudsen number $K_n$ on the order of 1. The Knudsen number serves as a metric for assessing the relative importance of collisional interactions. Preliminary experimental investigations and computational simulations have demonstrated that the kinetic effects associated with weakly collisional shock waves significantly impact the efficiency of the implosion process. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the physics underlying weakly collisional shock waves is essential. This research aims to explore the formation and fundamental structural properties of weakly collisional shock waves within a hohlraum, as well as the phenomena of ion mixing and ion separation in multicomponent plasmas. Weakly collisional shocks occupy a transition regime between collisional shock waves ($K_n \ll 1$) and collisionless shock waves ($K_n \gg 1$), thereby exhibiting both kinetic effects and hydrodynamic behavior. These shock waves are primarily governed by an electrostatic field, which facilitates significant electrostatic sheath acceleration and ion reflection acceleration. The differentiation of ions occurs due to the varying charge-to-mass ratios of different ion species in the presence of electrostatic field, resulting in the separation of ion densities, velocities, temperatures and concentrations. The presence of weakly collisional shock waves within the hohlraum is expected to affect the transition of laser energy and the overall efficiency of the implosion process.</description>

      <title>Harris Dispersion Relation and Bernstein Modes in Dense Magnetized Quantum Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bernstein wave is a well-known electrostatic eigen-mode in magnetized plasmas, and it is of broad connection to multiple disciplines, such as controlled nuclear fusions and astrophysics. In this work, we extend the Bernstein mode from classical to quantum plasmas by means of the quantum kinetic theory in a self-consistent manner, and especially the quantum version of the Harris dispersion relation is derived. The studied quantum effects appear in the form of pseudo-differential operators (\textgreek{Y}DO) in the formula, which are exactly solved using numerical methods. Furthermore, by utilizing the magnetized equilibrium Wigner function, Landau quantization and finite temperature effects are rigorously contained. It is found that behaviours of the quantum Bernstein wave departure significantly from its classical counterpart, especially when $\hbar\omega_{\mathrm{c}}$ is of the same order of the Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>A numerical study of self-focusing and guiding of laser pulse of duration shorter than plasma wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-focusing and guiding of ultra-short (pulse duration: L&lt;lambda_P: plasma wavelength), intense laser pulses in underdense plasma relevant to laser wakefield electron acceleration has been studied numerically. The analysis considers contribution of wakefield non-linearities along with relativistic effects. Stable propagation of laser pulse with mild periodic oscillations upto few Rayleigh lengths were observed. Parametric optimization of the different laser and plasma parameters performed show that, laser pulse as short as L/lambda_P~0.42 is most stably guided upto few Rayleigh lengths for normalized laser intensity, a0~0.9. Next effect of upward density ramps were also studied and it was found that inclusion of an upward density ramp not only enhances self-focusing and guiding of the ultra-short laser pulse but also reduces required minimum laser intensity compared to uniform density profile.</description>

      <title>Plasma acceleration of polarized particle beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-polarized particle beams are of interest for applications like deep-inelastic scattering, e.g. to gain further understanding of the proton's nuclear structure. With the advent of high-intensity laser facilities, laser-plasma-based accelerators offer a promising alternative to common radiofrequency-based accelerators, as they can shorten the required acceleration length significantly. However, in the scope of spin-polarized particles, they bring unique challenges. This paper reviews the developments in the field of spin-polarized particles on the basis of the interaction of laser pulses and high-energy particle beams with plasma. The relevant scaling laws for spin-dependent effects in laser-plasma interaction, as well as acceleration schemes for polarized leptons, ions and gamma quanta are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bulk Motions in the Black Hole Jet Sheath as a Candidate for the Comptonizing Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of two-dimensional general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of the sheath separating the black hole jet from the surrounding medium. We find that the electromagnetic power flowing through the jet sheath is comparable to the overall accretion power, and is an important site of energy dissipation as revealed by the copious appearance of reconnection layers and plasmoid chains: $\sim20\%$ of the radially flowing electromagnetic power is found to be dissipated between 2 and 10 $R_{\rm g}$. The plasma in these dissipation regions moves along a nearly paraboloidal surface with trans-relativistic bulk motions dominated by the radial component, whose dimensionless 4-velocity is $\sim1.2\pm0.5$. In the frame moving with the mean (radially-dependent) velocity, the distribution of stochastic bulk motions resembles a Maxwellian with an `effective bulk temperature' of $\sim$100 keV. Scaling the global simulation to Cygnus X-1 parameters gives a rough estimate of the Thomson optical depth across the jet sheath $\sim0.01-0.1$, and it may increase in future magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent radiative losses. These properties suggest that the dissipative jet sheath may be a viable `coronal' region, capable of upscattering seed thermal X-ray photons ($\sim$1 keV) into a hard, nonthermal tail, as seen during the hard states of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection and plasma transport in the presence of plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equations of the advection-diffusion form underlie both magnetic field and plasma transport. Solutions are exponentially sensitive to small diffusive terms when the advection velocity is chaotic as natural flows generally are. An exact mathematical relation allows Faraday's law to be written in the form of an advection-diffusion equation, but the fundamental importance of chaos to magnetic reconnection is not widely appreciated. In a universe with three spatial coordinates, magnetic reconnection should be and is ubiquitous in evolving magnetic fields. Magnetic fields that depend on only two spatial coordinates are an exception for then a chaotic advective velocity requires an exponential increase in the magnetic field energy. The early focus on two-dimensional models of reconnection led to theories that ignore not only chaos, but also magnetic helicity conservation and non-dissipative magnetic energy transfer. All three are essential concepts for understanding magnetic reconnection, especially when the plasma is turbulent. A full theory of magnetic reconnection in turbulent plasmas is not the intent of this paper. Its intent is develop equations and concepts that are required to develop theories of reconnection and clarify the relation between the physics of magnetic field and plasma transport.</description>

      <title>On the linearity and stability of electrostatic structures based on the Schamel equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contributes in the first part to the correct understanding of the linear limit in the Schamel equation (S-equation) from the perspective of structure formation in collisionless plasmas. The corresponding modes near equilibrium turn out to be nonlinear modes of the underlying microscopic Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system for which particle trapping is responsible. A simple shift of the electrostatic potential to a new pedestal leads to non-negativity and thus mitigates the positivity problem of the S-equation. The stability of a solitary electron hole (bright soliton), based on both the S-equation and an earlier transverse but limited VP instability analysis, exhibits marginal stability and linear perturbations in the form of the asymmetric shift eigenmode of a solvable Schr\"odinger problem. This finding of a dominant shift mode perturbation also seems to have been observed in a numerical PIC simulation, thus providing some confirmation for both theories.</description>
