      <title>TeraRIS NOMA-MIMO Communications for 6G and Beyond Industrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a joint framework that integrates reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with Terahertz (THz) communications and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance smart industrial communications. The proposed system leverages the advantages of RIS and THz bands to improve spectral efficiency, coverage, and reliability key requirements for industrial automation and real-time communications in future 6G networks and beyond. Within this framework, two power allocation strategies are investigated: the first optimally distributes power between near and far industrial nodes, and the second prioritizes network demands to enhance system performance further. A performance evaluation is conducted to compare the sum rate and outage probability against a fixed power allocation scheme. Our scheme achieves up to a 23% sum rate gain over fixed PA at 30 dBm. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the RIS-assisted NOMA MIMO framework for THz enabled industrial communications.</description>

      <title>Modular Design and Experimental Evaluation of 5G Mobile Cell Architectures Based on Overlay and Integrated Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept, architectural design, and performance evaluation of a 5G Mobile Cell (MC) used to provide 5G wireless connectivity to User Equipment (UE) in areas with limited fixed 5G infrastructures or subject to adverse radio conditions. We consider two main approaches to MC design: an overlay model, where the MC obtains backhaul connectivity from a 5G overlay network, and an Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB)-based model, discussing their protocol stacks and architectural implications. In order to validate the MC's performance, we employ an emulation-based testbed using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) implementation, considering different MC positions. The results validate the MC concept and demonstrate that MC positioning significantly influences network performance. This paper has the potential to aid network operators and service providers in selecting and deploying MC architectures for temporary coverage extension and capacity reinforcement in different environments, including seaports, industrial scenarios, and public safety.</description>

      <title>A Design for an Early Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of quantum information technology, quantum networks have become essential for supporting diverse applications, which often have stringent demands for key metrics such as fidelity and request completion time. In this work, we propose a design for early-stage quantum networks that is compatible with the three existing quantum repeater technologies. The design aims to maximize the ability of the network to accommodate the diverse needs of quantum applications, even under conditions of limited quantum resources and suboptimal network performance. We have also described the required identifiers in the quantum network and the specific process for implementing quantum requests. To assess the feasibility of our design, we conduct simulations based on discrete-event modeling of quantum networks. The simulations consider various types of noise and imperfect parameters that might exist in early-stage networks. We analyze the impact of these parameters on the fidelity of the generated entangled states and the request completion time. Furthermore, we investigated additional decisions that the central controller can make beyond path selection, such as the choice of cutoff time and the allocation of network resources to requests.</description>

      <title>Performance Comparison of HTTP/3 and HTTP/2 with Proxy Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper systematically evaluates the performance of QUIC/HTTP3 (H3) and TCP/HTTP2 (H2) in proxy-enhanced environments. H3 integrates UDP-based flow-controlled streams, built-in TLS, multiplexing, and connection migration to better support modern web communication. While prior studies show that H3 can outperform or underperform H2 depending on network conditions, the role of proxies and connection migration remains underexplored. We assess a variety of H2 and H3 client implementations across, particularly in lossy networks and proxy setups. Our findings show that proxies can significantly enhance H2 performance, yielding a 90% improvement in single-stream downloads under severe impairments when used with the BBR congestion control algorithm. In contrast, proxies have minimal impact on H3, which maintains consistent performance due to its internal mechanisms. H3 excels under high-loss and high-latency conditions, leveraging connection migration and multiplexing to deliver up to 88.36% improvement in migration scenarios and 81.5% in extreme loss cases. While optimized H2 can match H3 in some settings, H3 is more robust overall, showing less sensitivity to proxies, impairments, and congestion control variations.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Performance Analysis of Non-Primary Channel Access in Wi-Fi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to improve our understanding of the performance of the Non-Primary Channel Access (NPCA) mechanism, a new feature introduced in IEEE 802.11bn to enhance spectrum utilization in Wi-Fi networks. NPCA enables devices to contend for and transmit on the secondary channel when the primary channel is occupied by transmissions from an Overlapping Basic Service Set (OBSS). We develop a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model that captures the interactions among OBSSs in dense Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) environments when NPCA is enabled, incorporating new NPCA-specific states and transitions. In addition to the analytical insights offered by the model, we conduct numerical evaluations and simulations to quantify NPCA's impact on throughput and channel access delay across various scenarios. Our results show that NPCA can significantly improve throughput and reduce access delays in favorable conditions for BSSs that support the mechanism. Moreover, NPCA helps mitigate the OBSS performance anomaly, where low-rate OBSS transmissions degrade network performance for all nearby devices. However, we also observe trade-offs: NPCA may increase contention on secondary channels, potentially reducing transmission opportunities for BSSs operating there. Overall, the proposed modeling approach offers a foundation for analyzing, optimizing, and guiding the development of NPCA in next-generation Wi-Fi networks.</description>

      <title>HSM and TPM Failures in Cloud: A Real-World Taxonomy and Emerging Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As cloud infrastructure becomes the backbone of modern organizations, the security of cryptographic key management, especially using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), faces unprecedented challenges. While these hardware-based solutions offer strong protection in isolated environments, their effectiveness is being undermined by cloud-native threats such as misconfigurations, compromised APIs, and lateral privilege escalations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of publicly disclosed attacks and breaches involving HSMs and TPMs in cloud environments, identifying recurring architectural and operational flaws. We propose a taxonomy of attack vectors based on real-world case studies and threat intelligence reports, highlighting the gaps between hardware trust anchors and dynamic cloud ecosystems. Furthermore, we evaluate emerging defensive paradigms: confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management systems (dKMS), assessing their potential to address these gaps. Our findings emphasize that securing cloud-based cryptographic trust requires a layered, context-aware approach that integrates both hardware and software safeguards. The study serves as a practical framework for cloud architects and security engineers to reassess key protection strategies in light of evolving threats. To our knowledge, this is the first work to synthesize documented, real-world cloud HSM and TPM failures into a coherent taxonomy grounded in modern threat models.</description>
