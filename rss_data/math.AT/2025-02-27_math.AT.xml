      <title>Generalized Grassmann invariant-redrawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is my old unpublished paper called "The generalized Grassmann invariant". It shows how "pictures" also known as "Peiffer diagrams" represent elements of $H_3G$ for any group $G$ and shows that $K_3(\mathbb Z [G])$ is isomorphic to a group of deformation classes of pictures for the Steinberg group of $\mathbb Z[G]$. A picture representing an element of order $16$ in $K_3(\mathbb Z)\cong \mathbb Z_{48}$ is also constructed. In this updated version of the paper, we modify only the pictures and leave the text more or less unchanged.
  We also added an Appendix to explain the new pictures using representations of quivers and root systems of type $A_n$. Often, some roots are missing in the Morse pictures. We give two ideas to replace these roots. One uses "ghost handle slides" to obtain a standard picture. The second idea uses the (real) Cartan subalgebra $H$ to obtain a "relative" picture for a torsion class and adds "ghost modules" which are directly related to the generalized Grassmann invariant.
  Additions and changes are in blue except the pictures are black with colored ghosts.</description>

      <title>Computing Connection Matrix and Persistence Efficiently from a Morse Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morse decompositions partition the flows in a vector field into equivalent structures. Given such a decomposition, one can define a further summary of its flow structure by what is called a connection matrix.These matrices, a generalization of Morse boundary operators from classical Morse theory, capture the connections made by the flows among the critical structures - such as attractors, repellers, and orbits - in a vector field. Recently, in the context of combinatorial dynamics, an efficient persistence-like algorithm to compute connection matrices has been proposed in~\cite{DLMS24}. We show that, actually, the classical persistence algorithm with exhaustive reduction retrieves connection matrices, both simplifying the algorithm of~\cite{DLMS24} and bringing the theory of persistence closer to combinatorial dynamical systems. We supplement this main result with an observation: the concept of persistence as defined for scalar fields naturally adapts to Morse decompositions whose Morse sets are filtered with a Lyapunov function. We conclude by presenting preliminary experimental results.</description>

      <title>A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</description>

      <title>A straightening-unstraightening equivalence for $\infty$-operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a straightening-unstraightening adjunction for $\infty$-operads in Lurie's formalism, and show it establishes an equivalence between the $\infty$-category of operadic left fibrations over an $\infty$-operad $\mathcal{O}^\otimes$ and the $\infty$-category of $\mathcal{O}^\otimes$-algebras in spaces. In order to do so, we prove that the Hinich-Moerdijk comparison functors induce an equivalence between the $\infty$-categories of operadic left fibrations and dendroidal left fibrations over an $\infty$-operad, and we characterize, for any symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}^\otimes$, the essential image of the monoidal unstraightening functor restricted to strong monoidal functors $\mathcal{C}^\otimes\to \mathcal{S}^\times$.</description>

      <title>The plus construction with respect to subrings of the rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of universal $H \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$-acyclic spaces $\mathcal M$, for any subset $J$ of the prime numbers. The corresponding nullification functors provide thus plus construction functors for ordinary homology with $\mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$ coefficients. Motivated by classical results about Quillen's plus construction for integral homology, we prove that the $H \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$-acyclization functor and the $\mathcal M$-cellularization functor coincide. We show that the acyclization-plus construction fiber sequence is always a cofiber sequence for simply connected spaces, but almost never so when the plus construction is not simply connected, unlike in the classical case.</description>

      <title>On a Hodge locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11405v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are many instances such that deformation space of the homology class of an algebraic cycle as a Hodge cycle is larger than its deformation space as algebraic cycle. This phenomena can occur for algebraic cycles inside hypersurfaces, however, we are only able to gather evidences for it by computer experiments. In this article we describe one example of this for cubic hypersurfaces. The verification of the mentioned phenomena in this case is proposed as the first GADEPs problem. The main goal is either to verify the (variational) Hodge conjecture in such a case or gather evidences that it might produce a counterexample to the Hodge conjecture.</description>
