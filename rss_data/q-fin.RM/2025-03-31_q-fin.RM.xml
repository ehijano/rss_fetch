      <title>Pool Value Replication (CPM) and Impermanent Loss Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analytically characterizes impermanent loss for automated market makers (AMMs) in decentralized markets such as Uniswap or Balancer (CPMM). We derive a static replication formula for the pool's value using a combination of European calls and puts. Furthermore, we establish a result guaranteeing hedging coverage for all final prices within a predefined interval. These theoretical results motivate a numerical example where we illustrate the strangle strategy using real cryptocurrency options data from Deribit, one of the most liquid markets available.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the effect of risk sharing and diversification for infinite mean risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basic principle of any version of insurance is the paradigm that exchanging risk by sharing it in a pool is beneficial for the participants. In case of independent risks with a finite mean this is the case for risk averse decision makers. The situation may be very different in case of infinite mean models. In that case it is known that risk sharing may have a negative effect, which is sometimes called the nondiversification trap. This phenomenon is well known for infinite mean stable distributions. In a series of recent papers similar results for infinite mean Pareto and Fr\'echet distributions have been obtained. We further investigate this property by showing that many of these results can be obtained as special cases of a simple result demonstrating that this holds for any distribution that is more skewed than a Cauchy distribution. We also relate this to the situation of deadly catastrophic risks, where we assume a positive probability for an infinite value. That case gives a very simple intuition why this phenomenon can occur for such catastrophic risks. We also mention several open problems and conjectures in this context.</description>
