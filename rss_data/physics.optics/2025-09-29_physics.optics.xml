      <title>Hyperbolic fractional-order Fourier transformations in scalar theory of diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define hyperbolic fractional-order Fourier transformations by replacing the circular trigonometric functions in the integral expressions of conventional fractional-order Fourier transformations with hyperbolic trigonometric functions. We establish the composition laws of these hyperbolic transformations. We then use hyperbolic fractional-order Fourier transforms to mathematically represent Fresnel diffraction phenomena that cannot be described by conventional fractional Fourier transforms, due to their geometric configurations. Additionally, we apply appropriate compositions of these transformations to coherent optical imaging.</description>

      <title>Snapshot Synthetic Aperture Imaging with Boiling Speckle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-based synthetic aperture (SA) imaging methods, such as Fourier Ptychography, have brought breakthrough high-resolution wide-field-of-view imaging capabilities to microscopy. While these technologies promise similar improvements in long-range imaging applications, macroscale light-based SA imaging is significantly more challenging. In this work, we first demonstrate that speckle noise is particularly problematic for light-based SA systems. Specifically, we prove that it is fundamentally impossible to perform SA imaging of fully diffuse scenes if one captures sequential measurements that suffer from per-measurement-independent speckle. We then develop a snapshot SA imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy that can overcome this limitation and enable SA imaging. Remarkably, we further demonstrate, in simulation, that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures. That is, one can use speckle to improve the resolution of an SA imaging system.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Sensitive Au-TiO2 Nanopillars for Tailored Photocatalytic Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic metasurfaces play a crucial role in resonance-driven photocatalytic reactions by effectively enhancing reactivity via localized surface plasmon resonances. Catalytic activity can be selectively modulated by tuning the strength of plasmonic resonances through two primary non-thermal mechanisms: near-field enhancement and hot carrier injection, which govern the population of energetic carrier excited or injected into unoccupied molecular orbitals. We developed a set of polarization-sensitive metasurfaces consisting of elliptical Au-TiO2 nanopillars, specifically designed to plasmonically modulate the reactivity of a model reaction: the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy reveals a polarization-dependent reaction yield in real-time, modulating from 4.7 (transverse electric polarization) to 9.98 (transverse magnetic polarization) in 10 s period, as quantified by the integrated area of the 480 cm-1 Raman peak and correlated with enhanced absorption at 633 nm. The single metasurface configuration enables continuous tuning of photocatalytic reactivity via active control of plasmonic resonance strength, as evidenced by the positive correlation between measured absorption and product yield. This dynamic approach provides a route to selectively enhance or suppress resonance-driven reactions, which can be further leveraged to achieve selectivity in multibranch reactions, guiding product yields toward desired outcomes.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Speckle-polarization Fiber-optic Sensing for Localized and High-bandwidth Vibration Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-bandwidth and multi-point acoustic and vibration sensing is a critical asset for real-time condition monitoring, maintenance, and surveillance applications. In the case of large scales and harsh environments, optical fiber distributed sensing has emerged as a compelling alternative to electronic transducers, featuring lower installation and maintenance costs, along with compact footprints and enhanced robustness. Yet, current distributed fiber-optic sensing solutions are typically costly and face a resolution-bandwidth tradeoff. In this work, we present an alternative fiber-optic vibration sensing strategy that harnesses a multimodal architecture combining speckle and polarization interrogation. The experimental results demonstrate the concept by achieving speckle-based signal source localization with centimeter-range spatial resolution, while obtaining a high-fidelity waveform reconstruction over at least 100 Hz-40 kHz bandwidth via the polarimetric sensing part. Overall, the work establishes a general and promising blueprint to harness multimodality in fiber sensing and break single-modality constraints.</description>

      <title>Event-based Speckle Interrogation for High-Bandwidth Multi-point Optical Fiber Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speckle-based fiber optic sensors are well-known to offer high sensitivity but are strongly limited on the interrogation side by low camera frame rates and dynamic range. To address this limitation, we present a novel interrogation framework that explores event-based vision to achieve high throughput, high bandwidth, and low-latency speckle analysis of a multimode optical fiber sensor. In addition, leveraging a tensor-based decomposition of the raw event streams through multi-point calibration and machine-learning optimization, our approach also proves capable of isolating simultaneous deformations applied at distinct points. The experimental results validate the methodology by separating the signals of four piezoelectric actuators over a 400Hz-20kHz range with minimal crosstalk applied over varying distances from 3cm to 75cm. Finally, extending the impact of the work with an acoustic sensing proof-of-concept, we have coupled the fiber to two plastic enclosures and recovered separable audio signals between 400 and 1.8 kHz with minimal waveform distortion. Overall, these results establish event-driven speckle interrogation as a new versatile platform for real-time, multi-point acoustic sensing and pave for its application in complex and unstructured environments in future works.</description>

      <title>50 mm $\times$ 50 mm Cesium Atomic Vapor Cell for Terahertz Imaging: Implementation and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors offer transformative potential for high-speed, high-sensitivity terahertz (THz) imaging. However, previous systems are hindered by restricted imaging areas, largely due to the compact dimension of atomic vapor cells and inefficient beam-shaping methodologies. We present a THz imaging system with a 50 mm $\times$ 50 mm area, enabled by a custom-engineered scaled-up atomic vapor cell and an optimized beam-shaping optical architecture. Experimental validation confirms that this system achieves near-diffraction-limited, high resolution THz imaging at 0.55 THz under ambient conditions. Furthermore, its capabilities are demonstrated through real-time visualization of the diffusion dynamics of a deionized water droplet in anhydrous ethanol. This work not only expands the boundaries of Rydberg atomic sensors but also establishes a critical foundation for advancing THz imaging technologies toward into real-world, large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Resolving Complex Subwavelength Grating Structures Using Topologically Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been seen recently that when probing a nanoscale object to determine, for example, size or position via light scattering, significant advantage in measurement precision can be gained from exploiting phase singularities in a topologically structured incident light field. Here, we demonstrate that this advantage, derived from the dependence of scattered intensity profiles on strong local (subwavelength-scale) intensity and phase variations in the incident field, can be extended towards imaging applications: Analysis of scattering patterns from arbitrary binary gratings under superoscillatory illumination successfully resolves feature sizes down to ~{\lambda}/7 in single-shot measurements (a factor of 1.4x smaller than is achieved with plane wave illumination), and ~{\lambda}/10.5 in positionally-displaced multi-shot measurements (which yields no improvement in the plane wave case). Interestingly, there are circumstances in which more complex objects are better resolved than simple structures, because interference effects increase the information content of their scattering patterns.</description>

      <title>Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors with Enhanced Sensitivity for High-Precision Multi-Parameter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, exhibit singular spectral responses with extreme sensitivity to external perturbations, offering new opportunities for precision sensing. In this work, we investigate the sensing performance of Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) engineered to operate near EPs through precise structural tuning. By aligning the reflection spectrum edges with the EP condition, significant sensitivity enhancement is achieved under a power interrogation scheme. The optimized sensors demonstrate sensitivities of $\sim$9.3 dBm/ $^{\circ}$C for temperature and 0.5 dBm/$\mu\epsilon$ for axial strain, representing nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement over conventional FBG sensors. To address cross-sensitivity between temperature and strains, a sensitivity matrix-based approach is implemented, enabling accurate simultaneous detection of multiple perturbations. These results establish EP-engineered FBGs as a highly effective and versatile platform for high-precision, multi-parameter sensing, with broad applicability in telecommunications, structural health monitoring, aerospace systems, and environmental diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-scale noise-resistant on-chip spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performant on-chip spectrometers are important for advancing sensing technologies, from environmental monitoring to biomedical diagnostics. As device footprints approach the scale of the operating wavelength, previously strategies, including those relying on multiple scattering in diffusive media, face fundamental accuracy constraints tied to limited optical path lengths. Here, we demonstrate a wavelength-scale, CMOS-compatible on-chip spectrometer that overcomes this challenge by exploiting inverse-designed quasinormal modes in a complex photonic resonator. These modes extend the effective optical path length beyond the physical device dimensions, producing highly de-correlated spectral responses. We show that this strategy is theoretically optimal for minimizing spectral reconstruction error in the presence of measurement noise. The fabricated spectrometer occupies a lateral footprint of only 3.5 times the free-space operating wavelength, with a spectral resolution of 10 nm across the 3.59-3.76 micrometer mid-infrared band, which is suitable for molecular sensing. The design of this miniaturized noise-resistant spectrometer is readily extensible to other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, paving the way for lab-on-a-chip devices, chemical sensors, and other applications.</description>

      <title>DXRD, a user-friendly suite of two- and multiple-beam dynamical X-ray diffraction programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DXRD program suite consisting of a series of dynamical-theory programs is introduced for computing dynamical X-ray diffraction from single crystals. Its interactive graphic user interfaces (GUIs) allow general users to make complicated calculations with minimal effort. It can calculate plane-wave Darwin curves of single crystals (or multiple crystals) for both the Bragg and Laue cases, including grazing-incidence diffraction and backward diffraction (with Bragg angles approaching 90 degrees). It is also capable of simulating rocking curves for divergent incident X-ray beams with finite bandwidths. A unique capability of DXRD is that it provides, for the first time, a convenient GUI-based multiple-beam diffraction program that can accurately compute arbitrary N-beam diffraction of any geometry using a universal 4Nx4N matrix method. DXRD also provides a mapping program for plotting the entire multiple-beam diffraction lines (monochromator glitches) in the azimuth-energy coordinate system. All these functions make DXRD a convenient and powerful software tool for designing crystal-based synchrotron/X-ray optics (monochromators, analyzers, polarizers, phase plates, etc) and for crystal characterization, X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction teaching.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21583v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Generation of directed electron beams by tight focusing of an ultrashort IR laser in a near-critical plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of accelerating electrons to MeV energies in ambient air using tightly focused laser configurations. In this article, we explore possible strategies to control and optimize the resulting electron beams using laser and gas parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that in near-critical plasmas, linearly and circularly polarized pulses are more efficient than radially polarized pulses for electron acceleration. In addition, electron beams obtained from linearly polarized pulses have lower divergence angles. By studying the efficiency of the acceleration process - characterized by the maximum kinetic energy of electrons and their total number - we identify optimal conditions in ambient air at wavelength lambda_0 approximately 1.5 micrometers and a_0 &gt;= 15. We also scale our results to lower-density air and demonstrate that some noble gases (Ne, Ar) are suitable media for accelerating electrons. Our investigations show that this acceleration scheme enables multi-MeV electrons with low divergence using millijoule-class high-repetition rate lasers, making it a promising candidate for applications in medical sciences and ultrafast imaging.</description>

      <title>Resolving features and derivatives in data with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A frequently occurring challenge in experimental and numerical observation is how to resolve features, such as spectral peaks - with center, width, height - and derivatives from measured data with unavoidable noise. Therefore, we develop a modified Whittaker-Henderson smoothing procedure that balances the spectral features and the noise. In our procedure, we introduce adjustable weights that are optimized using cross-validation. When the measurement errors are known, a straightforward error analysis of the smoothed results is feasible. As an example, we calculate the optical group delay dispersion of a Bragg reflector from synthetic phase data with noise to illustrate the effectiveness of the smoothing algorithm. The smoother faithfully reconstructs the group delay dispersion, allowing to observe details that otherwise remain buried in noise. To further illustrate the power of our smoother, we study several commonly occurring difficulties in data and data analysis and show how to properly smoothen unequally sampled data, how to obtain discontinuities, including discontinuous derivatives or kinks, and how to properly smooth data in the vicinity of boundaries to the domains.</description>

      <title>Tunable Transmissive Metagratings Using Single Layer Cylindrical Plasma Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel single-layer reconfigurable transmissive metagrating based on plasma discharges. Each unit-cell consists of two side-by-side core-shell cylinders, with a tunable plasma core and a high-index dielectric shell. The structure is modeled using a free-electron plasma permittivity with adjustable plasma frequency. Analytical and numerical results show that the main transmission lobe can be switched between -41{\deg}, 0{\deg} and 41{\deg} by tuning the plasma frequencies. Transmission efficiency remains above 80% at broadside and 90% in the steered direction. This tunability enables effective directional control with low reflection and high overall power efficiency.</description>

      <title>Hybrid SU(1,1) interferometry in optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-degenerate SU(1,1) interferometers, beam splitters are replaced by two-mode squeezers, enabling sub-shot-noise sensitivity without input squeezing and robustness to detection losses by quantum entanglement. We propose a hybrid implementation in optomechanics where one "arm" is a mechanical mode undergoing two consecutive, mode-matched interactions with a traveling optical field (constituting the other arm). Such engineered interactions allow for sub-shot-noise phase detection even in the presence of mechanical thermal noise and optical losses, advancing precision interferometry in hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Photons do not see entanglement (Entanglement, nonlocality, and the collapse of the wavefunction)</title>

Abstract: The idea behind entanglement is counterintuitive to any classical viewpoint of physical realism. An entangled state is a nonlocal superposition of realities that belong to a physical system. The common test of such a state has been done through Bell measurements. In this work, we attempt to look at this notion from a different perspective. We study the evolution of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement in inertia reference frames under a Lorentz boost. We consider two specific motions for the observers of the entanglement. First, we consider observers with zero relative motion (Zero-RM). Second, we choose to have a non-zero relative motion (Non-Zero RM) for them. In the second case, we distinguish between observer's perspective of the amplitude probability from the perspective of rest (Non-Zero RM1) and moving (Non-Zero RM2) observers. As a result, the transition probability amplitudes are altered. We observe that entanglement undergoes significant changes and is not preserved maximally from the viewpoint of the stationary observers at the rest frame and asymptotically approaches a minimum close to the light cone (LC). However, from the viewpoint of moving observer in the Non-Zero RM2, entanglement will not survive, and the final state is separable. This is an extremely important observation since the concept of entanglement is supposed to be non-local, and therefore free from any spacetime transformation. Our results demonstrated through the entanglement metrics such as entanglement entropy and purity show that an entangled state is not non-local and hence the so-called collapse of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics does not occur spontaneously in spacetime. Ironically, even entanglement is influenced by motion. Finally, based on this study, one can predict that photons do not carry OAM fundamentally and this property is only emergent at the light-matter interaction limit.</description>

      <title>Tunable optical lattices for the creation of matter-wave lattice solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental techniques that employ an optical accordion lattice with dynamically tunable spacing to create and study bright matter-wave solitons in optical lattices. The system allows precise control of lattice parameters over a wide range of lattice spacings and depths. We detail calibration methods for the lattice parameters that are adjusted to the varying lattice spacing, and we demonstrate site-resolved atom number preparation via microwave addressing. Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.</description>

      <title>Constructing qubit edge states by inverse-designing the electromagnetic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on advances in topological photonics and computational optimization, we inversedesign a periodic dielectric structure surrounding a chain of interacting qubits, emulating an extended, dimerized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) excitonic model. Our approach enables precise control over photon-mediated interactions, allowing us to explore the emergence of topological edge states in the qubit chain. By systematically tuning structural parameters to address both coherent evolution and dissipative effects, we demonstrate that edge states remain robust and isolated from the bulk, even in the presence of long-range coupling and disorder, and preserving key topological properties despite deviations from complete chiral symmetry preservation. This work highlights the potential of inverse design in stabilizing topological excitonic states, opening new possibilities for advanced quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>How to image single isolated atoms by using coherent low-energy electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent low-energy electrons have been demonstrated as a practical tool for imaging individual macromolecules and two-dimensional (2D) crystals. Low-energy electrons exhibit unique properties: low radiation damage to biological molecules and high sensitivity to the local potentials. In this study, we outline the conditions at which single isolated charge-free atoms can be imaged by low-energy electron holography. A single atom produces an interference pattern consisting of concentric fringes of finite diameter and of very weak intensity. The diffraction angle theta, determined as the first minimum of the concentric rings interference pattern, exhibits similar dependency on the source-to-sample distance zs as sin(theta) ~ 0.3/sqrt(zs) for electrons of different energies (50, 100 and 200 eV) and scattered off different elements (Li, C, and Cs). The results are compared to the recently reported experimental holograms of alkali atoms intercalated into bilayer graphene and adsorbed on top of graphene.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission decay and excitation in photonic time crystals</title>

Abstract: Over the last few decades, the predominant strategies for controlling spontaneous emission have involved tailoring the spatial surroundings of quantum emitters or atoms to create resonant or spatially periodic photonic structures. However, the rise of time-varying photonics has prompted a reevaluation of spontaneous emission in dynamically changing environments, especially within photonic time crystals, where optical properties undergo time-periodic modulation. Here, we apply classical light-matter interaction theory together with Floquet analysis to reveal a substantial enhancement of the spontaneous emission decay rate at the momentum gap frequency in photonic time crystals. Moreover, our findings suggest that photonic time crystals enable a nonequilibrium light-matter interaction process: the spontaneous excitation of an atom from its ground state to an excited state, accompanied by the concurrent emission of a photon, referred to as spontaneous emission excitation.</description>

      <title>Coupled Dipole Oscillation Enabled Scintillation Compensation in Turbulence-Impacted Laser Beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work develops a rigorous framework for collective dipole oscillations in dense dielectric media by extending the Lorentz oscillator model to include both quadratic (second order) and cubic (third order) nonlinear restoring forces. Dipole-dipole interactions are incorporated via the dyadic Greens function, leading to a nonlocal description of the medium. Starting from the generalised oscillator equation, the system is expressed in matrix form with an effective stiffness matrix. Using a harmonic steady state ansatz, nonlinear terms are approximated in the frequency domain. Diagonalisation provides collective normal modes, which serve as a basis for perturbative expansion zeroth order captures the linear response, while higher orders describe nonlinear corrections. The polarisation is expressed through corrected mode amplitudes, yielding an effective nonlinear nonlocal susceptibility kernel. Finally, the scalar Greens function formalism is applied to derive the structured output field. These approaches bridge microscopic dipole dynamics with macroscopic optical propagation, offering key insights into nonlinear light matter interaction and turbulence influenced field evolution.</description>

      <title>Transfer-Function Approach to Substrate-Enhanced Diffraction Tomography</title>

Abstract: Forward and backward scattering provide complementary volumetric and interfacial information, yet conventional three-dimensional (3D) imaging typically accesses only one. In this Letter, we present a substrate-enhanced diffraction tomography approach that simultaneously recovers both channels under multi-angle epi-illumination.This geometry captures one forward- and two backward-scattering bands in axially symmetric Fourier regions, where their complementary coverage enables phase-absorption separation in a non-Hermitian spectrum. Explicit 3D transfer functions are derived for both channels, and an axial Kramers-Kronig relation is established to incorporate substrate-induced boundary conditions in a unified framework. Our results establish a label-free, high-resolution 3D imaging modality that surpasses the limits of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Finding passive, reciprocal metasurfaces for arbitrary wave transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a general design method for finding the passive, reciprocal surface impedance tensor required to enact any wave transformation. We do this through characterising the surface in terms of a tensorial surface impedance, showing that a large family of impedance distributions can be found that perform an identical wave transformation. Even when the conditions of reciprocity and passivity are imposed, there still remain many solutions to the design problem.} We exploit this as a design method for metasurfaces, giving two examples where the metasurface rotates the input polarization and reshapes the output field, showing we can parameterize the set of equivalent reciprocal metasurfaces in terms of a single complex parameter. \hl{In addition, through allowing dissipation and gain within the response, the surface can have many different functionalities in the orthogonal polarization, opening up a new route for the design of multiplexed metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Laughlin-like states of few atomic excitations in small subwavelength atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. For example, the combination of $V$-type level structure and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, making the neutral atomic excitations behave like charged particles in a magnetic field. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems (and arrays in general) focuses on the single-excitation regime. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the harmful divergences near the light cone can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.</description>
