      <title>Gradient-free optimization via integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel, general purpose, algorithm to optimize functions $l\colon \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ not assumed to be convex or differentiable or even continuous. The main idea is to sequentially fit a sequence of parametric probability densities, possessing a concentration property, to $l$ using a Bayesian update followed by a reprojection back onto the chosen parametric sequence. Remarkably, with the sequence chosen to be from the exponential family, reprojection essentially boils down to the computation of expectations. Our algorithm therefore lends itself to Monte Carlo approximation, ranging from plain to Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods.
  The algorithm is therefore particularly simple to implement and we illustrate performance on a challenging Machine Learning classification problem. Our methodology naturally extends to the scenario where only noisy measurements of $l$ are available and retains ease of implementation and performance. At a theoretical level we establish, in a fairly general scenario, that our framework can be viewed as implicitly implementing a time inhomogeneous gradient descent algorithm on a sequence of smoothed approximations of $l$. This opens the door to establishing convergence of the algorithm and provide theoretical guarantees. Along the way, we establish new results for inhomogeneous gradient descent algorithms of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Inversion Modeling of Gas Emissions: A Gradient-Based MCMC Estimation of Gaussian Plume Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to global concerns regarding air quality and the environmental impact of greenhouse gas emissions, detecting and quantifying sources of emissions has become critical. To understand this impact and target mitigations effectively, methods for accurate quantification of greenhouse gas emissions are required. In this paper, we focus on the inversion of concentration measurements to estimate source location and emission rate. In practice, such methods often rely on atmospheric stability class-based Gaussian plume dispersion models. However, incorrectly identifying the atmospheric stability class can lead to significant bias in estimates of source characteristics. We present a robust approach that reduces this bias by jointly estimating the horizontal and vertical dispersion parameters of the Gaussian plume model, together with source location and emission rate, atmospheric background concentration, and sensor measurement error variance. Uncertainty in parameter estimation is quantified through probabilistic inversion using gradient-based MCMC methods. A simulation study is performed to assess the inversion methodology. We then focus on inference for the published Chilbolton dataset which contains controlled methane releases and demonstrates the practical benefits of estimating dispersion parameters in source inversion problems.</description>
