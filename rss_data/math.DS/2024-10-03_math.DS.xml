      <title>On the Linear Complexity Associated with a Family of Multidimentional Continued Fraction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complexity of S-adic sequences corresponding to a family of 216 multi-dimensional continued fractions maps, called Triangle Partition maps (TRIP maps), with an emphasis on those with low upper bounds on complexity. Our main result is to prove that the complexity of S-adic sequences corresponding the triangle map (called the (e,e,e)-TRIP map in this paper) has upper bound at most 3n. Our second main result is to prove an upper bound of 2n+1 on complexity for another TRIP map. We discuss a dynamical phenomenon, which we call ``hidden $R^2$ behavior,'' that occurs in this map and its relationship to complexity. Combining this with previously known results and a list of counter-examples, we provide a complete list of the TRIP maps which have upper bounds on complexity of at most 3n, except for one remaining case for which we conjecture such an upper bound to hold.</description>

      <title>Continuity of Lyapunov exponents for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For non-autonomous linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs), we establish that the top Lyapunov exponent is continuous if the coefficients "almost" uniformly converge. For autonomous SDEs, assuming the existence of invariant measures and the convergence of coefficients and their derivatives in pointwise sense, we get the continuity of all Lyapunov exponents. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for autonomous SDEs with strict monotonicity condition, all Lyapunov exponents are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the coefficients under the $L^{p,p}$ norm ($p&gt;2$). Similarly, the H\"older continuity of Lyapunov exponents holds under weaker regularity conditions. It seems that the continuity of Lyapunov exponents has not been studied for SDEs so far, in spite that there are many results in this direction for discrete-time dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Innovative Dynamics: Utilizing Perelman's Entropy and Ricci Flow for Settler Position Models on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel approach to modeling the positional dynamics of stars using discrete dynamical systems. We define star evolution through discrete-time update rules based on right ascension, declination, and distance, incorporating chaotic behavior via nonlinear functions and external perturbations. By applying Ricci flow and Riemannian metrics, we provide new insights into the positional dynamics of stars. Theoretical computations of Perelman entropy are used to assess system complexity, with high-precision Runge-Kutta methods ensuring accurate solutions for our chaotic model. We quantify chaos using Lyapunov exponents and perform bifurcation analysis to study how parameter variations affect the dynamics. Comparing our model to the Lorenz attractor reveals both similarities and unique characteristics in stellar dynamics. Our results show that entropy increases exponentially, indicating that predicting star positions with precision becomes increasingly challenging over time. This study advances the understanding of chaos in celestial systems and contributes to dynamical systems theory by integrating chaos theory with astronomical modeling.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in the family of billiards associated with the curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe some dynamical properties of one parameter families of billiards on convex curves (ovals) which are deformed by the curvature (curve-shortening) flow. We obtain the bifurcations of the period two orbits and some special non-Birkhoff orbits, the normal periodic orbits. We prove the destruction of non-convex caustics of the ellipse by deforming it through the curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic snaking of contact defects in reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply spatial dynamical-systems techniques to prove that certain spatiotemporal patterns in reversible reaction-diffusion equations undergo snaking bifurcations. That is, in a narrow region of parameter space, countably many branches of patterned states coexist that connect at towers of saddle-node bifurcations. Our patterns of interest are contact defects, which are 1-dimensional time-periodic patterns with a spatially oscillating core region that at large distances from the origin in space resemble pure temporally oscillatory states and arise as natural analogues of spiral and target waves in one spatial dimension. We show that these solutions lie on snaking branches that have a more complex structure than has been seen in other contexts. In particular, we predict the existence of families of asymmetric travelling defect solutions with arbitrary background phase offsets, in addition to symmetric standing target and spiral patterns. We prove the presence of these additional patterns by reconciling results in classic ODE studies with results from the spatial-dynamics study of patterns in PDEs and using geometrical information contained in the stable and unstable manifolds of the background wavetrains and their natural equivariance structure.</description>

      <title>Weak Generative Sampler to Efficiently Sample Invariant Distribution of Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling invariant distributions from an Ito diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in both biased and correlated samples. Current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from the base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for mini-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Distinct from conventional generative models, our method neither necessitates the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centres selected from the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension and attracting laminations for fully irreducible automorphisms of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a classic theorem of Birman and Series about the set of complete simple geodesics on a hyperbolic surface, we study the Hausdorff dimension of the set of endpoints in $\partial F_r$ of some abstract algebraic laminations associated with free group automorphisms. For a fully irreducible $\phi\in\Out(F_r)$ we show that the set of endpoints $\mathcal E_{L_\phi}\subseteq \partial F_r$ of the attracting lamination $L_\phi$ of $\phi$ has Hausdorff dimension $0$ for any tree $T\in\cvr$ and any visual metric on the boundary $\partial T=\partial F_r$. If $\phi$ is both atoroidal and fully irreducible, we deduce the same conclusion for the set of endpoints of the ending lamination $\Lambda_\phi$ of $\phi$ that gets collapsed by the Cannon-Thurston map $\partial F_r\to \partial G_\phi$ for the associated free-by-cyclic group $G_\phi=F_r\rtimes_\phi\mathbb Z$.</description>

      <title>Global dynamical structures from infinitesimal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering mechanisms underlying the behaviors of complex, high dimensional, and nonlinear dynamical systems is a central goal of the natural and synthetic sciences. Breakthroughs in machine learning in concert with increasing capacities for computation and data collection have enabled the use of trajectory measurements for learning predictive models. However, rigorous approaches for interpreting mechanisms from such models remain elusive, and asymptotic prediction accuracy suffers if the model does not capture important state space structures (e.g., attracting invariant sets). These limitations are especially pressing for system-level behaviors such as whole-body locomotion, where discontinuous, transient, and multiscale phenomena are common and prior models are rare. To take the next step towards a theory and practice for dynamical inference of complex multiscale systems in biology and beyond, we introduce VERT, a framework for learning the attracting sets that characterize global system behavior without recourse to learning a global model. Our approach is based on an infinitesimal-local-global (ILG) framework for estimating the proximity of any sampled state to the attracting set, if one exists, with formal accuracy guarantees. We demonstrate our approach on phenomenological and physical oscillators with hierarchical and impulsive dynamics, finding sensitivity to both global and intermediate attractors composed in sequence and parallel. Application of VERT to human running kinematics data reveals insight into control modules that stabilize task-level dynamics, supporting a longstanding neuromechanical control hypothesis. The VERT framework thus enables rigorous inference of underlying dynamical structure even for systems where learning a global dynamics model is impractical or impossible.</description>

      <title>Deep Koopman-layered Model with Universal Property Based on Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose deep Koopman-layered models with learnable parameters in the form of Toeplitz matrices for analyzing the dynamics of time-series data. The proposed model has both theoretical solidness and flexibility. By virtue of the universal property of Toeplitz matrices and the reproducing property underlined in the model, we can show its universality and the generalization property. In addition, the flexibility of the proposed model enables the model to fit time-series data coming from nonautonomous dynamical systems. When training the model, we apply Krylov subspace methods for efficient computations. In addition, the proposed model can be regarded as a neural ODE-based model. In this sense, the proposed model establishes a new connection among Koopman operators, neural ODEs, and numerical linear algebraic methods.</description>

      <title>Subexponential growth and $C^1$ actions on one-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group with no finitely generated subgroup of exponential growth. We show that every action of $G$ on a countable set preserving a linear (respectively, circular) order can be realised as the restriction of some action by $C^1$ diffeomorphisms on an interval (respectively, the circle) to an invariant subset. As a consequence, every action of $G$ by homeomorphisms on a compact connected one-manifold can be made $C^1$ upon passing to a semi-conjugate action. The proof is based on a functional characterisation of groups of local subexponential growth.</description>

      <title>Ion-Acoustic Wave Dynamics in a Two-Fluid Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma is a medium containing free electrons and cations, where each particle group behaves as a conducting fluid with a single velocity and temperature in the presence of electromagnetic fields. The difference in roles electrons and ions play define the two-fluid description of plasma. This paper examines ion-acoustic waves generated by the particles in both hot and cold plasma using a collisionless "Euler-Poisson" (EP) system. Employing phase-space asymptotic analysis, we establish that for specific wave speeds, EP acquires homoclinic orbits at the steady-state equilibrium and consequently, traveling waves. Combining python and Wolfram Mathematica, we captured visualizations of such behavior in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Fast-moving pattern interfaces close to a Turing instability in an asymptotic model for the three-dimensional B\'enard-Marangoni problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation of planar patterns and fast-moving pattern interfaces in an asymptotic long-wave model for the three-dimensional B\'enard-Marangoni problem, which is close to a Turing instability. We derive the model from the full free-boundary B\'enard-Marangoni problem for a thin liquid film on a heated substrate of low thermal conductivity via a lubrication approximation. This yields a quasilinear, fully coupled, mixed-order degenerate-parabolic system for the film height and temperature. As the Marangoni number $M$ increases beyond a critical value $M^*$, the pure conduction state destabilises via a Turing(-Hopf) instability. Close to this critical value, we formally derive a system of amplitude equations which govern the slow modulation dynamics of square or hexagonal patterns. Using center manifold theory, we then study the bifurcation of square and hexagonal planar patterns. Finally, we construct planar fast-moving modulating travelling front solutions that model the transition between two planar patterns. The proof uses a spatial dynamics formulation and a center manifold reduction to a finite-dimensional invariant manifold, where modulating fronts appear as heteroclinic orbits. These modulating fronts facilitate a possible mechanism for pattern formation, as previously observed in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following Beck-Chen, we say a flow $\phi_t$ on a metric space $(X, d)$ is superdense if there is a $c &gt; 0$ such that for every $x \in X$, and every $T&gt;0$, the trajectory $\{\phi_t x\}_{0 \le t \le cT}$ is $1/T$-dense in $X$. We show that a linear flow on a translation surface is superdense if the associated Teichm\"uller geodesic is bounded. Conversely, if the linear flow is superdense, we show that along the Teichm\"uller geodesic, the diameter of the surface remains bounded. This generalizes work of Beck-Chen on lattice surfaces, and is reminiscent of work of Masur on unique ergodicity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate some properties of the clopen type semigroup of an action of a countable group on a compact, $0$-dimensional, Hausdorff space X. We discuss some characterizations of dynamical comparison (most of which were already known in the metrizable case) in this setting; and prove that for a Cantor minimal action $\alpha$ of an amenable group the topological full group of $\alpha$ admits a dense, locally finite subgroup iff the corresponding clopen type semigroup is unperforated. We also discuss some properties of clopen type semigroups of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactifications and universal minimal flows of countable groups, and derive some consequences on generic properties in the space of minimal actions of a given countable group on the Cantor space.</description>

      <title>Weakly asymptotically quasiperiodic solutions for time-dependent Hamiltonians with a view to celestial mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the planar three-body problem perturbed by a celestial body modeled as a time-dependent perturbation that decays in time. We assume that the motion of the celestial body is given and is unbounded with a non-zero asymptotic velocity. We prove the existence of orbits converging in time to some motions that are ``close'' to the quasiperiodic solutions associated with the Hamiltonian of the planar three-body problem.
  The proof relies on an abstract theorem that contains a substantial portion of the mathematical complexities presented in this work. This theorem is flexible and can be applied to many other physical phenomena. It considers Hamiltonian vector fields that are the sum of two components. The first possesses quasiperiodic solutions, and the second decays polynomially fast as time tends to infinity. We prove the existence of orbits converging in time to some motions that are ``close'' to the quasiperiodic solutions associated with the unperturbed system.
  It generalizes a previous work where a stronger polynomial decay in time was considered, and solutions converging in time to the quasiperiodic orbits associated with the unperturbed system were proved.
  In the abstract theorem contained in the present paper, the too-weak decay in time of the perturbation strongly modifies the dynamic at infinity. This serious difficulty requires a deep modification of the proof. This new strategy relies on the application of a Nash-Moser implicit function theorem (the previous result was proved with the fixed point theorem) and the introduction of weak solutions (in this case, the orbits do not converge to the quasiperiodic solutions associated with the unperturbed system).</description>

      <title>Saddle avoidance of noise-induced transitions in multiscale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multistable dynamical systems driven by weak Gaussian noise, transitions between competing states are often assumed to pass via a saddle on the separating basin boundary. By contrast, we show that timescale separation can cause saddle avoidance in non-gradient systems. Using toy models from neuroscience and ecology, we study cases where sample transitions deviate strongly from the instanton predicted by Freidlin-Wentzell theory, even for weak finite noise. We attribute this to a flat quasipotential and present an approach based on the Onsager-Machlup action to aptly predict transition paths.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we show that the $N$-center problem with rational weak and moderate forces is not rationally integrable for all but a finite number of values $\alpha\in(0,2)\cap \mathbb{Q}$, where $\alpha$ is the order of the singularities. We identify the remaining cases and provide the necessary conditions for their integrability.</description>

      <title>Continuous dependence for McKean-Vlasov SDEs under distribution-dependent Lyapunov conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the continuous dependence on initial values and parameters of solutions as well as invariant measures for McKean-Vlasov SDEs under distribution-dependent Lyapunov conditions. In contrast to the classical SDEs, the solutions for McKean-Vlasov SDEs do not converge in probability although the initial values converge in probability, which is due to the mismatch of the distances between measures. Finally, we give some examples to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed spectral approximation of Koopman operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Koopman operators and transfer operators represent nonlinear dynamics in state space through its induced action on linear spaces of observables and measures, respectively. This framework enables the use of linear operator theory for supervised and unsupervised learning of nonlinear dynamical systems, and has received considerable interest in recent years. Here, we propose a data-driven technique for spectral approximation of Koopman operators of continuous-time, measure-preserving ergodic systems that is asymptotically consistent and makes direct use of known equations of motion (physics). Our approach is based on a bounded transformation of the Koopman generator (an operator implementing directional derivatives of observables along the dynamical flow), followed by smoothing by a Markov semigroup of kernel integral operators. This results in a skew-adjoint, compact operator whose eigendecomposition is expressible as a variational generalized eigenvalue problem. We develop Galerkin methods to solve this eigenvalue problem and study their asymptotic consistency in the large-data limit. A key aspect of these methods is that they are physics-informed, in the sense of making direct use of dynamical vector field information through automatic differentiation of kernel functions. Solutions of the eigenvalue problem reconstruct evolution operators that preserve unitarity of the underlying Koopman group while spectrally converging to it in a suitable limit. In addition, the computed eigenfunctions have representatives in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, enabling out-of-sample evaluation of learned dynamical features. Numerical experiments performed with this method on integrable and chaotic low-dimensional systems demonstrate its efficacy in extracting dynamically coherent observables under complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Streaming Compression of Scientific Data via weak-SINDy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper a streaming weak-SINDy algorithm is developed specifically for compressing streaming scientific data. The production of scientific data, either via simulation or experiments, is undergoing an stage of exponential growth, which makes data compression important and often necessary for storing and utilizing large scientific data sets. As opposed to classical "offline" compression algorithms that perform compression on a readily available data set, streaming compression algorithms compress data "online" while the data generated from simulation or experiments is still flowing through the system. This feature makes streaming compression algorithms well-suited for scientific data compression, where storing the full data set offline is often infeasible. This work proposes a new streaming compression algorithm, streaming weak-SINDy, which takes advantage of the underlying data characteristics during compression. The streaming weak-SINDy algorithm constructs feature matrices and target vectors in the online stage via a streaming integration method in a memory efficient manner. The feature matrices and target vectors are then used in the offline stage to build a model through a regression process that aims to recover equations that govern the evolution of the data. For compressing high-dimensional streaming data, we adopt a streaming proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) process to reduce the data dimension and then use the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to compress the temporal data of the POD expansion. We propose modifications to the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to accommodate the dynamically updated POD basis. By combining the built model from the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm and a small amount of data samples, the full data flow could be reconstructed accurately at a low memory cost, as shown in the numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Regret-Optimal Federated Transfer Learning for Kernel Regression with Applications in American Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an optimal iterative scheme for federated transfer learning, where a central planner has access to datasets ${\cal D}_1,\dots,{\cal D}_N$ for the same learning model $f_{\theta}$. Our objective is to minimize the cumulative deviation of the generated parameters $\{\theta_i(t)\}_{t=0}^T$ across all $T$ iterations from the specialized parameters $\theta^\star_{1},\ldots,\theta^\star_N$ obtained for each dataset, while respecting the loss function for the model $f_{\theta(T)}$ produced by the algorithm upon halting. We only allow for continual communication between each of the specialized models (nodes/agents) and the central planner (server), at each iteration (round). For the case where the model $f_{\theta}$ is a finite-rank kernel regression, we derive explicit updates for the regret-optimal algorithm. By leveraging symmetries within the regret-optimal algorithm, we further develop a nearly regret-optimal heuristic that runs with $\mathcal{O}(Np^2)$ fewer elementary operations, where $p$ is the dimension of the parameter space. Additionally, we investigate the adversarial robustness of the regret-optimal algorithm showing that an adversary which perturbs $q$ training pairs by at-most $\varepsilon&gt;0$, across all training sets, cannot reduce the regret-optimal algorithm's regret by more than $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon q \bar{N}^{1/2})$, where $\bar{N}$ is the aggregate number of training pairs. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical experiments in the context of American option pricing, utilizing a randomly generated finite-rank kernel.</description>

      <title>McDuff and Prime von Neumann algebras arising from Thompson-Like Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the cloning system construction of Skipper and Zaremsky [SZ21], under sufficient conditions, gives rise to Thompson-Like groups which are stable; in particular, these are McDuff groups in the sense of Deprez and Vaes [DV18]. This answers a question of Bashwinger and Zaremsky posed in [BZ23] in the affirmative. In the opposite direction, we show that the group von Neumann algebra for the Higman-Thompson groups $T_d$ and $V_d$ are both prime II$_1$ factors. This follows from a new deformation/rigidity argument for a certain class of groups which admit a proper cocycle into a quasi-regular representation that is not necessarily weakly $\ell^2$.</description>

      <title>Absolute concentration robustness: Algebra and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of how biological systems maintain homeostasis in changing environments, Shinar and Feinberg introduced in 2010 the concept of absolute concentration robustness (ACR). A biochemical system exhibits ACR in some species if the steady-state value of that species does not depend on initial conditions. Thus, a system with ACR can maintain a constant level of one species even as the environment changes. Despite a great deal of interest in ACR in recent years, the following basic question remains open: How can we determine quickly whether a given biochemical system has ACR? Although various approaches to this problem have been proposed, we show that they are incomplete. Accordingly, we present new methods for deciding ACR, which harness computational algebra. We illustrate our results on several biochemical signaling networks.</description>

      <title>Opinion response functions are key to understanding tipping of social conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extent to which committed minorities can overturn social conventions is an active area of research in the mathematical modelling of opinion dynamics. Researchers generally use simulations of agent-based models (ABMs) to compute approximate values for the minimum committed minority size needed to overturn a social convention. In this manuscript, we expand on previous work by studying an ABM's mean-field behaviour using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and a new tool, opinion response functions. Using these methods allows for formal analysis of the deterministic model which can provide a theoretical explanation for observed behaviours, e.g., coexistence or overturning of opinions. In particular, opinion response functions are a method of characterizing the equilibria in our social model. Our analysis confirms earlier numerical results and supplements them with a precise formula for computing the minimum committed minority size required to overturn a social convention.</description>
