      <title>Randomized Controlled Trials for Security Copilot for IT Administrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As generative AI (GAI) tools become increasingly integrated into workplace environments, it is essential to measure their impact on productivity across specific domains. This study evaluates the effects of Microsoft's Security Copilot ("Copilot") on information technology administrators ("IT admins") through randomized controlled trials. Participants were divided into treatment and control groups, with the former granted access to Copilot within Microsoft's Entra and Intune admin centers. Across three IT admin scenarios - sign-in troubleshooting, device policy management, and device troubleshooting - Copilot users demonstrated substantial improvements in both accuracy and speed. Across all scenarios and tasks, Copilot subjects experienced a 34.53% improvement in overall accuracy and a 29.79% reduction in task completion time. We also find that the productivity benefits vary by task type, with more complex tasks showing greater improvement. In free response tasks, Copilot users identified 146.07% more relevant facts and reduced task completion time by 61.14%. Subject satisfaction with Copilot was high, with participants reporting reduced effort and a strong preference for using the tool in future tasks. These findings suggest that GAI tools like Copilot can significantly enhance the productivity and efficiency of IT admins, especially in scenarios requiring information synthesis and complex decision-making.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion And The Minimum Price Markov Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Minimum Price Markov Game (MPMG), a theoretical model that reasonably approximates real-world first-price markets following the minimum price rule, such as public auctions. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a framework to study market fairness and regulation in both digitized and non-digitized public procurement processes, amid growing concerns about algorithmic collusion in online markets. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning-driven artificial agents, we demonstrate that (i) the MPMG is a reliable model for first-price market dynamics, (ii) the minimum price rule is generally resilient to non-engineered tacit coordination among rational actors, and (iii) when tacit coordination occurs, it relies heavily on self-reinforcing trends. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate about algorithmic pricing and its implications.</description>
