      <title>Effects of Satellite Body on Magnetic Plasma Orbit Control for Nanosatellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic plasma orbit control (MPOC) has been proposed for micro and nanosatellites in the sun-synchronous orbits (SSO) in the low earth orbit (LEO). This method utilizes the plasma drag force generated by the interaction between space plasma and the magnetic field surrounding magnetic torquers (MTQs). In this study, the effects of a finite satellite body on high-potential area generation are investigated by using a plasma flow simulation based on the fully kinetic model. The simulation results show that the predicted high-potential region shrinks due to the finite satellite body because the positive charges of stagnated ions in front of the satellite are absorbed into the satellite surface. In addition, simply applying a bias voltage at the front surface is ineffective in expanding the high-potential region. Specifically, applying a positive bias at the front surface resulted in the accumulation of electrons within the satellite enclosure, causing the floating potential of the satellite to drop according to the applied voltage.</description>

      <title>Effective theory for stochastic particle acceleration, with application to magnetized turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of particle acceleration in turbulent plasmas is a topic of broad interest, which is making rapid progress thanks to dedicated, large-scale numerical experiments. The first part of this paper presents an effective theory of stochastic Fermi acceleration, which subsumes all forms of non-resonant acceleration in ideal electric fields and is applicable in generic settings. It combines an exact equation connecting the energization rate to the statistics of the velocity field with a statistical model of particle transport through the structures (i.e., the regions of strong velocity gradients). In a second part, this formalism is applied to MHD turbulence to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the scale-by-scale contributions to the advection and diffusion coefficients. Acceleration is found to be maximal on scales where particles can be trapped inside structures for an eddy turn-around timescale, or in intense structures associated with sharp bends of the magnetic field lines in large-amplitude turbulence (as reported earlier). These fast acceleration regimes, which are inhomogeneous in space, pave the way for a rich phenomenology. We discuss the scalings obtained, their interpretation and show that the findings compare satisfactorily with existing numerical results.</description>

      <title>Plasma dynamics in thin domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we study the geometric structures of the Rotating Shallow Water Magnetohydrodynamics (RSW-MHD) equations through a Lie group invariant Euler-Poincar\'e variational principle. In this geometric framework, we derive new, structure-preserving stochastic RSW-MHD models by introducing stochastic perturbations to the Lie-Poisson structure of the deterministic RSW-MHD equations. The resulting stochastic RSW-MHD equations provide new capabilities for potential application to uncertainty quantification and data assimilation, for example, in space plasma (space weather) and solar physics, particularly in solar tachocline dynamics.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Structure of Incomplete Carbon-Oxygen Detonations in Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-oxygen (CO) detonation with reactions terminating either after burning of C$^{12}$ in the leading C$^{12}$ + C$^{12}$ reaction or after burning of C$^{12}$ and O$^{16}$ to Si-group elements may occur in the low-density outer layers of exploding white dwarfs and be responsible for the production of intermediate-mass elements observed in the outer layers of Type Ia supernovae. Basic one-dimensional properties of CO-detonations have been summarized in our previous work. This paper presents the results of two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of low-density CO-detonations and discusses their multidimensional stability, cellular structure, and propagation through a constant low-density background. We find three-dimensional CO detonations to be strikingly different from their one-dimensional and two-dimensional counterparts. Three-dimensional detonations are significantly more robust and capable of propagating without decay compared to highly unstable and marginal one- and two- dimensional detonations. The detonation cell size and whether burning of C$^{12}$ in a three-dimensional detonation wave is followed by the subsequent O$^{16}$ burning is sensitive to both the background density and the initial C$^{12}$ to O$^{16}$ mass ratio. We also discuss the possible implications for understanding the observed early time bumps in light-curves.</description>

      <title>Strong geometry dependence of the X-ray Thomson Scattering Spectrum in single crystal silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on results from an experiment at the European XFEL where we measured the x-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) spectrum of single crystal silicon with ultrahigh resolution. Compared to similar previous experiments, we consider a more complex scattering setup, in which the scattering vector changes orientation through the crystal lattice. In doing so, we are able to observe strong geometric dependencies in the inelastic scattering spectrum of silicon at low scattering angles. Furthermore, the high quality of the experimental data allows us to benchmark state-of-the-art TDDFT calculations, and demonstrate TDDFT's ability to accurately predict these geometric dependencies. Finally, we note that this experimental data was collected at a much faster rate than another recently reported dataset using the same setup, demonstrating that ultrahigh resolution XRTS data can be collected in more general experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the feasibility of Ohmically heated negative triangularity tokamak power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative triangularity tokamak plasmas feature naturally enhanced confinement in the so-called L-mode regime, irrespective of the power of external heating. This is in contrast to conventional scenarios, which require exceeding a given heating power threshold to induce a discrete transition to a regime of enhanced confinement called H-mode. H-mode is, however, subject to problematic instabilities and additionally suffers from confinement degradation with increasing external heating. Using simple zero dimensional power balance and standard empirical scaling laws for confinement, we analyze the impact of external heating on several different reactor-relevant devices (i.e. SPARC, MANTA, ITER and DEMO). We compare the nominal externally heated scenarios with corresponding negative triangularity cases without external heating. For devices with sufficiently high magnetic field and/or fusion gain, the internally (Ohmically) heated negative triangularity versions achieve better performance. We conclude that Ohmically heating a negative triangularity power plant is an attractive option meriting further investigation.</description>
