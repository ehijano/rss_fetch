      <title>Short-time large deviations of first-passage functionals for high-order stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider high-order stochastic processes $x(t)$ described by the Langevin equation $\frac{{{d^m}x\left( t \right)}}{{d{t^m}}}= \sqrt{2D} \xi(t)$, where $\xi(t)$ is a delta-correlated Gaussian noise with zero mean, and $D$ is the strength of noise. We focus on the short-time statistics of the first-passage functionals $A=\int_{0}^{T} \left[ x(t)\right] ^n dt$ along the trajectories starting from $x(0)=L$ and terminating whenever passing through the origin for the first-time at $t=T$. Using the optimal fluctuation method, we analytically obtain the most likely realizations of the first-passage processes for a given constraint $A$ with $n=0$ and 1, corresponding to the first-passage time itself and the area swept by the first-passage trajectory, respectively. The tail of the distribution of $A$ shows an essential singularity at $A \to 0$, $P_{m,n}(A |L) \sim \exp\left(-\frac{\alpha_{m,n}L^{2mn-n+2}}{D A^{2m-1}} \right)$, where the explicit expressions for the exponents $\alpha_{m,0}$ and $\alpha_{m,1}$ for arbitrary $m$ are obtained.</description>

      <title>Density of states in neural networks: an in-depth exploration of learning in parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning in neural networks critically hinges on the intricate geometry of the loss landscape associated with a given task. Traditionally, most research has focused on finding specific weight configurations that minimize the loss. In this work, born from the cross-fertilization of machine learning and theoretical soft matter physics, we introduce a novel, computationally efficient approach to examine the weight space across all loss values. Employing the Wang-Landau enhanced sampling algorithm, we explore the neural network density of states - the number of network parameter configurations that produce a given loss value - and analyze how it depends on specific features of the training set. Using both real-world and synthetic data, we quantitatively elucidate the relation between data structure and network density of states across different sizes and depths of binary-state networks.</description>

      <title>Chirality Modulated Accumulation of Chiral Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed motion up a concentration gradient is crucial for the survival and maintenance of numerous biological systems, such as sperms moving towards an egg during fertilization or ciliates moving towards a food source. In these systems, chirality - manifested as a rotational torque - plays a vital role in facilitating directed motion. While systematic studies of active molecules in activity gradients exist, the effect of chirality remains little studied. In this study, we examine the simplest case of a chiral active particle connected to a passive particle in a spatially varying activity field. We demonstrate that this minimal setup can exhibit rich emergent tactic behaviors, with the chiral torque serving as the tuning parameter. Notably, when the chiral torque is sufficiently large, even a small passive particle enables the system to display the desired accumulation behavior. This study provides valuable insights into the design principles of hybrid bio-molecular devices of the future.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Thermodynamic Foundation of the Grand-potential Phase Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choosing the correct free energy functional is critical when developing thermodynamically-consistent phase field models. We show that the grand-potential phase field model minimizes the Helmholtz free energy. While both functionals are at a minimum at equilibrium, the Helmholtz free energy decreases monotonically with time in the grand-potential phase field model, whereas the grand potential does not. Minimizing the grand potential implies a different problem where a system can exchange mass with its surroundings at every point, leading to a condition of iso-chemical-potential and invalidating mass conservation of the system.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the charge transport in tilted chains on the choice of two-body interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tilted chains of spinless fermions in the presence of the nearest-neighbor density-density interaction for which the noninteracting counterpart displays Stark localization. We demonstrate that the latter two-body interaction can be decomposed into two (orthogonal) parts which, respectively, commute and do not commute with the single-particle Hamiltonian. We derive an explicit form of the noncommuting part that decreases with tilt and describes the nearest-neighbor correlated hopping and the pair-hopping interaction. When the density-density coupling is replaced by the pair-hopping interaction of the same magnitude then the charge dynamics may be faster by a few orders of magnitude than in the original model.</description>

      <title>Ab initio machine learning simulation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solutions to the solid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A first principles machine learning model has been developed aimed at studying the formation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. The model, dubbed SCAN-ML, reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semi-empirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, including the carbonate to bicarbonate transformation. Our model thus paves the way for the study of reactive crystallization pathways in calcium carbonate, which are currently poorly understood.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence models trained through loss minimization have demonstrated significant success, grounded in principles from fields like information theory and statistical physics. This work explores these established connections through the lens of statistical mechanics, starting from first-principles sample concentration behaviors that underpin AI and machine learning. Our development of statistical mechanics for modeling highlights the key role of exponential families, and quantities of statistics, physics, and information theory.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscopic reorganization of network communities across different scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide the mathematical argument on the modularity function, the results from the real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process characterized by a local dip in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.</description>

      <title>Thermalization Dynamics in Closed Quantum Many Body Systems: a Precision Large Scale Exact Diagonalization Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a Krylov-subspace time evolution algorithm, we simulate the real-time dynamics of non-integrable finite spin rings to quite long times with high accuracy. We systematically study the finite-size deviation between the resulting equilibrium state and the thermal state, and we highlight the importance of the energy variance on the deviations. We find that the deviations are well described by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and that the von Neumann entropy correction scaling is the square of the local operator scaling. We reveal also an area law contribution to the relaxed von Neumann entropy, which we connect to the mutual information between the considered subsystem and its immediate environment. We also find that local observables relax towards equilibrium exponentially with a relaxation time scale that grows linearly with system length and is somewhat independent of the local operator, but depends strongly on the energy of the initial state, with the fastest relaxation times found towards one end of the overall energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Universal interface fluctuations in the contact process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interface representation of the contact process (CP) at its directed-percolation critical point, where the scaling properties of the interface can be related to those of the original particle model. Interestingly, such a behavior happens to be intrinsically anomalous and more complex than that described by the standard Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling Ansatz of surface kinetic roughening. We expand on a previous numerical study by Dickman and Mu\~noz [Phys. Rev. E 62, 7632 (2000)] to fully characterize the kinetic roughening universality class for interface dimensions $d=1, 2$, and 3. Beyond obtaining scaling exponent values, we characterize the interface fluctuations via their probability density function (PDF) and covariance, seen to display universal properties which are qualitatively similar to those recently assessed for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) and other important universality classes of kinetic roughening. Quantitatively, while for $d=1$ the interface covariance seems to be well described by the KPZ, Airy$_1$ covariance, no such agreement occurs in terms of the fluctuation PDF nor the scaling exponents.</description>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems (NFTs) relate work performed on a system as its Hamiltonian varies with time, to equilibrium data of the initial and final states. In a classical context the system energy can be directly measured, while a quantum implementation requires the incorporation of a work-agent. We demonstrate that the uncertainty principle imposes inherent quantum limitations on the applicability of the NFT for probing non-trivial mesoscopic systems. We work out the NFT validity regime for the simplest quantum-dot toy model, and discuss future applications.</description>

      <title>Motility-Induced Pinning in Flocking System with Discrete Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a motility-induced pinning transition in the active Ising model for a self-propelled particle system with discrete symmetry. This model was known to exhibit a liquid-gas type flocking phase transition, but a recent study reveals that the polar order is metastable due to droplet excitation. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that, for an intermediate alignment interaction strength, the steady state is characterized by traveling local domains, which renders the polar order short-ranged in both space and time. We further demonstrate that interfaces between colliding domains become pinned as the alignment interaction strength increases. A resonating back-and-forth motion of individual self-propelled particles across interfaces is identified as a mechanism for the pinning. We present a numerical phase diagram for the motility-induced pinning transition, and an approximate analytic theory for the growth and shrink dynamics of pinned interfaces. Our results show that pinned interfaces grow to a macroscopic size preventing the polar order in the regime where the particle diffusion rate is sufficiently smaller than the self-propulsion rate. The growth behavior in the opposite regime and its implications on the polar order remain unresolved and require further investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the anisotropic effects on a system of three qubits with chain and ring topology, described by the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg XXX model subjected to a homogeneous magnetic field. We explore the Stirling and Otto cycles and find that easy-axis anisotropy significantly enhances engine efficiency across all cases. At low temperatures, the ring configuration outperforms the chain on both work and efficiency during the Stirling cycle. Additionally, in both topologies, the Stirling cycle achieves Carnot efficiency with finite work at quantum critical points. In contrast, the quasistatic Otto engine also reaches Carnot efficiency at these points but yields no useful work. Notably, the Stirling cycle exhibits all thermal operational regimes engine, refrigerator, heater, and accelerator unlike the quasistatic Otto cycle, which functions only as an engine or refrigerator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic scaling behavior of the Kuramoto model with finite populations has been notably elusive, despite comprehensive investigations employing both analytical and numerical methods. In this paper, we explore the Kuramoto model with ``deterministic'' sampling of natural frequencies, employing extensive numerical simulations and reporting the asymptotic values of the finite-size scaling exponents, which deviate significantly from the previously reported values in the literature. Additionally, we observe that these exponents are sensitive to the specifics of the sampling method. We discuss the origins of this variability through the self-consistent theory of entrained oscillators.</description>

      <title>Improvement of analysis for relaxation of fluctuations by the use of Gaussian process regression and extrapolation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium relaxation (NER) method, which has been used to investigate equilibrium systems via their nonequilibrium behavior, has been widely applied to various models to estimate critical temperatures and critical exponents. Although the estimation of critical temperatures has become more reliable and reproducible, that of critical exponents raises concerns about the method's reliability. Therefore, we propose a more reliable and reproducible approach using Gaussian process regression. In addition, the present approach introduces statistical errors through the bootstrap method by combining them using the extrapolation method. Our estimation for the two-dimensional Ising model yielded $\beta = 0.12504(6)$, $\gamma = 1.7505(10)$, and $\nu = 1.0003(6)$, consistent with the exact values. The value $z = 2.1669(9)$ is reliable because of the high accuracy of these exponents. We also obtained the critical exponents for the three-dimensional Ising model and found that they are close to those reported in a previous study. Thus, for systems undergoing second-order transitions, our approach improves the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of the NER analysis. Because the proposed approach requires the relaxation of some observables from Monte Carlo simulations, its simplicity imparts it with significant potential.</description>

Abstract: The study of thermalization and its breakdown in isolated systems has led to a deeper understanding of non-equilibrium quantum states and their dependence on initial conditions. The role of initial conditions is prominently highlighted by the existence of quantum many-body scars, special athermal states with an underlying effective superspin structure, embedded in an otherwise chaotic many-body spectrum. Spin Heisenberg and $XXZ$ models and their variants in one and higher dimension have been shown to host exact quantum many-body scars, exhibiting perfect revivals of spin helix states that are realizable in synthetic and condensed matter systems. Motivated by these advances, we propose experimentally accessible, local, time-dependent protocols to explore the spatial thermalization profile and highlight how different parts of the system thermalize and affect the fate of the superspin. We identify distinct parametric regimes for the ferromagnetic ($X$-polarized) initial state based on the interplay between the driven spin and the rest, including local athermal behavior where the driven spin effectively decouples, acting like a ``cold" spot while being instrumental in heating up the other spins. We also identify parameter regimes where the superspin remains resilient to local driving for long time scales. We develop a real and Floquet space picture that explains our numerical observations, and make predictions that can be tested in various experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the proposal of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, error and disturbance of quantum measurements have been fundamental notions in quantum physics. As is often the case when defining physical quantities in quantum physics, there is no single way to define these two notions, and many independent definitions of them have been given. Here, we establish a novel formulation defining the error and disturbance as special cases of the irreversibility in quantum processes. The formulation enables us to apply the knowledge of irreversibility in stochastic thermodynamics and quantum information theory to the error and disturbance in quantum measurements. To demonstrate this strength, we provide three byproducts: First, we unify the existing formulations of error and disturbance. Second, we extend the quantitative Wigner--Araki--Yanase theorem -- a universal restriction on measurement implementation under a conservation law -- to errors and disturbances of arbitrary definitions and processes. Third, we reveal that our formulation covers the out-of-time-orderd-correlator -- a measure of quantum chaos in a quantum many-body system -- as the irreversibility in analogy with the measurement context, and provide its experimental evaluation method.</description>

      <title>Look beyond additivity and extensivity of entropy for black hole and cosmological horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the plethora of nonextensive and/or nonadditive entropies which go beyond the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs formulation. After defining the basic notions of additivity, extensivity, and composability, we discuss the properties of these entropies and their mutual relations, if they exist. The results are presented in two informative tables supposedly of strong interest to gravity and cosmology community in the context of intensively explored recent days the horizon entropies for black hole and cosmological models. This is since gravitational systems admit long-range interactions which usually lead to a break of the standard additivity rule for thermodynamical systems composed of subsystems in Boltzmann-Gibbs thermodynamics. The features of additivity, extensivity, and the composability are listed systematically. Some brief discussion on the validity of the notion of equilibrium temperature for nonextensive systems is also presented.</description>

      <title>Flow of supercooled liquids under dipolar force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The viscosity of supercooled liquids notably increases with decreasing temperature, leading to solidification through a glass transition. This process is accompanied by dynamic heterogeneity, characterized by persistent dynamic spatial correlations. This study investigates how dynamic heterogeneity influences the applicability of the Navier-Stokes equations to the flow of supercooled liquids. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, we subjected a two-dimensional supercooled liquid to a localized dipolar force field and compared the resulting steady velocity field with the prediction from the Navier-Stokes equations. Our approach captures a significant breakdown of the Navier-Stokes equations in real space; specifically, supercooled liquids flow more rapidly near the external force than the prediction from the Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore, this deviation is enhanced by the supercooling and is accompanied by the growth of dynamic heterogeneity.</description>
