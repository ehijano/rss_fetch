      <title>The hardcore brokers: Core-periphery structure and political representation in Denmark's corporate elite network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Who represents the corporate elite in democratic governance? Prior studies find a tightly integrated "inner circle" network representing the corporate elite politically across varieties of capitalism, yet they all rely on data from a highly select sample of leaders from only the largest corporations. We cast a wider net. Analyzing new data on all members of corporate boards in the Danish economy (200k directors in 120k boards), we locate 1500 directors that operate as brokers between local corporate networks. We measure their network coreness using k-core detection and find a highly connected core of 275 directors, half of which are affiliated with smaller firms or subsidiaries. Analyses show a strong positive association between director coreness and the likelihood of joining one of the 650 government committees epitomizing Denmark's social-corporatist model of governance (net of firm and director characteristics). The political network premium is largest for directors of smaller firms or subsidiaries, indicating that network coreness is a key driver of business political representation, especially for directors without claims to market power or weight in formal interest organizations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the economic, social and environmental prospects for commercial natural annual grasslands by performing a sensitivity analysis on a multidisciplinary integrated model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated modelling assessment that estimated the sensitivities of five endogenous factors in commercial rangelands, i.e. number of active farmers, profits, stocking rate, standing herbage biomass, and soil erosion, to the same percentage variation in 70 factors, including economic and climate drivers. The assessment utilised a system dynamics model (107 equations) which represents an area of extensive private farms, its farmers, the main local markets on which they trade, and key ecosystem services involved. The assessment procedure consisted in analysing the behaviours of 288,000 variants of this system during 300 years, each under a different economic and climate scenario. Our key findings were as follows: 1) It is likely that at least annual grasslands will suffer environmental degradation in the future, and that such degradation will be primarily caused by climate change, not by the increasing demand for livestock products; 2) Private farming systems provide social and economic security to farmers against the effects of climate change, especially in a scenario of rising prices of animal products. However, this research will remain incomplete until its methods and results can be contrasted with other similar assessments.</description>

      <title>Will artificial intelligence accelerate or delay the race between nuclear energy technology budgeting and net-zero emissions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of nuclear energy technology budgeting and artificial intelligence on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 20 OECD economies. Unlike previous research that relied on conventional panel techniques, we utilize the Method of Moment Quantile Regression panel data estimation techniques. This approach provides quantile-specific insights while addressing issues of endogeneity and heteroscedasticity, resulting in a more nuanced and robust understanding of complex relationships. A novel aspect of this research work is introducing the moderating effect of artificial intelligence on the relationship between nuclear energy and CO2 emissions. The results found that the direct impact of artificial intelligence on CO2 emissions is significant, while the effect of nuclear energy technology budgeting is not. Additionally, artificial intelligence moderates the relationship between nuclear energy technology budgeting and CO2 emissions, aiding nuclear energy in reducing carbon emissions across OECD countries. Our findings indicate that transitioning to a low-carbon future is achievable by replacing fossil fuel energy sources with increased integration of artificial intelligence to promote nuclear energy technologies. This study demonstrates that energy innovations can serve as effective climate-resilience strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change.</description>

      <title>Monetary-Fiscal Interaction and the Liquidity of Government Debt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does the monetary and fiscal policy mix alter households' saving incentives? To answer these questions, we build a heterogenous agents New Keynesian model where three different types of agents can save in assets with different liquidity profiles to insure against idiosyncratic risk. Policy mixes affect saving incentives differently according to their effect on the liquidity premium -- the return difference between less liquid assets and public debt. We derive an intuitive analytical expression linking the liquidity premium with consumption differentials amongst different types of agents. This underscores the presence of a transmission mechanism through which the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy shapes economic stability via its effect on the portfolio choice of private agents. We call it the 'self-insurance demand channel', which moves the liquidity premium in the opposite direction to the standard 'policy-driven supply channel'. Our analysis thus reveals the presence of two competing forces driving the liquidity premium. We show that the relative strength of the two is tightly linked to the policy mix in place and the type of business cycle shock hitting the economy. This implies that to stabilize the economy, monetary policy should consider the impact of the 'self-insurance' on the liquidity premium.</description>

      <title>Towards post-growth policymaking: Barriers and enablers for sustainable wellbeing initiatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing wellbeing for all while safeguarding planetary boundaries may require governments to pursue post-growth policies. Previous empirical studies of sustainable wellbeing initiatives investigating enablers of and barriers to post-growth policymaking are either based on a small number of empirical cases or lack an explicit analytical framework. To better understand how post-growth policymaking could be fostered, we investigate 29 initiatives across governance scales in Europe, New Zealand, and Canada. We apply a framework that distinguishes polity, politics, and policy to analyze the data. We find that the main enablers and barriers relate to the economic growth paradigm, the organization of government, attitudes towards policymaking, political strategies, and policy tools and outcomes. Engaging in positive framings of post-growth visions to change narratives and building broad-based alliances could act as drivers. However, initiatives face a tension between the need to connect to broad audiences and a risk of co-optation by depolitization.</description>

      <title>AI Governance through Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues that market governance mechanisms should be considered a key approach in the governance of artificial intelligence (AI), alongside traditional regulatory frameworks. While current governance approaches have predominantly focused on regulation, we contend that market-based mechanisms offer effective incentives for responsible AI development. We examine four emerging vectors of market governance: insurance, auditing, procurement, and due diligence, demonstrating how these mechanisms can affirm the relationship between AI risk and financial risk while addressing capital allocation inefficiencies. While we do not claim that market forces alone can adequately protect societal interests, we maintain that standardised AI disclosures and market mechanisms can create powerful incentives for safe and responsible AI development. This paper urges regulators, economists, and machine learning researchers to investigate and implement market-based approaches to AI governance.</description>

      <title>Using Event Studies as an Outcome in Causal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a causal framework for applications where the outcome of interest is a unit-specific response to events, which first needs to be measured from the data. We suggest a two-step procedure: first, estimate unit-level event studies (ULES) by comparing pre- and post-event outcomes of each unit to a suitable control group; second, use the ULES in causal analysis. We outline the theoretical conditions under which this two-step procedure produces interpretable results, highlighting the underlying statistical challenges. Our method overcomes the limitations of regression-based approaches prevalent in the empirical literature, allowing for a deeper examination of heterogeneity and dynamic effects. We apply this framework to analyze the impact of childcare provision reform on the magnitude of child penalties in the Netherlands, illustrating its ability to reveal nuanced positive relationships between childcare provision and parental labor supply. In contrast, traditional regression-based analysis delivers negative effects, thereby emphasizing the benefits of our two-step approach.</description>

      <title>Breaking New Ground, Reinforcing Old Gaps: Gender Disparities in Access to Emerging Research Frontiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study exploits COVID-19 as an exogenous shock in biomedical research to show how the emergence of an unexpected new research topic exacerbates gender bias in key authorship positions of scientific publications relevant to new research topics (e.g. Vaccines, Epidemiology). We determine author's gender based on the names listed on their scientific publications and analyze the changes in the composition of the scientific teams after the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a Difference-in-Differences approach, we find that although the share of female authorship has increased overall, women are less likely to be first or last authors (the most prestigious positions) on COVID-19-related research papers and more likely to be found in middle author positions. Stay-at-home mandates, the journal importance and funding opportunities do not fully account for the decline of women in key author positions. The main difference in first authorship is due to the composition of the team and the experience of the lead authors in COVID-19 related research. First authorship by women declined after teams of novices emerged, where lead authors have no prior experience in COVID-related research. Discretionality in first-author appointments for newcomers, combined with high pressure to publish quickly, may have led to discriminatory biases. Conversely, there may also be differences in risk-taking attitudes in doing research in unfamiliar domains. Monitoring gender inequality in scientific production is crucial for reducing gender inequalities and for implementing timely policies that ensure equal access to emerging research topics.</description>
