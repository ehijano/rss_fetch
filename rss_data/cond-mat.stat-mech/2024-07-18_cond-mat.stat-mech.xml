      <title>Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of passive Brownian particles in a fluctuating harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider passive Brownian particles trapped in an "imperfect" harmonic trap. The trap is imperfect because it is randomly turned off and on, and as a result, particles fail to equilibrate. In other words, the harmonic trap is time-dependent due to its strength evolving stochastically in time. Particles in such a system are passive and activity arises through external control of a trapping potential, therefore, no internal energy is used to power particle motion. A stationary Fokker-Planck equation of this system can be represented as a third-order differential equation, and its solution, a stationary distribution, can be found by representing it as a superposition of Gaussian distributions for different strengths of a harmonic trap. The resulting stationary distributions tend to be spread out with an exponential asymptotic tail. A pure Gaussian distribution is recovered only in the limit of a very fast alternating on-and-off cycle. The average potential energy of the system is found to be the same as that for a system in equilibrium, that is, for a system with a time-independent harmonic trap. The entropy production rate, which quantifies the distance from equilibrium, is found to be independent of the rate with which the trap fluctuates.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium phase coexistence in boundary-driven diffusive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid-gas phase coexistence in a boundary-driven diffusive system is studied by analyzing fluctuating hydrodynamics of a density field defined on a one-dimensional lattice with a space interval $\Lambda$. When an interface width $\ell$ is much larger than $\Lambda$, the discrete model becomes the standard fluctuating hydrodynamics, where the phase coexistence condition is given by the local equilibrium thermodynamics. In contrast, when $\ell &lt; \Lambda$, the most probable density profile is determined by a new variational principle, where the chemical potential at the interface is found to deviate from the equilibrium coexistence chemical potential. This means that metastable states at equilibrium stably appear near the interface as the influence of the particle current. The variational function derived in the theoretical analysis is also found to be equivalent to the variational function formulated in an extended framework of thermodynamics called global thermodynamics. Finally, the validity of the theoretical result is confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Improvement of analysis for relaxation of fluctuations by the use of Gaussian process regression and extrapolation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium relaxation (NER) method, which has been used to investigate equilibrium systems via their nonequilibrium behavior, has been widely applied to various models to estimate critical temperatures and critical exponents. Although the estimation of critical temperatures has become more reliable and reproducible, that of critical exponents raises concerns about the method's reliability. Therefore, we propose a more reliable and reproducible approach using Gaussian process regression. In addition, the present approach introduces statistical errors through the bootstrap method by combining them using the extrapolation method. Our estimation for the two-dimensional Ising model yielded $\beta = 0.12504(6)$, $\gamma = 1.7505(10)$, and $\nu = 1.0003(6)$, consistent with the exact values. The value $z = 2.1669(9)$ is reliable because of the high accuracy of these exponents. We also obtained the critical exponents for the three-dimensional Ising model and found that they are close to those reported in a previous study. Thus, for systems undergoing second-order transitions, our approach improves the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of the NER analysis. Because the proposed approach requires the relaxation of some observables from Monte Carlo simulations, its simplicity imparts it with significant potential.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of fast and slow excitons with an exchange in quasi-two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of analytical calculations and numerical simulations we study the diffusion properties in quasi-two-dimensional structures with two exciton subsystems with an exchange between them. The experimental realisation is possible in systems where fast and slow exciton subsystems appear. For substantially different diffusion coefficients of the species the negative diffusion can be observed, if one measures the transport properties of only a single subsystem, just as was obtained in experimental studies for quasi-two-dimensional semiconductor systems. The initial transition from a fast subsystem to a slow one results in a delayed release of fast excitons in the area close to the original excitation spot. Hence, the signal from the fast excitons alone includes the delayed replenishment from the transition of slow quasi-particles. This is seen as the narrowing of the exciton density profile or decrease of mean-squared displacement which is then interpreted as a negative diffusion. The average diffusion coefficients for the combined population are analytically expressed through the diffusion coefficients of fast and slow excitons. Simple analytical expressions for effective diffusion coefficients obtained in limiting cases are of interest both for theoretical and experimental analysis of not only the exciton transport, but also for a variety of systems, where fast and slow moving subsystems are present.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Central Limit Theorem to Critical Systems: Revisiting Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Limit Theorem does not hold for strongly correlated stochastic variables, as is the case for statistical systems close to criticality. Recently, the calculation of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the magnetization mode has been performed with the functional renormalization group in the case of the three-dimensional Ising model [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)]. It has been shown in that article that there exists an entire family of universal PDFs parameterized by $\zeta=\lim_{L,\xi_\infty\rightarrow\infty} L/\xi_\infty$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed perturbatively in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion. We determine the whole family of universal PDFs and show that they are in good qualitative agreement with Monte Carlo data. Finally, we conjecture on how to significantly improve the quantitative agreement between the one-loop and the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</description>

      <title>Competition of long-range interactions and noise at ramped quench dynamical quantum phase transition: The case of the long-range pairing Kitaev chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of long-range pairing Kitaev model with noiseless/noisy linear time dependent chemical potential, is investigated in the frame work of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). We have shown for the ramp crosses a single quantum critical point, while the short-range pairing Kitaev model displays a single critical time scale, the long-range pairing induces a region with three DQPTs time scales. We have found that the region with three DQPTs time scales shrinks in the presence of the noise. In addition, we have uncovered for a quench crossess two critical points, the critical sweep velocity above which the DQPTs disappear, enhances by the long-range pairing exponent while decreases in the presence of the noise. On the basis of numerical simulations, we have shown that noise diminishes the long-range pairing inductions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Energy: Teleporting Current, Charge, and More</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an homage to Quantum Energy Teleportation, we generalize the idea to arbitrary physical observables, not limited to energy, and prove a rigorous upper bound on the activated ("teleported") quantity. The essence of this protocol is a quantum feedback control with respect to the entangled ground state of a quantum many-body system. To demonstrate the concept, we explore a (1+1)-dimensional chiral Dirac system and execute the protocol for the electric current and charge. One of the most significant results is the creation of long-range correlations across the system after applying control operations only to one local site. Consequently but surprisingly, the induced charge susceptibility fully reconstructs the phase diagram, despite the model initially having no charge. Moreover, we find an activation of novel chiral dynamics induced by feedback control operations, which can be experimentally confirmed using trapped ions and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>A statistical mechanics investigation of Unfolded Protein Response across organisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems rely on coordinated molecular interactions, especially those related to gene expression and protein activity. The Unfolded Protein Response is a crucial mechanism in eukaryotic cells, activated when unfolded proteins exceed a critical threshold. It maintains cell homeostasis by enhancing protein folding, initiating quality control, and activating degradation pathways when damage is irreversible. This response functions as a dynamic signaling network, with proteins as nodes and their interactions as edges. We analyze these protein-protein networks across different organisms to understand their intricate intra-cellular interactions and behaviors. In this work, analyzing twelve organisms, we assess how fundamental measures in network theory can individuate seed-proteins and specific pathways across organisms. We employ network robustness to evaluate and compare the strength of the investigated PPI networks, and the structural controllability of complex networks to find and compare the sets of driver nodes necessary to control the overall networks. We find that network measures are related to phylogenetics, and advanced network methods can identify main pathways of significance in the complete Unfolded Protein Response mechanism.</description>

      <title>Exact path-integral representation of the Wright-Fisher model with mutation and selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wright-Fisher model describes a biological population containing a finite number of individuals. In this work we consider a Wright-Fisher model for a randomly mating population, where selection and mutation act at an unlinked locus. The selection acting has a general form, and the locus may have two or more alleles. We determine an exact representation of the time dependent transition probability of such a model in terms of a path integral. Path integrals were introduced in physics and mathematics, and have found numerous applications in different fields, where a probability distribution, or closely related object, is represented as a 'sum' of contributions over all paths or trajectories between two points. Path integrals provide alternative calculational routes to problems, and may be a source of new intuition and suggest new approximations. For the case of two alleles, we relate the exact Wright-Fisher path-integral result to the path-integral form of the transition density under the diffusion approximation. We determine properties of the Wright-Fisher transition probability for multiple alleles. We show how, in the absence of mutation, the Wright-Fisher transition probability incorporates phenomena such as fixation and loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a coarse-graining procedure for quantum cellular automata on hypercubic lattices that consists in grouping neighboring cells into tiles and selecting a subspace within each tile. This is done in such a way that multiple evolution steps applied to this subspace can be viewed as a single evolution step of a new quantum cellular automaton, whose cells are the subspaces themselves. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalizability and use it to investigate the renormalization flow of cellular automata on a line, where the cells are qubits and the tiles are composed of two neighboring cells. The problem is exhaustively solved, and the fixed points of the renormalization flow are highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van-der-Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between Rydberg atoms, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. For repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments on the triangular lattice supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on explicitly calculated pair interactions for ${}^{87}$Rb and with a critical entropy per particle $S/N \approx 0.19$. Such a lattice supersolid is long-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.</description>

Abstract: The site percolation on the triangular lattice stands out as one of the few exactly solved statistical systems. By initially configuring critical percolation clusters of this model and randomly reassigning the color of each percolation cluster, we obtain coarse-grained configurations by merging adjacent clusters that share the same color. It is shown that the process can be infinitely iterated in the infinite-lattice limit, leading to an iterative site percolation model. We conjecture from the self-matching argument that percolation clusters remain fractal for any finite generation, which can even take any positive real number by a generalized process. Extensive simulations are performed, and, from the generation-dependent fractal dimension, a continuous family of previously unknown universalities is revealed.</description>

Abstract: Many physical phenomena are modeled as stochastic searchers looking for targets. In these models, the probability that a searcher finds a particular target, its so-called hitting probability, is often of considerable interest. In this work we determine hitting probabilities for stochastic search processes conditioned on being faster than a random short time. Such times have been used to model stochastic resetting or stochastic inactivation. These results apply to any search process, diffusive or otherwise, whose unconditional short-time behavior can be adequately approximated, which we characterize for broad classes of stochastic search. We illustrate these results in several examples and show that the conditional hitting probabilities depend predominantly on the relative geodesic lengths between the initial position of the searcher and the targets. Finally, we apply these results to a canonical evidence accumulation model for decision making.</description>

      <title>A theorem in relation to quantum Ising models and some exactly solvable models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of the paradigmatic one-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model $H= J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + h \sum_i \sigma^z_i$ is well-known. Instead, let us imagine "applying" the transverse field via a transverse Ising coupling of the spins to partner auxiliary spins, i.e. $H= J_x \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + J_z \sum_i \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{\text{partner of }i}$. If each spin of the chain has a unique auxiliary partner, then the theorem states that the resultant eigenspectrum is still the same as that of the quantum Ising model with $h = J_z$ and the degeneracy of the entire spectrum is $2^{\text{number of auxiliary spins}}$. This follows from the existence of extensively large and mutually anticommuting sets of conserved quantities for $H$. We can interpret this as the auxiliary spins remaining paramagnetic down to zero temperature with an extensive ground state degeneracy. This is lost upon the loss of the unique partner condition for the full spin chain. Other cases where such extensive degeneracy survives or gets lost are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The induced friction on a probe moving in a nonequilibrium medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a powerful combination of projection-operator method and path-space response theory, we derive the fluctuation dynamics of a slow inertial probe coupled to a steady nonequilibrium medium under the assumption of time-scale separation. The nonequilibrium can be realized by external nongradient driving on the medium particles or by their (athermal) active self-propulsion. The resulting friction on the probe is explicit as a time-correlation for medium observables and is decomposed into two terms, one entropic and proportional to the noise amplitude as in the Einstein relation for equilibrium media, and a frenetic term that can take both signs. As illustration, we give the exact expressions for the friction and noise of a probe in a rotating run-and-tumble medium and in a sheared overdamped medium. In both examples, we find an interesting transition to absolute negative probe friction as the nonequilibrium medium exhibits sufficient and persistent rotational current.</description>

      <title>The precursor of the critical transitions in majority vote model with the noise feedback from the vote layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11398v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate phase transitions in the Majority-Vote model coupled with noise layers of different structures. We examine the Square lattice and Random-regular networks, as well as their combinations, for both vote layers and noise layers. Our findings reveal the presence of independent third-order transitions in all cases and dependent third-order transitions when critical transitions occur. This suggests that dependent third-order transitions may serve as precursors to critical transitions in non-equilibrium systems. Furthermore, we observe that when the structure of vote layers is local, the coupling between the vote layer and the noise layer leads to the absence of critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Long-time properties of generic Floquet systems are approximately periodic with the driving period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Floquet quantum system is governed by a Hamiltonian that is periodic in time. Consider the space of piecewise time-independent Floquet systems with (geometrically) local interactions. We prove that for all but a measure zero set of systems in this space, starting from a random product state, many properties (including expectation values of observables and the entanglement entropy of a macroscopically large subsystem) at long times are approximately periodic with the same period as the Hamiltonian. Thus, in almost every Floquet system of arbitrarily large but finite size, discrete time-crystalline behavior does not persist to strictly infinite time.</description>

      <title>Does rare, noise-induced, bypass transition in plane Couette flow bypass instantons ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rare noise induced paths that go all the way from stable laminar to transitional turbulent plane Couette flow and investigate whether these paths share the properties of classical noise induced transitions. The rare paths from laminar to turbulent flow are computed using Adaptive Multilevel Splitting, a rare event simulation method, and are validated against Direct Numerical Simulations at moderately small energy injection rate. The flow is forced outside its natural scales and redistribute energy to the unforced large scales so that the reactive trajectories display forced streamwise velocity tubes at the natural scale of velocity streaks. As the trajectory proceeds, these tubes gradually grow in amplitude until they cross the separatrix between laminar and turbulent flow. Streamwise vortices are visible after velocity tubes have reached near turbulent amplitude. As the domain size is increased from Lx * Lz=6 *4 to 36*24, spatial localisation then extension of the generated coherent streaks and vortices in the spanwise direction is observed. The paths computed in MFU display many of the characteristics of instantons, that often structure noise induced transitions: concentration of trajectories, exponentially increasing waiting times before transition, and Gumbel distribution of trajectory durations. However, bisections started on the reactive trajectories indicate that the trajectory lack two key ingredients of instantons. They do not visit the neighbourhood of the nearest saddle point and do not display the natural relaxation path from that saddle to transitional wall turbulence. The reactive paths do not concentrate more and more around the same trajectory as energy injection rate is decreased, but instead gradually move in phase space. They might reconnect with instantons at very small energy injection rate and exceedingly long waiting times.</description>

      <title>Topological effect on the Anderson transition in chiral symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of an emergent quasi-localized phase in chiral symmetry classes, where wave function along a spatial direction with weak topology is delocalized but exponentially localized along the other directions. The Anderson transition in 2D chiral symmetry classes is induced by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs of a U(1) phase degree of freedom, while the weak topology endows the pair with the Berry phase. We argue that the Berry phase induces spatial polarizations of the pairs along the topological direction through the quantum interference effect, and the proliferation of the polarized vortex pairs results in the quasi-localized phase.</description>

      <title>Robust teleportation of a surface code and cascade of topological quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation is a facet where quantum measurements can act as a powerful resource in quantum physics, as local measurements allow to steer quantum information in a non-local way. While this has long been established for a single Bell pair, the teleportation of a many-qubit entangled state using non-maximally entangled resources presents a fundamentally different challenge. Here we investigate a tangible protocol for teleporting a long-range entangled surface code state using elementary Bell measurements and its stability in the presence of coherent errors that weaken the Bell entanglement. We relate the underlying threshold problem to the physics of anyon condensation under weak measurements and map it to a variant of the Ashkin-Teller model of statistical mechanics with Nishimori type disorder, which gives rise to a cascade of phase transitions. Tuning the angle of the local Bell measurements, we find a continuously varying threshold. Notably, the threshold moves to infinity for the $X+Z$ angle along the self-dual line -- indicating that infinitesimally weak entanglement is sufficient in teleporting a self-dual topological surface code. Our teleportation protocol, which can be readily implemented in dynamically configurable Rydberg atom arrays, thereby gives guidance for a practical demonstration of the power of quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless to BCS-like superconducting transition crossover driven by weak magnetic fields in ultra-thin NbN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in ultra-thin NbN films is investigated in the presence of weak perpendicular magnetic fields. A jump in the phase stiffness at the BKT transition is detected up to 5 G, while the BKT features are smeared between 5 G and 50 G, disappearing altogether at 100 G, where conventional current-voltage behaviour is observed. Our findings demonstrate that weak magnetic fields, insignificant in bulk systems, deeply affect our ultra-thin system, promoting a crossover from Halperin-Nelson fluctuations to a BCS-like state with Ginzburg-Landau fluctuations, as the field increases. This behavior is related to field-induced free vortices that screen the vortex-antivortex interaction and smear the BKT transition.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing thermalization dynamics of non-Hermitian quantum systems via GKSL master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to non-Hermitian quantum systems has become one of the most important topics in dissipative quantum chaos, recently giving rise to intense debates. The process of thermalization is intricate, involving many time-evolution trajectories in the reduced Hilbert space of the system. By considering two different expansion forms of the density matrices adopted in the biorthogonal and right-state time evolutions, we have derived two versions of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equations describing the non-Hermitian systems coupled to a bosonic heat bath in thermal equilibrium. By solving the equations, we have identified a sufficient condition for thermalization under both time evolutions, resulting in Boltzmann biorthogonal and right-eigenstate statistics, respectively. This finding implies that the recently proposed biorthogonal random matrix theory needs an appropriate revision. Moreover, we have exemplified the precise dynamics of thermalization and thermodynamic properties with test models.</description>

      <title>Integrability of open boundary driven quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary. We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.</description>
