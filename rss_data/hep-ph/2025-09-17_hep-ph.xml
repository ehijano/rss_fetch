      <title>Taming the dark photon production via a non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflationary production of massive dark photons with non-minimal couplings to gravity shows surprising growth at large momenta. These couplings appear in the effective low energy description of a more fundamental theory. We find that the growth is absent in explicit gauge invariant UV-complete models. Such completions are also free of "ghost" instabilities, which often appear in the effective models.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of dissipative Dark Matter I: the Born limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the energy-differential cross section and energy loss rate for dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM) models within the Born regime using perturbative quantum field theory. Six dissipative scenarios are considered, incorporating the emission of particles that may be either massless or possess a kinematically allowed light mass. Both short-range and long-range force-mediated dSIDM interactions are examined. In the non-relativistic regime we obtain closed-form expressions of the energy-differential cross sections by a controlled expansion in the initial relative dark matter velocity. Up to trivial factors, the leading-order squared emission amplitude is model-independent for massless emissions. Model dependence arises for massive particle emission and at the next-to-leading order. The latter reduces to three distinct cases. The derived analytical expressions for dipole and quadrupole emission exhibit excellent agreement with numerical computations, providing simple, ready-to-use formulas. These expressions are benchmarked against full numerical results to confirm their accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of these processes in the soft emission limit. Our results show that additional corrections are necessary when applying factorization to ensure consistency between the soft energy-differential cross section and the full counterparts across a broad energy range. Finally, we investigate the regime of perturbative validity in terms of the model parameters, identifying the conditions under which our results are applicable.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis from Dark Matter Coannihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal extension of the type-I seesaw model to realise leptogenesis from the co-annihilation of dark sector particles. The type-I seesaw model is extended with a singlet fermion and two singlet scalars charged under a $Z_{2}$ symmetry. The $Z_{2}$-odd singlet scalar is the dark matter candidate. Here the usual type-I seesaw mechanism generates neutrino mass, and a net lepton asymmetry is generated from the co-annihilation of the dark matter and the $Z_2$-odd singlet fermion. The $Z_{2}$-even singlet scalar is important in dark matter phenomenology. Successful leptogenesis is possible at TeV-scale, unlike the vanilla case. This minimal extension provides an elegant explanation of successful leptogenesis with direct connection to the dark matter abundance in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mass Generation in QED: Miransky scaling and Schr\"odinger-like infinite well and barrier potentials supporting a bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the electron propagator in QED in three and four space-time dimensions. Our analysis addresses the non-perturbative phenomenon of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, which requires a critical value of the coupling for the dynamical generation of electron masses, encoded in the infrared behavior of the corresponding Green function. With a minimalistic truncation of the infinite tower of equations and adopting standard assumptions, the resulting gap equation is linearized and transformed into a Schr\"odinger-like equation with an auxiliary potential barrier (or well) subjected to boundary conditions for both high and low momenta. The dynamical mass is then associated with the zero mode of the corresponding Schr\"odinger-like operator and follows the Miransky scaling law, as expected.</description>

      <title>Probing Flavour Deconstruction via Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the production of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in extensions of the Standard Model based on Flavour Deconstruction (FD). The link fields inherent to FD generically form a rich scalar sector, with sizeable couplings at the TeV scale, providing natural conditions for strong FOPTs and correspondingly large GW emission. We identify the key parameters controlling the GW spectrum and enabling its detection at future GW observatories. In particular, we find that while FD scenarios can yield detectable signals, the resulting spectra typically peak at higher frequencies than the millihertz range. As a consequence, a positive observation at LISA is possible but not guaranteed, while the signal falls in the range of mid-band proposals, making FD models an intriguing target for upcoming GW searches.</description>

      <title>Observing Double Higgs Production at the LHC via Neutrino Feature Engineering in $hh\to b\bar{b}\ell\ell\nu\nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double Higgs production is challenging even at the High Luminosity LHC. The Standard Model (SM) $hh\to b\bar{b}WW(ZZ)\to b\bar{b}\ell\ell\nu\nu$ has a moderate cross section compared to other decay modes, but its backgrounds, mainly top quark pairs and Drell-Yan production, are overwhelming. In this work, we propose new kinematic features designed to improve the discrimination of double Higgs pairs, in the $b\bar{b}\ell\ell\nu\nu$ channel, with cut-based and multivariate analyses. The new features are built with the neutrinos' momenta solutions obtained from imposing mass constraints when calculating Higgsness and Topness variables. For the SM $hh$ production, we estimate a $3.7\sigma$ statistical significance from an optimized cut-based strategy, improving about 20% over the best estimates of the literature, and $5\sigma$ from a multivariate analysis if systematic uncertainties on the backgrounds are small. The new variables are constructed as ratios of kinematic functions of the particles' momenta, being less prone to systematic errors. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the solutions in reconstructing heavy scalar resonances and other variables of phenomenological importance.</description>

      <title>Searching for leptophilic composite asymmetric dark sector at $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite asymmetric dark matter (ADM) models provide a well-motivated paradigm that simultaneously explains dark matter (DM) relic density and matter-antimatter asymmetry. In these models, the mass of the DM candidate (the lightest dark baryon) is generated through the dark confinement scale dynamics. Although the leptophilic composite ADM model offers a viable framework, comprehensive studies of its collider phenomenology are absent. This work systematically explores novel signatures from leptophilic composite asymmetric dark sector at both low-energy and high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders as well as other existing collider constraints. We demonstrate detectability of TeV-scale mediators along with sub-GeV to GeV-scale lightest dark mesons at Belle II and its proposed far detector, GAZELLE, as well as CEPC experiments. Moreover, these experiments exhibit complementary coverage of the model parameter space.</description>

      <title>On the (Im)possibility of Electrically Charged Planck Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I revisit whether black-hole remnants, from sub-Planckian compact objects to Planck relics and up to (super)massive black holes, can preserve Standard-Model (SM) electric charge. Two exterior-field mechanisms -- Coulomb-focused capture from ambient media and QED Schwinger pair production -- robustly neutralize such objects across cosmic history. I first derive the general capture rate including both Coulomb and gravitational focusing, and sum the stepwise discharge time in closed form via the trigamma function, exhibiting transparent Coulomb- and gravity-dominated limits. I then integrate the Schwinger rate over the near-horizon region to obtain an explicit $\dot Q(Q)$ law: discharge proceeds until the horizon field falls below $E_{\rm crit}$, leaving a residual charge $Q_{\rm stop}^{(e)}\!\propto\! r_h^2$ that is $\ll e$ for Planck radii. Mapping the mass dependence from sub-Planckian to astrophysical scales, I also analyze dark-sector charges with heavy carriers (including kinetic mixing and massive mediators). In a conservative ``no-Schwinger'' limit where vacuum pair creation is absent, cumulative ambient exposures alone force discharge of any integer SM charge. Three possible loopholes remain. (i) A fine-tuned SM corner in which the relic sits arbitrarily close to Reissner-Nordstr\"om extremality so greybody factors suppress charged absorption, while Schwinger pair creation is absent due to Planck-scale physics. (ii) Charge relocated to a hidden $U(1)_D$ with no light opposite carriers, e.g. if the lightest state is very heavy and/or kinetic mixing with $U(1)_{\rm EM}$ is vanishingly small. (iii) Discrete or topological charges rather than ordinary SM electric charge. Outside these cases, the conclusion is robust: within SM electromagnetism, charged black-hole relics neutralize efficiently and cannot retain charge over cosmological times.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the nature of $\phi(2170)$ state in the $e^+e^- \to \phi \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12552v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of $\phi(2170)$ state in the $e^+e^- \to \phi \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction with the effective Lagrangian approach. In addition to the tree level contributions from the $\phi(1680)$ meson and a possible X(1750) state, we consider also the $K_1$-$K$-$\bar{K}$ intermediate state process from the perspective of triangular singularity. Based on the one-photon exchange approximation, a pair of $K_1 \bar{K}$ mesons was firstly produced, and then the $K_1$ meson subsequently decays into $\phi$ and $K$, and the $K\bar{K}$ pair produce the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ through the final state interactions, in which the scalar meson $f_0(980)$ is dynamically generated. We show that the inclusion of the triangle loop diagrams leads to a good description of the new BESIII measurements, especially for the structure of $\phi(2170)$. This provides a novel interpretation of the $\phi(2170)$ state, offering new insights into its fundamental nature which is still unclear. Furthermore, it is found that these measurements on the $e^+e^- \to \phi \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction can be used to determine some of the properties of two $K_1$ mesons with masses around 1610 MeV and 1895 MeV, which are crucial to reproduce the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Cabibbo-suppressed charged-current semileptonic decays of $\Xi_b$ baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first perturbative QCD calculations of the $\Xi_b \to (\Lambda, \Sigma)$ transition form factors at leading order in $\alpha_s$, which govern the Cabibbo-suppressed semileptonic decays $\Xi_b \to (\Lambda, \Sigma)\ell \nu_\ell$ with $\ell = e, \mu, \tau$. Using these form factors, we evaluate differential and integrated branching fractions and angular observables within the helicity formalism. The branching ratios are predicted to be of order $10^{-4}$ for $\Sigma$ final states and $10^{-5}$ for $\Lambda$ final states, making them accessible to ongoing experiments such as LHCb. Ratios of decay rates between $\tau$ and $e$ channels are also provided, offering new probes of lepton-flavor universality. Lepton-mass effects are found to significantly impact the integrated angular observables. Furthermore, a combined analysis of $b \to u$ and $b \to c$ transitions in $\Xi_b$ decays yields sub-percent precision for the ratios $\mathcal{R}_\ell(\Sigma/\Xi_c)$, enabling an independent determination of $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$ once the relevant decay-rate measurements become available.</description>

      <title>Strangeness production in $p$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV in the PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the single- and multi-strange particle productions in $p$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV using the PACIAE 4.0 model. The effects of the color reconnection (CR), rope hadronization (RH) as well as the partonic and hadronic rescatterings (PRS and HRS) on their productions are investigated, respectively. There are two kinds of CR considered: the multiparton interactions-based CR (MPI-CR) and the quantum chromodynamics-based CR (QCD-CR). The four mechanisms studied have little effect on kaon production. However, the QCD-CR scheme incorporating the junction topology gives an enhanced baryon production, but it is still not enough to describe the integrated yields of strange baryons. The combination of QCD-CR and RH scheme together with the flavor ropes (FR) and the string shoving (SS), i.e., QCD-CR+FR+SS, provides a good description of the production of strange baryons. PRS has a weak effect but HRS exerts a promoting effect on the production of multi-strange baryons ($\Xi$ and $\Omega$).</description>

      <title>Probabilities in Toy Regge models with odderons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibi;lity of a probabilistic interpretation is studied for the Regge-Gribov model in zero dimensional transverse world ("Toy") with interacting pomerons and odderons. It is found that the previously proposed recipe to introduce such interpretation in the model without odderons, does not work once odderons are included. Starting from the physically reasonable probabilites it leads to a pathological field theory violating $C$-parity invariance. Inversely, starting from an admissible field theory one comes to pathological probabilities, which not only violate $C$-nvariance but also allow particles to be created from or annihilated into the vacuum. A method is proposed to introduce reasonable probabilities besed directly on the Fock components of the wave function. Such probabilities manifest themselves in the multiplicity distributions of hadrons produced in high-energy collisions. The corresponding entropy grows with rapidity but saturates in the limit. It is found to be similar for processes of both parity exchanges.</description>

      <title>One-loop Renormalization of the Type-I Seesaw Model in the On-shell Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper arxiv:2507.21691, we have carried out one-loop renormalization of the type-I seesaw model in the modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\rm MS}$) scheme. In the present one, we continue to renormalize the type-I seesaw model in the on-shell scheme. Such an investigation is mainly motivated by the fact that the on-shell scheme has been widely adopted in the renormalization of the standard electroweak theory and implemented for its precision tests. We first specify the physical parameters in the on-shell scheme, and then fix the corresponding counterterms through on-shell renormalization conditions. In the presence of massive Majorana neutrinos, we propose a practical method to determine gauge-independent counterterms for the lepton flavor mixing matrix. With the explicit counterterms in both the $\overline{\rm MS}$ and on-shell schemes, we establish the matching relations of the electric charge, physical masses and flavor mixing matrix elements between these two schemes. Our results in the present and previous papers lay the foundation for precision calculations in the type-I seesaw model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New one- and two-loop contributions to the lepton's and nucleon's EDM, which are induced by an axion-like particle dark matter background, are examined. These contributions include effects from CP-violating ALP interactions with photons, leptons and nucleons. The contribution to the EDM is so larger it leads to new constraints on the CP violating couplings of axion-like particles, if the axion-like particle mass is smaller than $10^{-11} $ eV.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel analysis for vector charmonia and their nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ data (20 final states) from the BESIII and Belle in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV are analyzed with a semi three-body unitary coupled-channel model. Vector charmonium poles are extracted from the amplitudes obtained from the fit. We find well-known $\psi$ states listed in the PDG, and also several states near open-charm thresholds. The compositeness of the near-threshold poles suggests that $\psi(4040)$ could mainly consist of a $D^*\bar{D}^*$-molecule component, rather than a conventionally accepted quark-model $\psi(3S)$ state. Also, $\psi(4230)$ and $\psi(4360)$ might be substantial mixtures of $D_1(2420)\bar{D}$, $D_1(2420)\bar{D}^*$, $D_s^*\bar{D}_s^*$, and $c\bar{c}$ components.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of theoretical and phenomenological studies on the partonic structure of nuclei and small-$x$ QCD dynamics using photon-nucleus $(\gamma A$) scattering in heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs). Focusing on nuclear shadowing, we review implications of coherent charmonium and inclusive dijet production in Pb-Pb UPCs at the LHC and discuss the potential of inelastic $\gamma A$ scattering accompanied by forward neutrons in a zero degree calorimeter (ZDC).</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD below charm threshold: theory and tensions with $e^+e^-$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we carefully assess the theory prediction for $R(s)$ below charm threshold, $R_{uds}$, and address tensions with the existing data, notably with the 2021 BES-III results. We analyze the uncertainty of the perturbative QCD description in the light of renormalons making use of the large-$\beta_0$ limit and the renormalon-free gluon-condensate scheme. We provide a reliable estimate of the duality violation contributions; we show they are sizable up to $2.5$~GeV and improve the agreement between theory and data, but are negligible for higher energies. We then combine the available experimental data for $R_{uds}$ and find the data sets to be mutually compatible. Finally, we compare theory and data, both locally and in their contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Theory is compatible with the combined data but discrepancies with the BES-III data reach more than 3$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Suppression in Diffractive Vector Meson Production within the Color Glass Condensate Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a recent global Bayesian analysis of diffractive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions within the color glass condensate (CGC) framework to investigate potential modifications of the nucleon structure inside nuclei. To this end, we perform fits that allow the effective nucleon structure parameters in Pb nuclei to differ from those of free protons. This approach directly addresses the question of whether the proton's spatial gluon distribution at intermediate to large $x$ is modified in the nuclear environment. We compare results obtained with shared and independent nucleon structure parameters and assess the impact on the simultaneous description of $\gamma+p$ data from HERA and the LHC, as well as $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ data from the LHC. Our findings show that there is no hint of difference in the nucleon structure beyond those already present in the CGC when embedding nucleons inside a nuclear environment.</description>

Abstract: We show how the Born-Oppenheimer effective field theory (BOEFT) provides a unified description of ordinary and exotic quarkonia grounded on the non-relativistic expansions of QCD and supplemented with lattice QCD inputs. We apply BOEFT to tetraquarks, pentaquarks, quarkonium hybrids and to assess threshold effects in the quarkonium spectrum.</description>

      <title>Cogenesis of baryon and lepton number asymmetries matching the EMPRESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a simple supersymmetric $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the standard model can explain simultaneously the large electron neutrino asymmetry hinted by the recent EMPRESS data as well as the observed tiny baryon number asymmetry via the resonant leptogenesis mechanism. The condensation of $B-L$ Higgs dominating the universe at its decay is the sole source for these generation processes. Here, the infrequent decays of the $B-L$ Higgs to heavy right handed neutrinos and successive prompt decays of these right handed neutrinos around the electroweak phase transition produce the observed baryon number asymmetry, while the complete decay of the same $B-L$ Higgs at a later epoch leads to a large lepton number asymmetry. The right amounts of both asymmetries are found to be obtained for the symmetry-breaking scale $v_\phi \sim 10^{10}~{\rm GeV}$. Moreover, in a close connection to the positivity of both asymmetries, seemingly only the normal mass hierarchy of light neutrino species works. Finally, the gravitational wave background from the topologically stable strong type-I cosmic strings, generated from the breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, can be within the reach of future experiments such as ultimate DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Searching for heavy resonances via oblique parameters in non-linear effective frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of a general non-linear effective field theory describing the electroweak symmetry breaking, we perform a detailed analysis of the next-to-leading contributions to the electroweak oblique parameters $S$ and $T$ from hypothetical heavy resonance states strongly coupled to Standard Model fields. This work extends our previous results by including parity-odd operators in the effective Lagrangian, contributions from fermionic cuts, and up-to-date experimental constraints. We demonstrate that in strongly-coupled ultraviolet completions satisfying both Weinberg Sum Rules -- as is the case in asymptotically free gauge theories -- the vector and axial-vector resonance masses are constrained to lie above $10\,$TeV. Conversely, scenarios allowing for lighter resonances with masses between $2\,$and $10\,$TeV necessarily imply a violation of the second Weinberg Sum Rule.</description>

      <title>Probing Geometrical NSI at the DUNE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the implications of a novel non-standard interaction (NSI) of neutrinos. This interaction is geometric in origin -- it arises because the propagation of fermions in curved spacetime induces torsion. This torsion is non-propagating and can be eliminated from the action, resulting in a four-fermion interaction in a torsion-free background. The new interaction modifies the behaviour of the neutrinos passing through matter by introducing additional coupling terms, resulting in a new component in the effective potential. As a result, the neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter are altered. The relevant probabilities are computed using the Cayley-Hamilton formalism. We then explore the potential to probe these torsion-induced NSI in the proposed DUNE experiment. Constraints on the parameters characterizing the torsional effects are obtained. By selecting representative values of torsion parameters to which the DUNE experiment is sensitive, we analyse how these geometric interactions affect the experiment's sensitivity to determine neutrino mass hierarchy, the octant of the 2-3 leptonic mixing angle, and the CP phase. We also examine the new parameter degeneracies introduced by torsion effects and assess their impact on the overall sensitivities of DUNE. We find that the additional parameter degeneracies in the presence of torsion significantly affect the octant sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Smallness of neutrino masses and leptogenesis in 331 composite Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry down to SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that an approximate discrete Z_2 symmetry may give rise to tiny masses of the left-handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting axion dark matter with nonlinear transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two of the present authors showed that even when the axion momentum is much smaller than its mass, the axion can still behave like radiation if its energy density greatly exceeds the maximum potential energy set by the cosine-type potential. As the energy density redshifts down to the potential scale, a nonlinear transition occurs, during which the axion's adiabatic invariant is not conserved. In this paper, we revisit the analysis of axion dark matter by incorporating the effects of this nonlinear transition through a precise study of the axion spectrum. We demonstrate that in the parameter region with a relatively small decay constant, often favored in axion search experiments, special care is required when estimating the axion abundance and spectrum. We also highlight a scenario in which axions are produced through the stimulated decay of a modulus, a situation that may naturally arise in the string axiverse, where the nonlinear transition occurs across a wide parameter region. Furthermore, we discuss related phenomena, including QCD axion dark matter, the formation of axion clumps such as miniclusters and axion stars, gravitational wave production, and formation of primordial black holes as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Do large QCD corrections to di-Higgs decay survive parton showering? A study of $HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While significant effort has been devoted to precision calculations of the production of two Higgs bosons via gluon fusion, the treatment of their decays in this process has only recently begun to attract attention. It has been found that fixed-order QCD corrections to fiducial di-Higgs decay rates involving the $b\bar{b}$ decay channel can be substantial. Considering $HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$, we show that such corrections arise predominantly from sensitivity to soft and collinear QCD radiation at fixed order, and that they are largely washed out once parton showers are included.</description>

      <title>Axion-photon conversion in transient compact stars: Systematics, constraints, and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnetic conversion of ultra-relativistic axion-like particles (ALPs) into photons in compact-star environments, focusing on the hot, transient conditions of core-collapse supernova (SN) remnants and neutron-star mergers (NSMs). We address previously overlooked uncertainties, particularly the suppression caused by ejected matter near the stellar surface, a region crucial to the conversion process. We derive analytical expressions for the transition rate; they reveal the influence of key parameters and their uncertainties. We update constraints using historical gamma-ray data from SN~1987A and find $g_{a\gamma}&lt;5\times10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a\lesssim10^{-9}$ meV. We also forecast sensitivities for a future Galactic SN and for NSMs, assuming observations with Fermi-LAT or similar gamma-ray instruments. We distinguish ALPs -- defined as coupling only to photons and produced via Primakoff scattering -- from axions, which also couple to nucleons and emerge through nuclear bremsstrahlung. We omit pionic axion production due to its large uncertainties and inconsistencies, though it could contribute comparably to bremsstrahlung under optimistic assumptions. For the compact sources, we adopt time-averaged one-zone models, guided by numerical simulations, to enable clear and reproducible parametric studies.</description>

      <title>Lowering the Horizon on Dark Energy: A Late-Time Response to Early Solutions for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model-independent null test of the late-time cosmological response to a reduced sound horizon, as typically required by early-universe solutions to the Hubble tension. In this approach, we phenomenologically impose a shorter sound horizon without modeling early-universe physics to isolate its impact on late-time dark energy inference. Using baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae (SN), big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), and local $H_0$ data, while explicitly avoiding CMB anisotropies, we examine how this calibration shift propagates into constraints on the dark energy equation of state. We find that lowering $r_d$ systematically drives the $w_0$-$w_a$ posterior toward less dynamical, quintessence-like behavior, bringing it closer to $\Lambda$CDM. This result underscores that some of the apparent evidence for evolving or phantom-like dark energy may reflect early-universe assumptions rather than genuine late-time dynamics. More broadly, our analysis highlights the importance of carefully disentangling calibration effects from physical evolution in interpreting forthcoming results from DESI and future surveys.</description>

      <title>Search for Quintessence-Like Pseudoscalar Dark Energy Effects on $^{56}\text{Fe}$ Nuclear Transition Energies in Supernova 1991T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy remains one of the most important unanswered problems in physics. Here we use gamma-ray spectra from the Type Ia supernova 1991T to constrain the recent evolution of a dynamical pseudoscalar quintessence-like field $Q(t)$. We found that the 1991T gamma rays emitted by the $^{56}\text{Fe}$ nuclei observed by COMPTEL aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory were slightly shifted to lower energies with respect to terrestrial values, with the average fractional energy shift of both the first and second excited states found to be $\delta E/E = -0.006\pm0.008$ including statistical and systematic errors. Assuming that this energy shift is caused by a dynamical QCD axion-like pseudoscalar field $Q(t)$, we find that observed energy deviations are consistent with a fractional rate of change of the pion mass given by $\delta \dot{m_{\pi}}/m_{\pi}=-(6\pm9)\times10^{-11}\text{ yr}^{-1}$. The observed energy deviation was also used to determine the rate of change of the quintessence-like field ($\dot{Q}_0$) for tracking models: $\dot{Q}_{0,max} = (3\pm 4)\times10^7 \text{ GeV/yr}$. Our findings are consistent with the cosmological constant ($\dot{Q}_0 =0$). Furthermore, we have demonstrated how nuclear spectra produced by astrophysical events can be used to inform the nature and behavior of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Comparing Minimal and Non-Minimal Quintessence Models to 2025 DESI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we examine the 2025 DESI analysis of dark energy, which suggests that dark energy is evolving in time with an increasing equation of state $w$. We explore a wide range of quintessence models, described by a potential function $V(\varphi)$, including: quadratic potentials, quartic hilltops, double wells, cosine functions, Gaussians, inverse powers. We find that while some provide improvement in fitting to the data, compared to a cosmological constant, the improvement is only modest. We then consider non-minimally coupled scalars which can help fit the data by providing an effective equation of state that temporarily obeys $w&lt;-1$ and then relaxes to $w&gt;-1$. Since the scalar is very light, this leads to a fifth force and to time evolution in the effective gravitational strength, which are both tightly constrained by tests of gravity. For a very narrow range of carefully selected non-minimal couplings we are able to evade these bounds, but not for generic values.</description>

      <title>How Theory-Informed Priors Affect DESI Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have been interpreted to suggest that dark energy may be evolving. In this work, we examine how prior choices affect such conclusions. Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary use of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we construct theory-informed priors on $(w_0, w_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF), trained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the distribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\Lambda$CDM parameters. In the combined $\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find that the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can be reduced from $\sim 3.1\sigma$ to $\sim 1.3\sigma$ once theory-informed priors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. For completeness, we also analyze combinations that include Type Ia supernova data, showing similar shifts toward the $\Lambda$CDM limit. Taken together, the observed sensitivity to prior choices in these analyses arises because uniform priors - often mischaracterized as "uninformative" - can actually bias inferences toward unphysical parameter regions. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of adopting physically motivated priors to ensure robust cosmological inferences, especially when evaluating new hypotheses with only marginal statistical support. Lastly, our NF-based framework achieves these results by post-processing existing MCMC chains, requiring $\approx 1$ hour of additional CPU compute time on top of the base analysis - a dramatic speedup over direct model sampling that highlights the scalability of this approach for testing diverse theoretical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Gaia's detection of stars on wide orbits around black holes opens a new observational window on dark matter structures -- such as scalar clouds and dark matter spikes -- predicted in a range of theoretical scenarios. Using precise radial velocity measurements of these systems, we derive state-of-the-art constraints on dark matter density profiles and particle masses in previously unexplored regions of parameter space. We also test the black hole hypothesis against the alternative of a boson star composed of light scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Monopole-Antimonopole Pair Production at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10747v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The monopole production at LHC crucially depends on the monopole production mechanism. We show that, if the monopole production mechanism at LHC is the thermal fluctuation of the Higgs vacuum as the early universe did, it is practically impossible for LHC to produce the monopole, even with the future FCC energy upgrade. This is because the temperature of the p-p fireball is simply too low to produce the monopole. But if the monopole production mechanism is the Drell-Yan and/or Schwinger mechanism, the 14 TeV LHC could produce the monopole in the form of the monopolium of mass around 5,7 TeV even when the monopole mass becomes 11 TeV. Or, it could produce the monopole when the mass is less than 7 TeV. Our result tells that, if the monopole production mechanism at LHC becomes the thermal fluctuation, searching for the remnant monopoles produced in the early universe could be the only way to detect the electroweak monopole. We discuss the physical implications of our result.</description>

Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of Weinberg's $Z_2\times Z_2$ symmetric three-Higgs-doublet potential, allowing for spontaneous violation of CP due to complex vacuum expectation values. An overview of all possible ways of satisfying the stationary-point conditions is given, with one, two or three non-vanishing vacuum expectation values, together with conditions for CP conservation in terms of basis invariants. All possible ways of satisfying the conditions for CP conservation are given. Scans of allowed parameter regions are given, together with measures of CP violation, in terms of the invariants. The light states identified in an earlier paper are further explored in terms of their CP-violating couplings. Loop-induced CP violation in $WWZ$ couplings, as well as charge-asymmetric scattering are also commented on.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to probe light-quark dipole interactions at lepton colliders using the azimuthal asymmetry of a collinear dihadron pair $(h_1h_2)$ produced in association with another hadron $h'$. This asymmetry, arising from quantum interference in the quark spin space, is exclusively sensitive to dipole interactions at the leading power of the new physics scale and simultaneously probes both the real and imaginary components of the dipole couplings. By combining all possible channels of $h'$, this method allows for disentangling the up and down quark dipole moments and has the potential to significantly strengthen current constraints by one to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Tidal Resonance in Binary Neutron Star Inspirals: A High-Precision Study in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal resonance of the fundamental ($f$-)mode in spinning neutron stars, robustly tracing the onset of the excitation to its saturation, using numerical relativity for the first time. We performed long-term ($\approx15$~orbits) fully relativistic simulations of a merger of two highly and retrogradely spinning neutron stars. The resonance window of the $f$-mode is extended by self-interaction, and the nonlinear resonance continues up to the final plunging phase. We observe that the quasi-circular orbit is maintained throughout since the dissipation of orbit motion due to the resonance is coherent with that due to gravitational waves. The $f$-mode resonance causes a variation in the stellar spin of $\gtrsim6.3\%$ in the linear regime and much more as $\sim33\%$ during the later nonlinear regime. At the merger, a phase shift of $\lesssim40$~radians is rendered in the gravitational waveform as a consequence of the angular momentum and energy transfers into the neutron star oscillations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an all-order analysis of double-logarithmic corrections to the so-called soft-overlap contribution to heavy-to-light transition form factors at large hadronic recoil. Specifically, we study $B_c \to \eta_c$ transitions within a perturbative non-relativistic framework, treating both the bottom and charm quarks as heavy with the hierarchy $m_b \gg m_c \gg\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. Our diagrammatic analysis shows that double-logarithmic corrections arise from two distinct sources: Exponentiated soft-gluon effects described by standard Sudakov factors, and rapidity-ordered soft-quark configurations, leading to implicit integral equations, which so far have only been studied in the context of energetic muon-electron backward scattering. We find that the all-order structure of the double logarithms is governed by a novel type of coupled integral equations, which encode the non-trivial interplay between these two effects. Whereas a closed-form solution to these equations is currently unknown, we present useful iteration formulas, and derive the asymptotic behaviour of the soft-overlap form factor for infinitely large recoil energies, showing that the Sudakov suppression is somewhat weakened by the intertwined soft-quark and soft-gluon corrections. In a broader context, our findings shed light onto the physical origin and mathematical structure of endpoint divergences arising from soft-collinear factorization and the related Feynman mechanism for power-suppressed hard exclusive processes.</description>

      <title>Towards a Manifestly Causal Approach to Particle Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new, probability-level approach to calculations in scalar field particle scattering. The approach involves the implicit summation over final states, which makes causality manifest since retarded propagators emerge naturally. Novel diagrams represent algebraic terms at the probability level, akin to Feynman diagrams at the amplitude level. We conjecture a list of rules that generate all probability-level diagrams for particle scattering processes in which one is fully inclusive over final states that contain no initial-state particles. These rules are confirmed using some fixed-order examples. The inclusivity and causal structure of this formalism may offer insights into the cancellation of infrared divergences if applied to gauge theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from Field-Dependent Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological stasis is a new type of epoch in the cosmological timeline during which the cosmological abundances of different energy components -- such as vacuum energy, matter, and radiation -- remain constant despite the expansion of the universe. Previous studies have shown that stasis naturally arises in various scenarios beyond the Standard Model, either through sequential decays of states in large towers or via the annihilation of a single particle species in thermal equilibrium with itself. In this work, we demonstrate that stasis can also emerge from the decay of a single particle species whose decay width is dynamically regulated by a scalar field rolling down a Hubble-mass potential. By analyzing the fixed points of the dynamical system, we identify regions of the parameter space where stasis occurs as a global attractor of cosmic evolution. We also find that, depending on the specific abundance configuration, stasis solutions can manifest as either a stable node with asymptotic behavior or a stable spiral exhibiting intrinsic oscillations. Furthermore, we present an explicit model for this realization of stasis and explore its phenomenological constraints and implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of a dynamical framework within doubly special relativity theories has impeded the development of a corresponding phenomenology of modified interactions. In this work we show that in a model based on the classical basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e and total momentum conservation, one has a well-defined cross section of the photon-photon annihilation process, once a prescription for the channel treatment is set. The modification of the interaction can lead to observable effects in the opacity of the Universe to very high-energy gamma rays when the gamma-ray energy approaches the energy scale of the deformation. The magnitude and observability of this deformation are examined as functions of the gamma-ray energy and source distance.</description>

      <title>Precision DIS thrust predictions for HERA and EIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present predictions for the DIS 1-jettiness event shape $\tau_1^b$, or DIS thrust, using the framework of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) for factorization, resummation of large logarithms, and rigorous treatment of nonperturbative power corrections, matched to fixed-order QCD away from the resummation region. Our predictions reach next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (N$^3$LL) accuracy in resummed perturbation theory, matched to $O(\alpha_s^2)$ fixed-order QCD calculations obtained using the program NLOJet++. We include a rigorous treatment of hadronization corrections, which are universal across different event shapes and kinematic variables $x$ and $Q$ at leading power, and supplement them with a systematic scheme to remove $O(\Lambda_\textrm{QCD})$ renormalon ambiguities in their definition. The framework of SCET allows us to connect smoothly the nonperturbative, resummation, and fixed-order regions, whose relative importance varies with $x$ and $Q$, and to rigorously estimate theoretical uncertainties, across a broad range of $x$ and $Q$ covering existing experimental results from HERA as well as expected new measurements from the upcoming Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC). Our predictions will serve as an important benchmark for the EIC program, enabling the precise determination of the QCD strong coupling $\alpha_s$ and the universal nonperturbative first moment parameter $\Omega_1$.</description>

Abstract: Recently, $B\to PP$ decays ($B = \{B^0, B^+, B_s^0\}$, $P = \{ \pi, K \}$) were analyzed under the assumption of flavor SU(3) symmetry (SU(3)$_F$). Although the individual fits to $\Delta S=0$ or $\Delta S=1$ decays are good, it was found that the combined fit is very poor: there is a $3.6\sigma$ disagreement with the SU(3)$_F$ limit of the standard model (SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$). One can remove this discrepancy by adding SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects, but 1000\% SU(3)$_F$ breaking is required. In this paper, we extend this analysis to include decays in which there is an $\eta$ and/or $\eta'$ meson in the final state. We now find that the combined fit exhibits a $4.1\sigma$ discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$, and 1000\% SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects are still required to explain the data. These results are rigorous, group-theoretically -- no theoretical assumptions have been made. But when one adds some theoretical input motivated by QCD factorization, the discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$ grows to $4.9\sigma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze two minimal extensions of the Standard Model featuring a spontaneously broken global, chiral, and anomaly-free $U(1)_D$ symmetry. This breaking generates naturally small Dirac neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism and yields a physical massless Goldstone boson, the Diracon. Although both models share the same particle content and scalar potential, their distinct symmetry breaking pattern leads to remarkably different phenomenological and cosmological signatures. In the first model, the Diracon couples weakly to charged leptons but right-handed neutrinos can be efficiently produced in the early Universe, resulting in stringent constraints from the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$. Conversely, in the second one, right-handed neutrino production is suppressed, and flavour-violating processes such as $\mu \to e \mathcal{D}$ provide the most promising probes. These simple but elegant models showcase the complementarity between cosmological observations and low-energy flavour experiments in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to the origin of the mass of the nucleon. We first review the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor, which generates most of the nucleon mass via the gluon fields and thus contributes even in the case of vanishing quark masses. We then discuss the contributions to the nucleon mass that do originate from the Higgs mechanism via the quark masses, reviewing the current status of nucleon $\sigma$-terms that encode the corresponding matrix elements.</description>

      <title>$WWh$ anomalous couplings at one loop from a seesaw variant of radiatively-induced neutrino masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After the successful measurement of the Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider, the determination of whether it corresponds to either the minimal version of the Higgs scalar, provided by the Standard Model, or to some new physics, so far unknown, has become a main objective of the high-energy-physics community. In particular, the investigation of the couplings of this particle with the rest of the Standard-Model field content is a central task. To this aim, in the present paper we consider a variant of the seesaw neutrino-mass-generating mechanism in which the masses of light neutrinos are generated via radiative corrections of the neutrino 2-point function. In this framework, we calculate the contributions from virtual Majorana neutrinos to the $WWh$ vertex, at one loop. A set of anomalous couplings, some of them $CP$-even and the others $CP$-odd, emerge from this calculation. We perform numerical estimations of these anomalous couplings by taking into account the role of the $WWh$ vertex in (1) $Wh$ production from $pp$ collisions and (2) in Higgs production by vector-boson fusion, occurring in some lepton collider. Our estimations show that all the generated anomalous couplings are beyond current experimental sensitivity. However, we note that $CP$-conserving anomalous couplings could be as large as $\sim10^{-3}$, which would be near the reach of the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider. On the other hand, $CP$-odd effects, amounting to $\sim10^{-4}$, turn out to be well below expectations for the Compact Linear Collider by about 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Chiral and deconfinement transitions in spin-polarized quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of spin polarization in strongly interacting matter by introducing a finite spin potential, $\mu_\Sigma$, which effectively controls the spin density of the system without requiring rotation or specific boundary conditions. Inspired by recent lattice QCD simulations that incorporated such a potential, we implement this approach within an effective QCD framework. Our results show that increasing spin polarization leads to a simultaneous decrease in both the chiral and deconfinement restoration temperatures. The resulting phase structure is qualitatively consistent with lattice findings, and notably, we observe the emergence of a first-order chiral phase transition at low temperature. These results suggest that spin-polarized environments can significantly impact the QCD phase diagram and offer a controlled route for studying spin effects in hot and dense matter.</description>

      <title>Axial-vector molecular structures $B_{c}^{\ast \pm} B_{c}^{\mp}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axial-vector molecular structure $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}=(B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{-} + B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+})/2$ is explored in QCD sum rule framework. The mass and current coupling of this compound are found by means of the two-point sum rule method. It turns out that the mass of $\mathcal{M} _{\mathrm{AV}}$ is equal to $m=(12770 \pm 60)~\mathrm{MeV}$ making possible its dissociations to pairs of $J/\psi \eta_b$, $\Upsilon \eta_c$, $ B_{c}^{\ast +} B_{c}^{-}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+}$ mesons. The partial widths of these decay modes contain the strong couplings at $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$-meson-meson vertices which are calculated by utilizing the three-point sum rule method. The full decay width of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ is formed due to these dominant processes and amounts to $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}]=(93 \pm 14)~ \mathrm{MeV}$. Our results for parameters $m$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{AV}}]$ of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ are useful for experimental studies of various fully heavy four-quark mesons.</description>

      <title>Decoding the role of $\rho$ mesonic states for elucidating the $e^+e^-\to a_2(1320)\pi$ data and other reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the BESIII Collaboration observed a $\rho$-like structure $Y(2044)$ in $e^+e^-\to a_2(1320)\pi$, suggesting that $Y(2044)$ may be a candidate of vector meson $\rho(2D)$ by comparing resonance parameters. However, the theoretical prediction for the combined branching ratio $\Gamma_{e^+e^-}\mathcal{B}_{a_2(1320)\pi}$ for the pure $\rho(2D)$ state is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental value. To resolve this discrepancy and decipher the nature of $Y(2044)$, this work propose an $S$-$D$ mixing scheme to reanalyze the cross section of $e^+e^-\to a_2(1320)\pi$, and find that the aforementioned branching ratio discrepancy can be resolved. Our results show that the $Y(2044)$ structure can be reproduced by introducing four theoretically predicted $S$-$D$ mixing $\rho$ meson states $\rho_{3S-2D}^{\prime}$, $\rho_{3S-2D}^{\prime\prime}$, $\rho_{4S-3D}^{\prime}$, and $\rho_{4S-3D}^{\prime\prime}$ as intermediate resonances, in which dominant contribution arises from $\rho_{3S-2D}^{\prime\prime}$ and their inference effect is also significant. Furthermore, we reanalyzed five additional isospin vector processes $e^+e^-\to \omega\pi^0$, $e^+e^-\to f_1(1285)\pi^+\pi^-$, $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$, $e^+e^-\to \rho \eta$, and $e^+e^-\to \eta^{\prime} \pi^+\pi^-$ based on the same $S$-$D$ mixing framework, and simultaneously reproduced their experimental cross section data. This work provides a unified framework to elucidate all observed $\rho$-like structures near 2 GeV in the $e^+e^-$ annihilation processes, and suggests that the $S$-$D$ mixing effect may be crucial for understanding the mass spectrum and decay behaviors of the higher $\rho$ meson states.</description>

      <title>Signature of Majorana neutrinos in equal-sign W-production by lepton scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question whether standard-model neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles is presently undecided. In principle it could be decided in favor of a Majorana signature if same-sign charged lepton scattering would be observed to produce $W$-boson pairs, which is a lepton-number violating process. The cross section of this scattering process is computed; depending on the initial state the result gives access to different components of the mass matrix. It could also shed light on physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Localized Chiral Magnetic Effect in equilibrium QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of a non-uniform magnetic background field on the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in equilibrium QCD using lattice simulations with 2+1 flavors of dynamical staggered quarks at the physical point. We show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field the CME manifests itself via a localized electromagnetic current density along the direction of the field, which integrates to zero over the full volume. Our primary observable is the leading-order coefficient of the current in a chiral chemical potential expansion, which we compute for various lattice spacings and extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our findings demonstrate that, even though the global spatial average of the CME conductivity vanishes in equilibrium, steady currents still exist locally. Thus, spatially modulated magnetic fields provide a possible way of generating a non-trivial CME signal in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal flow decorrelations in light ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed analysis of longitudinal flow decorrelations in light ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider(LHC) energies for the first time. We compare different theoretical models of the oxygen structure and find that certain observables, such as the flow vector correlator, can distinguish between them, particularly highlighting differences between the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) structure and other models, such as Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM), which behave similarly. We further examine flow decorrelations across different systems, including d+Au and O+O collisions at 200 GeV, as well as Ne+Ne and O+O collisions at 6.37 TeV, indicating a hierarchy in decorrelations that underscores the complexity of these interactions. Our findings emphasize that the role of asymmetry in d+Au collisions and its impact on flow correlations is mitigated using a modified flow correlation defined as a ratio of two flow vector covariances derived from different pairs of pseudorapidity bins. Additionally, our analysis of flow angle decorrelations shows diverse distributions across various systems, finding distinct patterns in d+Au collisions compared to other collision systems.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transitions and finite-temperature effects of quantum criticality in Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa-type models such as the chiral Ising, chiral XY, and chiral Heisenberg models, serve as effective descriptions of two-dimensional Dirac semi-metals undergoing quantum phase transitions into various symmetry-broken ordered states. Their relativistic quantum critical points govern the systems' physical behavior in the vicinity of the transition also at finite temperatures, which is strongly influenced by critical order-parameter and chiral fermion fluctuations. Here, we explore the effect of these fluctuations at zero and finite temperature, both in the Dirac phase and in the Mott phases with spontaneously broken symmetry. To that end, we set up a functional renormalization group approach, which allows us to systematically calculate the quantum phase diagrams and scaling behavior at and near quantum criticality. We explicitly estimate quantum critical exponents, calculate the quasiparticle weight of the chiral Dirac excitations, and determine the extent of the quantum critical fan. Furthermore, we expose a semi-metallic precondensation regime where order-parameter fluctuations destroy order at finite temperature and we show the related manifestation of the Coleman-Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. For the chiral XY model, we also expose signatures of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics in a system that includes strong fermion fluctuations. In view of recent experimental developments on correlated phases in highly tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials, our work aims at a more comprehensive theoretical description of relativistic quantum criticality in semi-metals, including non-Dirac-liquid behavior.</description>

      <title>Inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_s$ meson: A first-principles lattice QCD calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a first-principles theoretical study of the inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_s$ meson. We performed a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation using the gauge ensembles produced by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with dynamical light, strange and charm quarks with physical masses and employed the so-called Hansen-Lupo-Tantalo (HLT) method to extract the decay rate and the first two lepton-energy moments from the relevant Euclidean correlators. We have carefully taken into account all sources of systematic errors, including the ones associated with the continuum and infinite-volume extrapolations and with the HLT spectral reconstruction method. We obtained results in very good agreement with the currently available experimental determinations and with a total accuracy at the few-percent level, of the same order of magnitude of the experimental error. Our total error is dominated by the lattice QCD simulations statistical uncertainties and is certainly improvable. From the results presented and thoroughly discussed in this paper we conclude that it is nowadays possible to study heavy mesons inclusive semileptonic decays on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy. The phenomenological implications of our physical results are the subject of a companion letter [1].</description>

Abstract: We present the results of a first-principles theoretical study of the inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_{s}$ meson. We performed a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation by taking into account all sources of systematic errors. A detailed discussion of our lattice calculation, demonstrating that inclusive semileptonic decays can nowadays be studied on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy, is the subject of a companion paper [1]. Here we focus on the phenomenological implications of our results. Using the current best estimates of the relevant Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, our theoretical predictions for the decay rate and for the first two lepton-energy moments are in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. We also argue that, while the inclusive $D_{s}$ channel is not yet competitive with the exclusive channels in the $|V_{cs}|$ determination, the situation can be significantly improved in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the color charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the global color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator. Moreover, there is a particular combination of the color charge fluctuations for the vacuum and for a system describable by a non-trivial density matrix that is independent that has a well-defined continuum limit</description>

      <title>Novel insight into centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centre-vortex surfaces are mapped out in four dimensions within the framework of SU(3) lattice gauge theory to understand the role of secondary loops that develop in three-dimensional visualisations of centre-vortex structure, appearing separate from the percolating cluster. Loops that initially appear disconnected in three-dimensional slices can originate from the same connected surface in four dimensions depending on the surface's curvature. For the first time, these secondary loops are identified as "connected" or "disconnected" with respect to the vortex sheet, allowing new insight into the evolution of centre-vortex geometry through the finite-temperature phase transition. At low temperatures, we find that secondary loops of any length primarily lie in the same sheet percolating the four-dimensional volume. Only a handful of small secondary sheets disconnected from the percolating sheet are identified. Above the phase transition, the vortex structure is still found to be dominated by a single large sheet but one that has aligned with the temporal dimension. With the near absence of any curvature orthogonal to the temporal dimension, connected secondary loops become vanishingly rare. Other novel quantities, such as the four-dimensional density of secondary sheets and the sheet sizes themselves, are analysed to build a complete picture of centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Does the high-energy AMS-02 positron flux originate from the dark matter density spikes around nearby black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements made by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) have detected accurate positron flux for energy range 1-1000 GeV. The energy spectrum can be best described by two source terms: the low-energy background diffusion term and an unknown high-energy source term. In this article, we discuss the possibility of the emission of positrons originating from dark matter annihilation in two nearby black hole X-ray binaries A0620-00 and XTE J1118+480. We show that the dark matter density spikes around these two black holes can best produce the observed AMS-02 high-energy positron flux due to dark matter annihilation with rest mass $m_{\rm DM} \approx 8000$ GeV via the $W^+W^-$ annihilation channel. This initiates a new proposal to account for the unknown high-energy source term in the AMS-02 positron spectrum.</description>
