      <title>Phenotype-structuring of non-local kinetic models of cell migration driven by environmental sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability of cells to form surface extensions, which enable them to non-locally probe the surrounding environment, plays a key role in cell migration. The existing mathematical models for collective migration of cell populations driven by this non-local form of environmental sensing rely on the simplifying assumption that cells in the population share the same cytoskeletal properties, and thus form surface extensions of the same size. To overcome this simplification, we develop a modelling framework wherein a population of migrating cells is structured by a continuous phenotypic variable that captures variability in structural properties of the cytoskeleton. The framework provides a multiscale representation of collective cell migration, from single-cell dynamics to population-level behaviours, as we start with a microscopic model that describes the dynamics of single cells in terms of stochastic processes. Next, we formally derive the mesoscopic counterpart of this model, which consists of a phenotype-structured kinetic equation for the cell distribution in each of phase and phenotype space. Then, considering an appropriately rescaled version of this kinetic equation, we formally derive the corresponding macroscopic model, which takes the form of a partial differential equation for the cell number density. To validate the formal procedure employed to derive the macroscopic model from the microscopic one, we first compare the results of numerical simulations of the two models. We then compare numerical solutions of the macroscopic model with the results of cell locomotion assays, to test the ability of the model to recapitulate qualitative features of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity microsecond-scale cellular imaging using two-axis compressed streak imaging fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressed streak imaging (CSI), introduced in 2014, has proven to be a powerful imaging technology for recording ultrafast phenomena such as light propagation and fluorescence lifetimes at over 150 trillion frames per second. Despite these achievements, CSI has faced challenges in detecting subtle intensity fluctuations in slow-moving, continuously illuminated objects. This limitation, largely attributable to high streak compression and motion blur, has curtailed broader adoption of CSI in applications such as cellular fluorescence microscopy. To address these issues and expand the utility of CSI, we present a novel encoding strategy, termed two-axis compressed streak imaging (TACSI) that results in significant improvements to the reconstructed image fidelity. TACSI introduces a second scanning axis which shuttles a conjugate image of the object with respect to the coded aperture. The moving image decreases the streak compression ratio and produces a flash and shutter phenomenon that reduces coded aperture motion blur, overcoming the limitations of current CSI technologies. We support this approach with an analytical model describing the two-axis streak compression ratio, along with both simulated and empirical measurements. As proof of concept, we demonstrate the ability of TACSI to measure rapid variations in cell membrane potentials using voltage-sensitive dye, which were previously unattainable with conventional CSI. This method has broad implications for high-speed photography, including the visualization of action potentials, muscle contractions, and enzymatic reactions that occur on microsecond and faster timescales using fluorescence microscopy.</description>

      <title>Spiral waves speed up cell cycle oscillations in the frog cytoplasm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiral waves are a well-known phenomenon in excitable media, playing critical roles in biological systems such as cardiac tissues, where they are involved in arrhythmias, and in slime molds, where they guide collective cell migration. However, their presence in the cytoplasm of cells has not been reported to date. In this study, we present the observation of spiral waves in a Xenopus laevis frog egg extract reconstituting periodic cell cycle transitions. We find that the emergence of these spiral waves accelerates the cell division cycle nearly twofold. Using two distinct computational models, we demonstrate that this behavior arises from generic principles and is driven primarily by time-scale separation in the cell cycle oscillator. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between these spiral waves and the more commonly observed target pattern waves in the frog cytoplasm, providing new insights into their dynamic interactions.</description>
