      <title>Cutting soft materials: how material differences shape the response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting soft materials is a complex process governed by the interplay of bulk large deformation, interfacial soft fracture, and contact forces with the cutting tool. Existing experimental characterizations and numerical models often fail to capture the variety of observed cutting behaviors, especially the transition from indentation to cutting and the roles of dissipative mechanisms. Here, we combine novel experimental cutting tests on three representative materials-a soft hydrogel, elastomer, and food-based materials-with a coupled computational model that integrates soft fracture, adhesion, and frictional interactions. Our experiments reveal material-dependent cutting behaviors, with abrupt or smooth transitions from indentation to crack initiation, followed by distinct steady cutting regimes. The computational model captures these behaviors and shows that adhesion and viscous cohesive forces dominate tangential stresses, while Coulomb friction plays a negligible role due to low contact pressures. Together, these results provide new mechanistic insights into the physics of soft cutting and offer a unified framework to guide the design of soft materials, cutting tools, and cutting protocols, with direct relevance to surgical applications and the engineering of food textures optimized for mastication.</description>

      <title>Competing Length Scales and Symmetry Frustration Govern Non-Universal Melting in 2D Core-softened Colloidal Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the melting behavior of two-dimensional colloidal crystals stabilized by a core-softened potential featuring two competing interaction length scales. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze three polymorphic solid phases -- low-density triangular, stripe, and kagome -- and uncover distinct melting pathways. The triangular and kagome crystals undergo abrupt first-order transitions, driven by the interplay between energetic frustration and structural reorganization. In particular, the LDT phase melts through a sharp transition induced by a crossover between the two characteristic length scales. In contrast, the stripe phase exhibits a continuous transition with liquid-crystalline features: orientational and translational order decay gradually, while intra-stripe mobility persists, consistent with a KTHNY-like scenario. These findings demonstrate that melting in 2D soft-matter systems is inherently non-universal and governed by the competition between lattice symmetry, frustration, and multiple interaction scales. Our results provide microscopic insight into melting mechanisms beyond classical universality classes and offer guiding principles for the design of self-assembled materials with tunable phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Learning general pair interactions between self-propelled particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic active matter systems, such as active colloids, often have complex interactions, which can be of hydrodynamic, chemical or electrostatic origin and cannot be computed from first principles. Here, we use Stochastic Force Inference to learn general pair interactions, including transverse forces and torques, between self-propelled Janus particles from experimental trajectories. We use data from two experiments: one where the particles flock, and one where the system remains disordered. The learned interactions are then fed to numerical simulations, which reproduce all the experimental observables and could be extrapolated to different densities. Overall, we find that the radial interaction is mostly repulsive and isotropic, while the angular interaction has a richer angular dependence, which controls the behavior of the system; the transverse interaction is negligible. Finally, testing the symmetry relations obeyed by the inferred interactions allows us to show that they cannot come from electrostatics only, so that they must have a hydrodynamic component.</description>

      <title>Topological signatures of jamming in granular force networks via persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials exhibit intricate force networks, often concentrated in chains rather than being uniformly distributed. These meso-scale structures are complex to characterize, owing to their heterogeneous and anisotropic nature. We present a topological analysis in which we characterize force networks by studying the connectivity of contact forces in granular materials. We obtain the force network data during the isotropic compression of a 2D granular ensemble, which comprises of bidisperse photoelastic disks. The force chains are visualized using a bright-field polariscope, which are then analyzed using photoelasticity techniques to get contact force information across all the particles in the granular ensemble. The forces and contact network are studied using topological descriptors. We analyze the evolution of these descriptors using methods developed in the areas of computational topology and persistent homology. Specifically, we evaluate the number of homology class generators to capture critical changes in network connectivity with the evolution of packing fraction. Building on previous applications of persistent homology, our topological analysis of the force network provides valuable insights by distinguishing different phases of particle interactions and revealing unique structural transitions around jamming and thus help enhance our understanding of the stability and jamming dynamics in granular systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Study of Rayleigh-Plateau Instability at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the Rayleigh-Plateau instability at the interface between two immiscible liquids of equal viscosity using molecular dynamics simulations. We examined two types of initial conditions: one involving a single-mode perturbation at the interface and the other without any imposed perturbation. The growth rate under single-mode perturbation showed strong agreement with classical theory, particularly for large cylinder radii.However, for smaller radii, the growth rate deviated significantly from the theoretical prediction. This discrepancy can be attributed to the effects of thermal fluctuations or pressure differences between the inside and outside of a cylinder. In contrast, with initial conditions free of perturbation, we observed a relationship between breakup time and minimum radius, where the power exponent decreased as the radius decreased. This result suggests that thermal fluctuations have a more substantial impact on systems of smaller dimensions. This study demonstrated that imposing single-mode perturbations effectively suppresses thermal noise and mode coupling, thereby yielding growth rates consistent with those predicted by linear stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Less is more: removing a single bond increases the toughness of elastic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the removal of a single bond affects the fracture behavior of triangular spring networks, whereby we systematically vary the position of the removed bond. Our simulations show that removing the bond has two contrasting effects on the fracture energy for initiation of crack propagation and on the fracture energy for failure of the entire network. A single missing bond can either lower or raise the initiation fracture energy, depending on its placement relative to the crack tip. In contrast, the failure fracture energy is always equal to or greater than that of a perfect network. For most initial placements of the missing bond, the crack path remains straight, and the increased failure fracture energy results from arrest at the point of maximum local fracture resistance. When the crack deviates from a straight path, we observe an even higher fracture energy, which we attribute primarily to crack bridging. This additional toughening mechanism becomes active only at low failure strains of the springs; at higher failure strains, the crack path tends to remain straight. Altogether, our results demonstrate that even a single bond removal can significantly enhance toughness, offering fundamental insights into the role of defects in polymer networks and informing the design of tough architected materials.</description>

      <title>Driven shear flow in biological magneto-active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active fluids made of powered suspended particles have unique abilities to self-generate flow and density structures. How such dynamics can be triggered and leveraged by external cues is a key question of both biological and applied relevance. Here we use magnetotactic bacteria to explore how chemotaxis and magnetotaxis -- leading, respectively, to positional and orientational responses -- combine to generate global scale flows. Such steady regime can be quantitatively captured by a magneto-active hydrodynamic model, while time-dependent magnetic driving unveils additional patterning complexity. Overall, our findings shed light on how active fluids respond to the ubiquitous situation of multiple external information, also suggesting routes for their manipulation.</description>

      <title>Contact point geometry governs structural build-up at rest in Portland cement-limestone blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early stiffening of fresh cement paste plays a key role in shaping and stability during casting and 3D printing. In Portland cement systems, this phenomenon arises from the formation of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), which stiffens grain-to-grain contacts. However, the role of powder characteristics such as particle size and morphology remains poorly understood. Here, we vary the fineness and grain shape by blending Portland cement with either coarse or fine limestone, leveraging the affinity of C-S-H to nucleate on limestone surfaces. By coupling calorimetry and rheometry, we relate the amount of formed hydration products to the increase in stiffness, and show that the mechanism of contact stiffening through C-S-H formation remains unchanged with limestone addition. Nevertheless, the rate of stiffening varies across blends. We find that these rates correlate with a characteristic length scale that captures particle size and shape. These results demonstrate that early stiffening depends not only on the amount of hydration products formed, but also on the geometry of the contacts where these products form, offering a framework for understanding more complex systems such as limestone-calcined clay cements.</description>

      <title>Multiscale contact mechanics for elastoplastic contacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We test Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory for elastoplastic solids, assuming a constant penetration hardness. Using a numerical model based on the boundary element method, we simulate the contact between a rough, rigid surface and an elastic-perfectly plastic half-space with a flat surface. The theory's predictions for elastic, plastic, and total contact area agree quantitatively with the numerical results. The simulations also support the boundary conditions assumed in the theory, namely that the stress probability vanishes at both zero and yield stress. These findings reinforce the validity of the theory for systems with constant hardness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analysis approach for intensity autocorrelation data, as measured with dynamic light scattering and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. Our analysis generalizes the established CONTIN and MULTIQ methods by direct nonlinear modeling of the $g_2$ function, enabling decomposition of complex dynamics without a priori knowledge of experimental scaling factors. We describe the mathematical formulation, implementation details, and strategies for solution, as well as demonstrate decompositions of soft matter dynamics data into distributions of diffusion rates/velocities. The open-source MATLAB implementation, including example data, is publicly available for adoption and further development.</description>

      <title>Design framework for programmable three-dimensional woven metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials have continued to offer unprecedented tunability in mechanical properties, but most designs to date have prioritized attaining high stiffness and strength while sacrificing deformability. The emergence of woven lattices-three-dimensional networks of entangled fibers-has introduced a pathway to the largely overlooked compliant and stretchable regime of metamaterials. However, the design and implementation of these complex architectures has remained a primarily manual process, restricting identification and validation of their full achievable design and property space. Here, we present a geometric design framework that encodes woven topology using a graph structure, enabling the creation of woven lattices with tunable architectures, functional gradients, and arbitrary heterogeneity. Through use of microscale in situ tension experiments and computational mechanics models, we reveal highly tunable anisotropic stiffness (varying by over an order of magnitude) and extreme stretchability (up to a stretch of four) within the design space produced by the framework. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of woven metamaterials to exhibit programmable failure patterns by leveraging tunability in the design process. This framework provides a design and modeling toolbox to access this previously unattainable high-compliance regime of mechanical metamaterials, enabling programmable large-deformation, nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature anomalies in one-dimensional exactly solvable fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous experiments and numerical simulations have revealed that a limited number of two- and three-dimensional particle systems contract in volume upon heating isobarically. This anomalous phenomenon is known as negative thermal expansion (NTE). The present paper focuses on the possibility of NTE in exactly solvable one-dimensional fluids. Firstly, the quantization of classical pure hard rods (free of NTE) does not induce NTE which indicates an unimportant role of quantum mechanics in the topic. Secondly, the classical hard rods with various types of soft nearest-neighbor interactions that contain a basin of attraction with only one minimum are investigated. The ground-state analysis reveals that, for certain potentials, increasing the pressure can lead to a discontinuous jump in the mean spacing between particles. The low-temperature analysis of the exact equation of state indicates that the NTE anomaly is present if the curvature of the soft potential increases with the distance between particles or if the potential exhibits a singularity within the basin of attraction. Isotherms of the compressibility factor, which measures the deviation of the thermodynamic behavior of a real gas from that of an ideal gas, demonstrate typical plateau or double-plateau shapes in large intervals of particle density.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Cost of Recurrent Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of a time-varying external harmonic trap whereby the trap stiffness is changed from an initial to a final value in finite-time and then the system is reset when it relaxes to an equilibrium distribution in the final trap. Such setups are very similar to those studied in the context of the finite-time Landauer erasure principle. We analyze the thermodynamic costs of such a setup by deriving a moment generating function for the work cost of recurrently changing the trap stiffness in finite-time, thereby maintaining a non-equilibrium steady state. We analyze the mean and variance of the work required for a specific experimentally viable protocol and also obtain an optimal protocol which minimizes the mean cost. For both these procedures, our analysis captures both the large-time and short-time corrections. For the optimal protocol, we obtain a closed form expression for the mean cost for all protocol durations, thereby making contact with earlier work on geometric measures of dissipation-minimizing optimal protocols that implement information erasure.</description>
