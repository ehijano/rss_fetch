      <title>Emergent synchrony in oscillator networks with adaptive arbitrary-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of complex systems are often driven by interactions that extend beyond pairwise links, underscoring the need to establish a correspondence between interpretable system parameters and emergent phenomena in hypergraph-based networks. The current work formulates an adaptive Kuramoto model that incorporates hyperedges of arbitrary order and explores their effects on synchronization. By deriving the exact order parameter dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, analytical expressions governing the collective dynamics are obtained. Subsequent numerics confirm the analytical predictions, in addition to capturing qualitatively different dynamical regimes and phase transitions. Further investigations based on order parameter distributions demonstrate how fluctuations, arising due to finite system size, can influence the long-term system dynamics. These results provide important insights and can have diverse applications, such as designing optimal surgical procedures for drug-resistant epilepsy and identifying the sources of rumours in a social network.</description>

      <title>Spatial Selection and the Multiscale Dynamics of Urban Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growth is a multi-layered phenomenon in human societies, composed of socioeconomic and demographic change at many different scales. Yet, standard macroeconomic indicators average over most of these processes, blurring the spatial and hierarchical heterogeneity driving people's choices and experiences. To address this gap, we introduce here a framework based on the Price equation to decompose aggregate growth exactly into endogenous and selection effects across nested spatial scales. We illustrate this approach with population and income data from the Chicago metropolitan area (2014-2019) and show that both growth rates and spatial selection effects are most intense at local levels, fat-tailed and spatially correlated. We also find that selection, defined as the covariance between prevailing income and relative population change, is concentrated in few spatial units and exhibits scaling behavior when grouped by county. Despite the intensity of local sorting, selection effects largely cancel in the aggregate, implying that fast heterogeneous micro-dynamics can yield deceptively stable macro-trends. By treating local spatial units (neighborhoods) as evolving subpopulations under selection, we demonstrate how methods from complex systems provide new tools to classify residential selection processes, such as abandonment and gentrification, in an urban sociological framework. This approach is general and applies to any other nested economic systems such as networks of production, occupations, or innovation enabling a new mechanistic understanding of compositional change and growth across scales of organization.</description>

      <title>Non-randomness of Japan megaquakes implied by stress recovery and accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring stress recovery and accumulation associated with megaquakes helps to assess their recurrence. Previous studies proposed a high likelihood of imminent recurrence for the 2011 Tohoku and the 17th-century Hokkaido megaquakes belonging to the magnitude-9 class, although their current stress state remains uncertain. Here we compare the occurrence of small earthquakes relative to larger ones, using b-values, showing high b-values in the source area of the Tohoku earthquake, indicating low stresses. In contrast, low b-values occurred in the source area of the 17th-century earthquake, indicating high stresses as seen before the Tohoku event. Around the low-b-value zone, phenomena that provide insight into subsequent large earthquakes are observed, and which were reported for worldwide earthquakes: seismic quiescence, a seismic gap, strong plate coupling, and slow earthquake activity avoiding megaquakes' rupture zones. Results imply that the Hokkaido and Tohoku megaquakes occur nonrandomly in time, rather their recurrence intervals are more characteristic.</description>
