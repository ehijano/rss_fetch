      <title>Jack combinatorics of the equivariant edge measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equivariant edge measure: a measure on partitions which arises implicitly in the edge term in the localization computation of the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a toric threefold. We combinatorially show that the equivariant edge measure is, up to choices of convention, equal to the Jack-Plancherel measure.</description>

      <title>On a combinatorial puzzle arising from the theory of Lascoux polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lascoux polynomials are a class of nonhomogeneous polynomials which form a basis of the full polynomial ring. Recently, Pan and Yu showed that Lascoux polynomials can be defined as generating polynomials for certain collections of diagrams consisting of unit cells arranged in the first quadrant generated from an associated ``key diagram" by applying sequences of ``$K$-Kohnert moves". Within diagrams generated in this manner, certain cells are designated as special and referred to as ``ghost cells". Given a fixed Lascoux polynomial, Pan and Yu established a combinatorial algorithm in terms of ``snow diagrams" for computing the maximum number of ghost cells occurring in a diagram defining a monomial of the given polynomial; having this value allows for one to determine the total degree of the given Lascoux polynomial. In this paper, we study the combinatorial puzzle which arises when one replaces key diagrams by arbitrary diagrams in the definition of Lascoux polynomials. Specifically, given an arbitrary diagram, we consider the question of determining the maximum number of ghost cells contained within a diagram among those formed from our given initial one by applying sequences of $K$-Kohnert moves. In this regard, we establish means of computing the aforementioned max ghost cell value for various families of diagrams as well as for diagrams in general when one takes a greedy approach.</description>

      <title>Second largest maximal cliques in small Paley graphs of square order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a conjecture that the second largest maximal cliques in Paley graphs of square order $P(q^2)$ have size $\frac{q+\epsilon}{2}$, where $q \equiv \epsilon \pmod 4$, and split into two orbits under the full group of automorphisms whenever $q \ge 25$ (a symmetric description for these two orbits is known). However, some extra second largest maximal cliques (of this size) exist in $P(q^2)$ whenever $q \in \{9,11,13,17,19,23\}$. In this paper we analyse the algebraic and geometric structure of the extra cliques.</description>

      <title>Signed magic arrays: existence and constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m,n,s,k$ be four integers such that $1\leqslant s \leqslant n$, $1\leqslant k\leqslant m$ and $ms=nk$. A signed magic array $SMA(m,n; s,k)$ is an $m\times n$ partially filled array whose entries belong to the subset $\Omega\subset \mathbb{Z}$, where $\Omega=\{0,\pm 1, \pm 2,\ldots, \pm (nk-1)/2\}$ if $nk$ is odd and $\Omega=\{\pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots, \pm nk/2\}$ if $nk$ is even, satisfying the following requirements: $(a)$ every $\omega \in \Omega$ appears once in the array; $(b)$ each row contains exactly $s$ filled cells and each column contains exactly $k$ filled cells; $(c)$ the sum of the elements in each row and in each column is $0$. In this paper we construct these arrays when $n$ is even and $s,k\geqslant 5$ are odd coprime integers. This allows us to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an $SMA(m,n; s,k)$ for all admissible values of $m,n,s,k$.</description>

      <title>Ovoids in the cyclic presentation of $PG(3,q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cyclic presentation of $PG(3,q)$ whose points are in the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^4}$ and describe the known ovoids therein. We revisit the set $\mathcal{O}$, consisting of $(q^2+1)$-th roots of unity in $\mathbb{F}_{q^4}$, and prove that it forms an elliptic quadric within the cyclic presentation of $PG(3,q)$. Additionally, following the work of Glauberman on Suzuki groups, we offer a new description of Suzuki-Tits ovoids in the cyclic presentation of $PG(3,q)$, characterizing them as the zeroes of a polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_{q^4}$.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric Functions of Random Matrices and Quasimodular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergeometric functions of complex matrices were introduced by James in multivariate statistics. These special functions play many roles in random matrix theory. The main goal of this paper is to suggest a new use for them as holomorphic observables of the Circular Unitary Ensemble. We analyze the high-dimensional behavior of the expected derivatives of these random analytic functions, and show that they admit asymptotic expansions which can be described in terms of quasimodular forms, giving an apparently new connection between the CUE and number theory.</description>

      <title>Multipartite tournaments in which any two vertices have an $(i,j)$-step common out-neighbor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a digraph $D$ is $(i,j)$-step competitive if any two vertices have an $(i,j)$-step common out-neighbor in $D$ and that a graph $G$ is $(i,j)$-step competitively orientable if there exists an $(i,j)$-step competitive orientation of $G$.
  In [Choi et al. Competitively orientable complete multipartite graphs. Discrete Mathematics, 345(9):112950, 2022], Choi et al. introduce the notion of competitive digraph and completely characterize competitively orientable complete multipartite graphs in terms of the sizes of its partite sets. Here, a competitive digraph means a $(1,1)$-step competitive digraph. In this paper, the result of Choi et al. has been extended to a general characterization of $(i,j)$-step competitively orientable complete multipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Non-conflicting no-where zero $Z_2\times Z_2$ flows in cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Z_2\times Z_2=\{0, \alpha, \beta, \alpha+\beta\}$. If $G$ is a bridgeless cubic graph, $F$ is a perfect matching of $G$ and $\overline{F}$ is the complementary 2-factor of $F$, then a no-where zero $Z_2\times Z_2$-flow $\theta$ of $G/\overline{F}$ is called non-conflicting with respect to $\overline{F}$, if $\overline{F}$ contains no edge $e=uv$, such that $u$ is incident to an edge with $\theta$-value $\alpha$ and $v$ is incident to an edge with $\theta$-value $\beta$. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of non-conflicting flows by showing that if a cubic graph $G$ admits such a flow with respect to some perfect matching $F$, then $G$ admits a normal 6-edge-coloring. We use this observation in order to show that claw-free bridgeless cubic graphs, bridgeless cubic graphs possessing a 2-factor having at most two cycles admit a normal 6-edge-coloring. We demonstrate the usefulness of non-conflicting flows further by relating them to a recent conjecture of Thomassen about edge-disjoint perfect matchings in highly connected regular graphs. In the end of the paper, we construct infinitely many 2-edge-connected cubic graphs such that $G/\overline{F}$ does not admit a non-conflicting no-where zero $Z_2\times Z_2$-flow with respect to any perfect matching $F$.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues, edge-disjoint perfect matchings and toughness of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected $d$-regular graph of order $n$, where $d\geq3$. Let $\lambda_{2}(G)$ be the second largest eigenvalue of $G$. For even $n$, we show that $G$ contains $\left\lfloor\frac{2}{3}(d-\lambda_{2}(G))\right\rfloor$ edge-disjoint perfect matchings. This improves a result stated by Cioab\u{a}, Gregory and Haemers \cite{CGH}. Let $t(G)$ be the toughness of $G$. When $G$ is non-bipartite, we give a sharp upper bound of $\lambda_{2}(G)$ to guarantee that $t(G)&gt;1$. This enriches the previous results on this direction.</description>

      <title>Spanning disks in triangulations of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a triangulation $G$ of a surface $\mathbb{D}$, a spanning disk is a disk $\mathbb{D} \subseteq \mathbb{S}$ containing all the vertices of $G$ such that the boundary of $\mathbb{D}$ is a cycle of $G$. In this paper, we consider the question of when a triangulation of a surface contains a spanning disk. We give a very short proof that every triangulation of the torus contains a spanning disk, which strengthens a theorem of Nevo and Tarabykin. For arbitrary surfaces, we prove that triangulations with sufficiently high facewidth always contain spanning disks. Finally, we exhibit triangulations which do not have spanning disks. This shows that a minimum facewidth condition is necessary. Our results are motivated by and have applications for rigidity questions in the plane.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable immersions of 4- and $f(t)$-edge-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that every sufficiently large 4-edge-connected graph contains the double cycle, $C_{2,r}$, as an immersion. In proving this, we develop a new tool we call a ring-decomposition. We also prove that linear edge-connectivity implies the presence of a $C_{t,r}$ immersion in a sufficiently large graph, where $C_{t,r}$ denotes the graph obtained from a cycle on $r$ vertices by adding $(t-1)$ edges in parallel to each existing edge; this result is an edge-analogue of a result of B\"{o}hme, Kawarabayashi, Maharry, and Mojar. We then use the latter result to provide an unavoidable minor theorem for highly connected line graphs.</description>

      <title>Brushing Directed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brushing of graphs is a graph searching process in which the searching agents are called brushes. We focus on brushing directed graphs based on a new model in which the brushes can only travel in the same direction as the orientation of the arcs that they traverse. We discuss strategies to brush directed graphs as well as values and bounds for the brushing number of directed graphs. We determine the brushing number for any transitive tournament, which we use to give an upper bound for the brushing number of directed acyclic graphs in general. We also establish exact values for the brushing numbers of complete directed graphs, rooted trees, and rotational tournaments.</description>

      <title>Partition density, star arboricity, and sums of Laplacian eigenvalues of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph on $n$ vertices, and let $\lambda_1(L(G))\ge \cdots\ge \lambda_{n-1}(L(G))\ge \lambda_n(L(G))=0$ be the eigenvalues of its Laplacian matrix $L(G)$. Brouwer conjectured that for every $1\le k\le n$, $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(L(G)) \le |E|+\binom{k+1}{2}$. Here, we prove the following weak version of Brouwer's conjecture: For every $1\leq k \leq n$, \[
  \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(L(G)) \leq
  |E|+k^2+15k\log{k}+65k. \] For a graph $G=(V,E)$, we define its partition density $\tilde{\rho}(G)$ as the maximum, over all subgraphs $H$ of $G$, of the ratio between the number of edges of $H$ and the number of vertices in the largest connected component of $H$. Our argument relies on the study of the structure of the graphs $G$ satisfying $\tilde{\rho}(G)&lt; k$. In particular, using a result of Alon, McDiarmid and Reed, we show that every such graph can be decomposed into at most $k+ 15\log{k}+65$ edge-disjoint star forests (that is, forests whose connected components are all isomorphic to stars).
  In addition, we show that for every graph $G=(V,E)$ and every $1\le k\le |V|$, \[
  \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(L(G)) \leq
  |E|+k\cdot \nu(G) + \left\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\right\rfloor, \] where $\nu(G)$ is the maximum size of a matching in $G$.</description>

      <title>Forbidden induced subgraphs in iterative higher order line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple finite connected graph. The line graph $L(G)$ of graph $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the edges of $G$, where $ef \in E(L(G))$ when $e \cap f \neq \emptyset$. Iteratively, the higher order line graphs are defined inductively as $L^1(G) = L(G)$ and $L^n(G) = L(L^{n-1}(G))$ for $n \geq 2$. In [Derived graphs and digraphs, Beitrage zur Graphentheorie (Teubner, Leipzig 1968), 17--33 (1968)], Beineke characterize line graphs in terms of nine forbidden subgraphs. Inspired by this result, in this paper, we characterize second order line graphs in terms of pure forbidden induced subgraphs. We also give a sufficient list of forbidden subgraphs for a graph $G$ such that $G$ is a higher order line graph. We characterize all order line graphs of graph $G$ with $\Delta(G) = 3$ and $4$.</description>

      <title>A New Symmetric Function Identity With an Application to symmetric group character values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric functions show up in several areas of mathematics including enumerative combinatorics and representation theory. Tewodros Amdeberhan conjectures equalities of $\Sigma_n$ characters sums over a new set called $Ev(\lambda)$. When investigating the alternating sum of characters for $Ev(\lambda)$ written in terms of the inner product of Schur functions and power sum symmetric functions, we found an equality between the alternating sum of power sum symmetric polynomials and a product of monomial symmetric polynomials. As a consequence, a special case of an alternating sum of $\Sigma_n$ characters over the set $Ev(\lambda)$ equals $0$.</description>

      <title>A lift of chromatic symmetric functions to $\textsf{NSym}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If we consider previously introduced extensions of Stanley's chromatic symmetric function $X_{G}(x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ for a graph $G$ to elements in the algebra $\textsf{QSym}$ of quasisymmetric functions and in the algebra $\textsf{NCSym}$ of symmetric functions in noncommuting variables, this motivates our introduction of a lifting of $X_{G}$ to the dual of $\textsf{QSym}$, i.e., the algebra $\textsf{NSym}$ of noncommutative symmetric functions, as opposed to $\textsf{NCSym}$. For an unlabelled directed graph $D$, our extension of chromatic symmetric functions provides an element $\text{{X}}_{D}$ in $\textsf{NSym}$, in contrast to the analogue $Y_{G} \in \textsf{NCSym}$ of $X_{G}$ due to Gebhard and Sagan. Letting $G$ denote the undirected graph underlying $D$, our construction is such that the commutative image of $\text{{X}}_{D}$ is $ X_{G}$. This projection property is achieved by lifting Stanley's power sum expansion for chromatic symmetric functions, with the use of the $\Psi$-basis of $\textsf{NSym}$, so that the orderings of the entries of the indexing compositions are determined by the directed edges of $D$. We then construct generating sets for $\textsf{NSym}$ consisting of expressions of the form $\text{{X}}_{D}$, building on the work of Cho and van Willigenburg on chromatic generating sets for $\textsf{Sym}$.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the number of cliques in a graph of given degree sequence $\ell^p$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $1 \le p \le \infty$. For a simple graph $G$ with a vertex-degree sequence $d_1, \dots, d_n$ satisfying $(d_1^p + \dots + d_n^p)^{1/p} \le C$, we prove asymptotically sharp upper bounds on the number of $t$-cliques in $G$. This result bridges the $p = 1$ case, which is equivalent to the notable Kruskal--Katona theorem, and the $p = \infty$ case, known as the Gan--Loh--Sudakov conjecture, and resolved by Chase. In particular, we demonstrate that the extremal construction exhibits a dichotomy between a single clique and multiple cliques at $p_0 = t - 1$. Our proof employs techniques from information theory, specifically the entropy method, as well as Stirling numbers from enumerative combinatorics.</description>

      <title>The extended irregular domination problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new domination problem strongly related to the following one recently proposed by Broe, Chartrand and Zhang. One says that a vertex $v$ of a graph $\Gamma$ labeled with an integer $\ell$ dominates the vertices of $\Gamma$ having distance $\ell$ from $v$. An irregular dominating set of a given graph $\Gamma$ is a set $S$ of vertices of $\Gamma$, having distinct positive labels, whose elements dominate every vertex of $\Gamma$. Since it has been proven that no connected vertex transitive graph admits an irregular dominating set, here we introduce the concept of an extended irregular dominating set, where we admit that precisely one vertex, labeled with 0, dominates itself. Then we present existence or non existence results of an extended irregular dominating set $S$ for several classes of graphs, focusing in particular on the case in which $S$ is as small as possible. We also propose two conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Set-valued standard Young tableaux are a generalization of standard Young tableaux due to Buch (2002) with applications in algebraic geometry. The enumeration of set-valued SYT is significantly more complicated than in the ordinary case, although product formulas are known in certain special cases. In this work we study the case of two-rowed set-valued SYT with a fixed number of entries. These tableaux are a new combinatorial model for the Catalan, Narayana, and Kreweras numbers, and can be shown to be in correspondence with both 321-avoiding permutations and a certain class of bicolored Motzkin paths. We also introduce a generalization of the set-valued comajor index studied by Hopkins, Lazar, and Linusson (2023), and use this statistic to find seemingly new q-analogs of the Catalan and Narayana numbers.</description>

      <title>On graphs which have locally complete 2-edge-colourings and their relationship to proper circular-arc graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2-edge-coloured graph $G$ is called {\bf locally complete} if for each vertex $v$, the vertices adjacent to $v$ through edges of the same colour induce a complete subgraph in $G$. Locally complete 2-edge-coloured graphs have nice properties and there exists a polynomial algorithm to decide whether such a graph has an alternating hamiltonian cycle, where alternating means that the colour of two consecutive edges on the cycle are different. In this paper we show that graphs having locally complete 2-edge-colourings can be recognized in polynomial time. We give a forbidden substructure characterization for this class of graphs analogous to Gallai's characterization for cocomparability graphs. Finally, we characterize proper interval graphs and proper circular-arc graphs which have locally complete 2-edge-colourings by forbidden subgraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wiener index of a graph is the sum of all the distances between any pair of vertices. We aim to describe graphs which minimize the Wiener index among all unicyclic graphs with fixed girth and given degree sequence. Depending on where the centroid of the graph is, we will present three candidates for the minimization, namely the greedy unicyclic graph, the cycle-centered graph and the out-greedy unicyclic graph.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Polyhedra of Piecewise Linear Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we contribute to the frequently studied question of how to decompose a continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function into a difference of two convex CPWL functions. Every CPWL function has infinitely many such decompositions, but for applications in optimization and neural network theory, it is crucial to find decompositions with as few linear pieces as possible. This is a highly challenging problem, as we further demonstrate by disproving a recently proposed approach by Tran and Wang [Minimal representations of tropical rational functions. Algebraic Statistics, 15(1):27-59, 2024]. To make the problem more tractable, we propose to fix an underlying polyhedral complex determining the possible locus of nonlinearity. Under this assumption, we prove that the set of decompositions forms a polyhedron that arises as intersection of two translated cones. We prove that irreducible decompositions correspond to the bounded faces of this polyhedron and minimal solutions must be vertices. We then identify cases with a unique minimal decomposition, and illustrate how our insights have consequences in the theory of submodular functions. Finally, we improve upon previous constructions of neural networks for a given convex CPWL function and apply our framework to obtain results in the nonconvex case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of weak tiling was a key ingredient in the proof of Fuglede's spectral set conjecture for convex bodies \cite{conv}, due to the fact that every spectral set tiles its complement weakly with a suitable Borel measure. In this paper we review the concept of weak tiling, and answer a question raised in \cite{weak} by giving an example of a set $T$ which tiles its complement weakly, but $T$ is neither spectral, nor a proper tile.</description>

      <title>A tower lower bound for the degree relaxation of the Regularity Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that if $(A,B)$ is an $\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}$-regular pair (in the sense of Szemer\'edi) then there exist sets $A'\subset A$ and $B'\subset B'$ with $|A'|\leq \varepsilon|A|$ and $|B'|\leq \varepsilon|B|$ so that the degrees of all vertices in $A\setminus A'$ differ by at most $\varepsilon|B|$ and the degrees of all vertices in $B\setminus B'$ differ by at most $\varepsilon|A|$. We call such a property "$\varepsilon$-degularity". This leads to the notion of an "$\varepsilon$-degular" partition of a graph in the same way as the definition of $\varepsilon$-regular pairs leads to the notion of $\varepsilon$-regular partitions. We show that there exist graphs in which any $\varepsilon$-degular partition requires the number of clusters to be $\mathrm{tower}(\Theta(\varepsilon^{-1/3}))$. That is, even though degularity is a substantial relaxation of regularity, in general one cannot improve much on the bounds that come with Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma.</description>

Abstract: We extend the chain algebra of a finite distributive lattice introduced in \cite{GN} to that of a finite pure poset. We prove that such an algebra is also normal and then present an explicit description of its canonical module. Additionally, we provide a formula for its Krull dimension, thereby extending one of main results of \cite{GN}. For a pure poset $P$ of width 2, we compute the regularity of the chain algebra of $P$ and describe the conditions under which it is either Gorenstein or nearly Gorenstein.</description>

      <title>Some line and conic arrangements and their Waldschmidt constants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Waldschmidt constant of some configurations in the projective plane. In the first part, we show that the Waldschmidt constant of a set $\mathbb{X}$ of $n$ points where at least $n-3$ points among them lie on a line is either equal to $1, \frac{2n-3}{n-1}, 2, \frac{16}{7}, \frac{7}{3}, \frac{17}{7},$ or $\frac{5}{2}$. Together with the Hilbert polynomials, this gives a complete geometric characterization for $\mathbb{X}$. Next, we study some specific configurations whose Waldschmidt constants are bounded from above by $\frac{5}{2}$. Under this condition, we describe all configurations of $n$ points with $n-1$ points among them lying on an irreducible conic, and we also study some specific configurations of $9$ points.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic normality arising in Baxter permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baxter permutations arose in the study of fixed points of the composite of commuting functions by Glen Baxter in 1964. This type of permutations are counted by Baxter numbers $B_n$. It turns out that $B_n$ enumerate a lot of discrete objects such as the bases for subalgebras of the Malvenuto-Reutenauer Hopf algebra, the pairs of twin binary trees on $n$ nodes, or the diagonal rectangulations of an $n\times n$ grid. The refined Baxter number $D_{n,k}$ also count many interesting objects including the Baxter permutations of $n$ with $k-1$ descents and $n-k$ rises, twin pairs of binary trees with $k$ left leaves and $n-k+1$ right leaves, or plane bipolar orientations with $k+1$ faces and $n-k+2$ vertices. In this paper, we obtain the asymptotic normality of the refined Baxter number $D_{n,k}$ by using a sufficient condition due to Bender. In the course of our proof, the computation involving $B_n$ and some related numbers is crucial, while $B_n$ has no closed form which make the computation untractable. To address this problem, we employ the method of asymptotics of the solutions of linear recurrence equations. Our proof is semi-automatic. All the asymptotic expansions and recurrence relations are proved by utilizing symbolic computation packages.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by colouring minimal Cayley graphs, in 1978, Babai conjectured that no-lonely-colour graphs have bounded chromatic number. We disprove this in a strong sense by constructing graphs of arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number that have a proper edge-colouring in which each cycle contains no colour exactly once.</description>

      <title>K-Independent Boolean Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new parameter for studying Boolean networks: the independence number. We establish that a Boolean network is $k$-independent if, for any set of $k$ variables and any combination of binary values assigned to them, there exists at least one fixed point in the network that takes those values at the given set of $k$ indices. In this context, we define the independence number of a network as the maximum value of $k$ such that the network is $k$-independent. This definition is closely related to widely studied combinatorial designs, such as "$k$-strength covering arrays", also known as Boolean sets with all $k$-projections surjective. Our motivation arises from understanding the relationship between a network's interaction graph and its fixed points, which deepens the classical paradigm of research in this direction by incorporating a particular structure on the set of fixed points, beyond merely observing their quantity. Specifically, among the results of this paper, we highlight a condition on the in-degree of the interaction graph for a network to be $k$-independent, we show that all regulatory networks are at most $n/2$-independent, and we construct $k$-independent networks for all possible $k$ in the case of monotone networks with a complete interaction graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the central topics in extremal graph theory is the study of the function $ex(n,H)$, which represents the maximum number of edges a graph with $n$ vertices can have while avoiding a fixed graph $H$ as a subgraph. Tur{\'a}n provided a complete characterization for the case when $H$ is a complete graph on $r$ vertices. Erd{\H o}s, Stone, and Simonovits extended Tur{\'a}n's result to arbitrary graphs $H$ with $\chi(H) &gt; 2$ (chromatic number greater than 2). However, determining the asymptotics of $ex(n, H)$ for bipartite graphs $H$ remains a widely open problem. A classical example of this is Zarankiewicz's problem, which asks for the asymptotics of $ex(n, K_{t,t})$. In this paper, we survey Zarankiewicz's problem, with a focus on graphs that arise from geometry. Incidence geometry, in particular, can be viewed as a manifestation of Zarankiewicz's problem in geometrically defined graphs.</description>

      <title>Primes of the form $p^2 + nq^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $n$ is $0$ or $4$ modulo $6$. We show that there are infinitely many primes of the form $p^2 + nq^2$ with both $p$ and $q$ prime, and obtain an asymptotic for their number. In particular, when $n = 4$ we verify the `Gaussian primes conjecture' of Friedlander and Iwaniec.
  We study the problem using the method of Type I/II sums in the number field $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{-n})$. The main innovation is in the treatment of the Type II sums, where we make heavy use of two recent developments in the theory of Gowers norms in additive combinatorics: quantitative versions of so-called concatenation theorems, due to Kuca and to Kuca--Kravitz-Leng, and the quasipolynomial inverse theorem of Leng, Sah and the second author.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>

Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in any normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'{e} constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'{e} constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call long range expansion, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends polynomially on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Log-Concave Sequences in Coding Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of logarithmically concave (or log-concave) sequences in Coding Theory. A sequence $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n$ of real numbers is called log-concave if $a_i^2 \ge a_{i-1}a_{i+1}$ for all $1 \le i \le n-1$. A natural sequence of positive numbers in coding theory is the weight distribution of a linear code consisting of the nonzero values among $A_i$'s where $A_i$ denotes the number of codewords of weight $i$. We call a linear code log-concave if its nonzero weight distribution is log-concave. Our main contribution is to show that all binary general Hamming codes of length $2^r -1$ ($r=3$ or $r \ge 5$), the binary extended Hamming codes of length $2^r ~(r \ge 3)$, and the second order Reed-Muller codes $R(2, m)~ (m \ge 2)$ are all log-concave while the homogeneous and projective second order Reed-Muller codes are either log-concave, or 1-gap log-concave. Furthermore, we show that any MDS $[n, k]$ code over $\mathbb F_q$ satisfying $3 \leqslant k \leqslant n/2 +3$ is log-concave if $q \geqslant q_0(n, k)$ which is the larger root of a quadratic polynomial. Hence, we expect that the concept of log-concavity in coding theory will stimulate many interesting problems.</description>

Abstract: Ron Graham's Sequence is a surprising bijection from non-negative integers to non-negative, non-prime integers that was introduced by Ron Graham in the June 1986 "Problems" column of $\textit{Mathematics Magazine}$, and which later appeared in Problem A2 of the 2013 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. We describe some properties of this function, give an algorithm for computing its values in pseudo-polynomial time, and prove a 22 year-old conjecture about an upper bound for the function.</description>

      <title>Complexity results for a cops and robber game on directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a cops and robber game on directed graphs, where the robber moves along the arcs of the graph, while the cops can select any position at each time step. Our main focus is on the cop number: the minimum number of cops required to guarantee the capture of the robber. We prove that deciding whether the cop number of a digraph is equal to 1 is NP-hard, whereas this is decidable in polynomial time for tournaments. Furthermore, we show that computing the cop number for general digraphs is fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by a generalization of vertex cover. However, for tournaments, tractability is achieved with respect to the minimum size of a feedback vertex set. Among our findings, we prove that the cop number of a digraph is equal to that of its reverse digraph, and we draw connections to the matrix mortality problem.</description>

      <title>Canonical Landau-Ginzburg models for cominuscule homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a type-independent Landau-Ginzburg (LG) model $(X_\mathrm{can}, \mathcal{W}_\mathrm{can})$ for any cominuscule homogeneous space $X=G/P$. We give a fully combinatorial construction for our superpotential $\mathcal{W}_\mathrm{can}$ as a sum of $n+1$ rational functions in the (generalized) Pl\"ucker coordinates on the "Langlands dual" minuscule homogeneous space $\mathbb{X}=P^\vee\backslash G^\vee$. Explicitly, we define the denominators $\mathcal{D}_{i_*}$ of these rational functions using the combinatorics of order ideals of the corresponding minuscule poset, which can be interpreted as (generalized) Young diagrams, by a process that can be described by "moving boxes" and hence is easily implemented. To construct the corresponding numerators, we define derivations $\delta_{i_1}$ on $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{X}]$ that act by "adding an appropriate box if possible" and then we apply each $\delta_{i_1}$ to the corresponding $\mathcal{D}_{i_*}$. By studying certain Weyl orbits in the fundamental representations of $\widetilde{G}^\vee$ and exploiting the existence of a certain dense algebraic torus in $\mathbb{X}$, we show that the polynomials $\mathcal{D}_{i_*}$ coincide with the generalized minors $\phi_{i_*}$ appearing in the cluster structures for homogeneous spaces studied by Gei\ss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer in arXiv:math/0609138. We then define the mirror variety $X_\mathrm{can}=\mathbb{X}\setminus D_\mathrm{ac}$ to be the complement of the anticanonical divisor $D_\mathrm{ac} = \sum_{i_*}\{\mathcal{D}_{i_*}=0\}$ formed by the $\mathcal{D}_{i_*}$. Moreover, we show that the LG models $(X_\mathrm{can},\mathcal{W}_\mathrm{can})$ are isomorphic to the Lie-theoretic LG-models $(X_\mathrm{Lie},\mathcal{W}_\mathrm{Lie})$ constructed by Rietsch in arXiv:math/0511124 and our models naturally generalize the type-dependent Pl\"ucker coordinate LG-models previously studied by various authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.08118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain a new curious identity involving trigonometric functions. Namely, for any positive odd integer $n$ we prove that $$\sum_{k=1}^n(-1)^k(\cot kx)\sin k(n-k)x=\frac{1-n}2,$$ which is equivalent to the identity $$\sum_{k=1}^n(-1)^kU_{n-k}(\cos kx)=-\frac{n+1}2,$$ where $U_m(z)$ stands for the $m$th Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind. As a consequence, for any positive odd integer $n$ and positive integer $m$ we obtain $$\sum_{k=1}^n(-1)^kk^{2m}B_{2m+1}\left(\frac{n-k}2\right)=0,$$ where $B_j(x)$ denotes the Bernoulli polynomial of degree $j$.</description>

We also show a construction of a planar subcubic graph of girth 11 that is not $2$-distance $4$-colorable.</description>

      <title>$2$-polarity and algorithmic aspects of polarity variants on cograph superclasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02497v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be an $(s, k)$-polar graph if its vertex set admits a partition $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ induce, respectively, a complete $s$-partite graph and the disjoint union of at most $k$ complete graphs. Polar graphs and monopolar graphs are defined as $(\infty, \infty)$- and $(1, \infty)$-polar graphs, respectively, and unipolar graphs are those graphs with a polar partition $(A, B)$ such that $A$ is a clique.
  The problems of deciding whether an arbitrary graph is a polar graph or a monopolar graph are known to be NP-complete. In contrast, deciding whether a graph is a unipolar graph can be done in polynomial time. In this work we prove that the three previous problems can be solved in linear time on the classes of $P_4$-sparse and $P_4$-extendible graphs, generalizing analogous results previously known for cographs.
  Additionally, we provide finite forbidden subgraph characterizations for $(2,2)$-polar graphs on $P_4$-sparse and $P_4$-extendible graphs, also generalizing analogous results recently obtained for the class of cographs.</description>

      <title>Extensions of results on phylogeny graphs of degree bounded digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An acyclic digraph in which every vertex has indegree at most $i$ and outdegree at most $j$ is called an $(i,j)$ digraph for some positive integers $i$ and $j$. The phylogeny graph of a digraph $D$ has $V(D)$ as the vertex set and an edge $uv$ if and only if one of the following is true: $(u,v) \in A(D)$; $(v,u) \in A(D)$; $(u,w) \in A(D)$ and $(v,w) \in A(D)$ for some $w \in V(D)$. A graph $G$ is a phylogeny graph (resp.\ an $(i,j)$ phylogeny graph) if there is an acyclic digraph $D$ (resp.\ an $(i,j)$ digraph $D$) such that the phylogeny graph of $D$ is isomorphic to $G$. Lee~{\em et al.} (2017) and Eoh and Kim (2021) studied the $(2,2)$ phylogeny graphs, $(1,j)$ phylogeny graphs, $(i,1)$ phylogeny graphs, and $(2,j)$ phylogeny graphs. Their work was motivated by problems related to evidence propagation in a Bayesian network for which it is useful to know which acyclic digraphs have chordal moral graphs (phylogeny graphs are called moral graphs in Bayesian network theory). In this paper, we extend their work by giving necessary conditions of chordal $(i,2)$ phylogeny graphs. We go further to give necessary conditions of $(i,j)$ phylogeny graphs by listing forbidden induced subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Finite Hypergraph Families with Rich Extremal Tur\'an Constructions via Mixing Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, for any finite set of minimal $r$-graph patterns, there is a finite family $\mathcal F$ of forbidden $r$-graphs such that the extremal Tur\'an constructions for $\mathcal F$ are precisely the maximum $r$-graphs obtainable from mixing the given patterns in any way via blowups and recursion. This extends the result by the second author \cite{PI14}, where the above statement was established for a single pattern.
  We present two applications of this result. First, we construct a finite family $\mathcal F$ of $3$-graphs such that there are exponentially many maximum $\mathcal F$-free $3$-graphs of each large order $n$ and, moreover, the corresponding Tur\'an problem is not finitely stable. Second, we show that there exists a finite family $\mathcal{F}$ of $3$-graphs whose feasible region function attains its maximum on a Cantor-type set of positive Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>The Harer-Zagier and Jackson formulas and new results for one-face bipartite maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03695v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of bipartite maps (or Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants) is closely connected with geometry, mathematical physics and free probability. Here we study these objects from their permutation factorization formulation using a novel character theory approach. We first present some general symmetric function expressions for the number of products of two permutations respectively from two arbitrary, but fixed, conjugacy classes indexed by $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ which produce a permutation with $m$ cycles. Our next objective is to derive explicit formulas for the cases where $\alpha$ corresponds to full cycles, i.e., one-face bipartite maps. We prove a far-reaching explicit formula, and show that the number for any $\gamma$ can be iteratively reduced to that of products of two full cycles, which implies an efficient dimension-reduction algorithm for building a database of all these numbers. Note that the number for products of two full cycles can be computed by the Zagier-Stanley formula. Also, in a unified way, we easily prove the celebrated Harer-Zagier formula and Jackson's formula, and we obtain explicit formulas for several new families as well.</description>

      <title>Polynomial invariants for rooted trees related to their random destruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider three bivariate polynomial invariants $P$, $A$, and $S$ for rooted trees, as well as a trivariate polynomial invariant $M$. These invariants are motivated by random destruction processes such as the random cutting model or site percolation on rooted trees. We exhibit recursion formulas for the invariants and identities relating $P$, $S$, and $M$. The main result states that the invariants $P$ and $S$ are complete, that is they distinguish rooted trees (in fact, even rooted forests) up to isomorphism. The proof method relies on the obtained recursion formulas and on irreducibility of the polynomials in suitable unique factorization domains. For $A$, we provide counterexamples showing that it is not complete, although that question remains open for the trivariate invariant $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a far-reaching generalization of Schnyder woods which encompasses many classical combinatorial structures on planar graphs.
  Schnyder woods are defined for planar triangulations as certain triples of spanning trees covering the triangulation and crossing each other in an orderly fashion. They are of theoretical and practical importance, as they are central to the proof that the order dimension of any planar graph is at most 3, and they are also underlying an elegant drawing algorithm. In this article we extend the concept of Schnyder wood well beyond its original setting: for any integer d&gt;2 we define a ``grand-Schnyder'' structure for (embedded) planar graphs which have faces of degree at most d and non-facial cycles of length at least d. We prove the existence of grand-Schnyder structures, provide a linear construction algorithm, describe 4 different incarnations (in terms of tuples of trees, corner labelings, weighted orientations, and marked orientations), and define a lattice for the set of grand Schnyder structures of a given planar graph. We show that the grand-Schnyder framework unifies and extends several classical constructions: Schnyder woods and Schnyder decompositions, regular edge-labelings (a.k.a. transversal structures), and Felsner woods.</description>

      <title>Uniquely hamiltonian graphs for many sets of degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give constructive proofs for the existence of uniquely hamiltonian graphs for various sets of degrees. We give constructions for all sets with minimum 2 (a trivial case added for completeness), all sets with minimum 3 that contain an even number (for sets without an even number it is known that no uniquely hamiltonian graphs exist), and all sets with minimum 4, except {4}, {4,5}, and {4,6}. For minimum degree 3 and 4, the constructions also give 3-connected graphs. We also introduce the concept of seeds, which makes the above results possible and might be useful in the study of Sheehan's conjecture. Furthermore, we prove that 3-connected uniquely hamiltonian 4-regular graphs exist if and only if 2-connected uniquely hamiltonian 4-regular graphs exist.</description>

      <title>On the faces of unigraphic $3$-polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.20012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $3$-polytope is a $3$-connected, planar graph. It is called unigraphic if it does not share its vertex degree sequence with any other $3$-polytope, up to graph isomorphism. The classification of unigraphic $3$-polytopes appears to be a difficult problem.
  In this paper we prove that, apart from pyramids, all unigraphic $3$-polytopes have no $n$-gonal faces for $n\geq 10$. Our method involves defining several planar graph transformations on a given $3$-polytope containing an $n$-gonal face with $n\geq 10$. The delicate part is to prove that, for every such $3$-polytope, at least one of these transformations both preserves $3$-connectivity, and is not an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Denniston partial difference sets exist in the odd prime case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denniston constructed partial difference sets (PDSs) with the parameters $(2^{3m}, (2^{m+r} - 2^m + 2^r)(2^m-1), 2^m-2^r+(2^{m+r}-2^m+2^r)(2^r-2), (2^{m+r}-2^m+2^r)(2^r-1))$ in elementary abelian groups of order $2^{3m}$ for all $m \geq 2, 1 \leq r &lt; m$. These correspond to maximal arcs in Desarguesian projective planes of even order. In this paper, we show that - although maximal arcs do not exist in Desarguesian projective planes of odd order - PDSs with the Denniston parameters $(p^{3m}, (p^{m+r} - p^m + p^r)(p^m-1), p^m-p^r+(p^{m+r}-p^m+p^r)(p^r-2), (p^{m+r}-p^m+p^r)(p^r-1))$ exist in all elementary abelian groups of order $p^{3m}$ for all $m \geq 2, r \in \{1, m-1\}$ where $p$ is an odd prime, and present a construction. Our approach uses PDSs formed as unions of cyclotomic classes.</description>

Abstract: We construct for every integer $k\geq 3$ and every real $\mu\in(0, \frac{k-1}{k})$ a set of integers $X=X(k, \mu)$ which, when coloured with finitely many colours, contains a monochromatic $k$-term arithmetic progression, whilst every finite $Y\subseteq X$ has a subset $Z\subseteq Y$ of size $|Z|\geq \mu |Y|$ that is free of arithmetic progressions of length $k$. This answers a question of Erd\H{o}s, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, and the second author. Moreover, we obtain an analogous multidimensional statement and a Hales-Jewett version of this result.</description>

      <title>A note on extremal constructions for the Erd\H{o}s--Rademacher problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For given positive integers $r\ge 3$, $n$ and $e\le \binom{n}{2}$, the famous Erd\H os--Rademacher problem asks for the minimum number of $r$-cliques in a graph with $n$ vertices and $e$ edges. A conjecture of Lov\'asz and Simonovits from the 1970s states that, for every $r\ge 3$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then, for every $e\le \binom{n}{2}$, at least one extremal graph can be obtained from a complete partite graph by adding a triangle-free graph into one part.
  In this note, we explicitly write the minimum number of $r$-cliques predicted by the above conjecture. Also, we describe what we believe to be the set of extremal graphs for any $r\ge 4$ and all large~$n$, amending the previous conjecture of Pikhurko and Razborov.</description>

      <title>Symmetric functions from the six-vertex model in half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stochastic six-vertex model in half-space with generic integrable boundary weights, and define two families of multivariate rational symmetric functions. Using commutation relations between double-row operators, we prove a skew Cauchy identity of these functions. In a certain degeneration of the right-hand side of the Cauchy identity we obtain the partition function of the six-vertex model in a half-quadrant, and give a Pfaffian formula for this quantity. The Pfaffian is a direct generalization of a formula obtained by Kuperberg in his work on symmetry classes of alternating-sign matrices. One of our families of symmetric functions admits an integral (sum over residues) formula, and we use this to conjecture an orthogonality property of the dual family. We conclude by studying the reduction of our integral formula to transition probabilities of the (initially empty) asymmetric simple exclusion process on the half-line.</description>

      <title>Complete $3$-term arithmetic progression free sets of small size in vector spaces and other abelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of an abelian group $G$ is called $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ free if it does not contain a three term arithmetic progression. Moreover, $S$ is called complete $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ free, if it is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. One of the most central problems in additive combinatorics is to determine the maximal size of a $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ free set, which is necessarily complete. In this paper we are interested in the minimum size of complete $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ free sets. We define and study saturation w.r.t. $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$s and present constructions of small complete $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ free sets and $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ saturating sets for several families of vector spaces and cyclic groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of intersection problems on families of sets is one of the most important topics in extremal combinatorics. As we all know, the extremal problems involving certain intersection constraints are equivalent to that with the union properties by taking complement of sets. A family of sets is called $s$-union if the union of any two sets in this family has size at most $s$. Katona [Acta Math. Hungar. 15 (1964)] provided the maximum size of an $s$-union family of sets of $[n]$, and he also determined the extremal families up to isomorphism. Recently, Frankl [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 122 (2017) 869--876] sharpened this result by establishing the maximum size of an $s$-union family that is not a subfamily of the so-called Katona family. In this paper, we determine the maximum size of an $s$-union family that is neither contained in the Katona family nor in the Frankl family. Moreover, we characterize all extremal families achieving the upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Generating all invertible matrices by row operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that all invertible $n \times n$ matrices over any finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ can be generated in a Gray code fashion. More specifically, there exists a listing such that (1) each matrix appears exactly once, and (2) two consecutive matrices differ by adding or subtracting one row from a previous or subsequent row, or by multiplying or diving a row by the generator of the multiplicative group of $\mathbb{F}_q$. This even holds if the addition and subtraction of each row is allowed to some specific rows satisfying a certain mild condition. Moreover, we can prescribe the first and the last matrix if $n\ge 3$, or $n=2$ and $q&gt;2$. In other words, the corresponding flip graph on all invertible $n \times n$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is Hamilton connected if it is not a cycle. This solves yet another special case of Lov\'{a}sz conjecture on Hamiltonicity of vertex-transitive graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hindman's theorem and van der Waerden's theorem are two classical Ramsey theoretic results, the first one deals with finite configurations and the second one deals with infinite configurations. The Central Sets Theorem due to Furstenberg is a strong simultaneous extension of both theorems, which also applies to general commutative semigroups. Beiglboeck provided a common extension of the Central Sets Theorem and Milliken-Taylor Theorem in commutative case. Furstenberg's original Central Sets Theorem was proved in \cite{key-2} for $\left(\mathbb{N},+\right)$ for finitely many sequences at a time. Bergelson and Hindman provided a non commutative version of this Theorem \cite{key-3}. The first author of this article jointly with Hindman and Straus provided a non-commutative version of Central Sets Theorem using arbitrary many sequence at a time \cite{key-5}. In this work we will provide a non-commutative extension of Beiglboeck's Theorem. We also provide polynomial generalization of Beiglbock's theorem.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the 4-dimensional Space with a Set of 4 Polyhypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Greenfeld and Tao disprove the conjecture that translational tilings of a single tile can always be periodic [Ann. Math. 200(2024), 301-363]. In another paper [to appear in J. Eur. Math. Soc.], they also show that if the dimension $n$ is part of the input, the translational tiling for subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with one tile is undecidable. These two results are very strong pieces of evidence for the conjecture that translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a monotile is undecidable, for some fixed $n$. This paper shows that translational tiling of the $3$-dimensional space with a set of $5$ polycubes is undecidable. By introducing a technique that lifts a set of polycubes and its tiling from $3$-dimensional space to $4$-dimensional space, we manage to show that translational tiling of the $4$-dimensional space with a set of $4$ tiles is undecidable. This is a step towards the attempt to settle the conjecture of the undecidability of translational tiling of the $n$-dimensional space with a monotile, for some fixed $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By a Christoffel matrix we mean a $n\times n$ matrix corresponding to the lexicographic array of a Christoffel word of length $n.$ If $R$ is an integral domain, then the product of two Christoffel matrices over $R$ is commutative and is a Christoffel matrix over $R.$ Furthermore, if a Christoffel matrix over $R$ is invertible, then its inverse is a Christoffel matrix over $R.$ Consequently, the set $GC_n(R)$ of all $n\times n$ invertible Christoffel matrices over $R$ forms an abelian subgroup of $GL_n(R).$ The subset of $GC_n(R)$ consisting all invertible Christoffel matrices having some element $a$ on the diagonal and $b$ elsewhere (with $a,b \in R$ distinct) forms a subgroup $H$ of $GC_n(R).$ If $R$ is a field, then the quotient $GC_n(R)/H$ is isomorphic to $(\Z/nZ)^\times,$ the multiplicative group of integers modulo $n.$ It follows from this that for each finite field $F$ and each finite abelian group $G,$ there exists $n\geq 2$ and a faithful representation $G\rightarrow GL_n(F)$ consisting entirely of $n\times n$ (invertible) Christoffel matrices over $F.$ We compute the group $GC_n(\F_2)$ and show that $GC_n(\F_2) \simeq (\Z/nZ)^\times$ for $n$ odd. We define an associative and commutative binary operation on the set of all $\{0,1\}$-Christoffel words of length $n$ which in turn induces an associative and commutative binary operation on $\{0,1\}$-central words of length $n-2.$</description>

Abstract: Using the method of the $q$-exponential differential operator, we give an extension of the Sears $_4\phi_3$ transformation formula. Based on this extended formula and a $q$-series expansion formula for an analytic function around the origin, we present a transformation formula for triple $q$-series, which includes several interesting special cases, especially a double $q$-series summation formula. Some applications of this transformation formula to Rogers-Hecke type series are discussed. More than 100 Rogers-Hecke type identities including Andrews' identities for the sums of three squares and the sums of three triangular numbers are obtained.</description>

      <title>On the Constant-Depth Circuit Complexity of Generating Quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00133v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the constant-depth circuit complexity of the Isomorphism Problem, Minimum Generating Set Problem (MGS), and Sub(quasi)group Membership Problem (Membership) for groups and quasigroups (=Latin squares), given as input in terms of their multiplication (Cayley) tables. Despite decades of research on these problems, lower bounds for these problems even against depth-$2$ AC circuits remain unknown. Perhaps surprisingly, Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, and Wagner (FSTTCS 2010; ACM Trans. Comput. Theory, 2013) showed that Quasigroup Isomorphism could be solved by AC circuits of depth $O(\log \log n)$ using $O(\log^2 n)$ nondeterministic bits, a class we denote $\exists^{\log^2(n)}FOLL$. We narrow this gap by improving the upper bound for many of these problems to $quasiAC^0$, thus decreasing the depth to constant.
  In particular, we show:
  - MGS for quasigroups is in $\exists^{\log^2(n)}\forall^{\log n}NTIME(\mathrm{polylog}(n))\subseteq quasiAC^0$. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 1996) conjectured that this problem was $\exists^{\log^2(n)}P$-complete; our results refute a version of that conjecture for completeness under $quasiAC^0$ reductions unconditionally, and under polylog-space reductions assuming EXP $\neq$ PSPACE.
  - MGS for groups is in $AC^{1}(L)$, improving on the previous upper bound of $P$ (Lucchini &amp; Thakkar, J. Algebra, 2024).
  - Quasigroup Isomorphism belongs to $\exists^{\log^2(n)}AC^0(DTISP(\mathrm{polylog},\log)\subseteq quasiAC^0$, improving on the previous bound of $\exists^{\log^2(n)}L\cap\exists^{\log^2(n)}FOLL\subseteq quasiFOLL$ (Chattopadhyay, Tor\'an, &amp; Wagner, ibid.; Levet, Australas. J. Combin., 2023).
  Our results suggest that understanding the constant-depth circuit complexity may be key to resolving the complexity of problems concerning (quasi)groups in the multiplication table model.</description>

      <title>Computing the EHZ capacity is NP-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity (EHZ capacity) is a fundamental symplectic invariant of convex bodies. We show that computing the EHZ capacity of polytopes is NP-hard. For this we reduce the feedback arc set problem in bipartite tournaments to computing the EHZ capacity of simplices.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Depth in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A characterization of the representability of neural networks is relevant to comprehend their success in artificial intelligence. This study investigate two topics on ReLU neural network expressivity and their connection with a conjecture related to the minimum depth required for representing any continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function. The topics are the minimal depth representation of the sum and max operations, as well as the exploration of polytope neural networks. For the sum operation, we establish a sufficient condition on the minimal depth of the operands to find the minimal depth of the operation. In contrast, regarding the max operation, a comprehensive set of examples is presented, demonstrating that no sufficient conditions, depending solely on the depth of the operands, would imply a minimal depth for the operation. The study also examine the minimal depth relationship between convex CPWL functions. On polytope neural networks, we investigate basic depth properties from Minkowski sums, convex hulls, number of vertices, faces, affine transformations, and indecomposable polytopes. More significant findings include depth characterization of polygons; identification of polytopes with an increasing number of vertices, exhibiting small depth and others with arbitrary large depth; and most notably, the minimal depth of simplices, which is strictly related to the minimal depth conjecture in ReLU networks.</description>

      <title>Factor Complexity of the Most Significant Digits of~$a^{n^d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate unipotent dynamics on a torus and apply these techniques to the following problem. Let \(d\) be a positive integer, and let \(a &gt; 0\) be a real number. For an integer \(b \geqslant 5\), such that \(a\) and \(b\) are multiplicatively independent, consider the sequence \((\mathbf{w}_n)\), where \(\mathbf{w}_n\) is the most significant digit of \(a^{n^d}\) when expressed in base \(b\). We prove that the complexity function of the sequence \((\mathbf{w}_n)\) is, up to finitely many exceptions, a polynomial function.</description>

      <title>Context-free graphs and their transition groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new class of groups arising from context-free inverse graphs. We provide closure properties, prove that their co-word problems are context-free, study the torsion elements, and realize them as subgroups of the asynchronous rational group. Furthermore, we use a generalized version of the free product of graphs and prove that such a product is context-free inverse closed. We also exhibit an example of a group in our class that is not residually finite and one that is not poly-context-free. These properties make them interesting candidates to disprove both the Lehnert conjecture (which characterizes co-context-free groups as all subgroups of Thompson's group V) and the Brough conjecture (which characterizes finitely generated poly-context-free groups as virtual finitely generated subgroups of direct products of free groups).</description>

      <title>SCMAlgebras: a Macaulay2 package to check sequential Cohen-Macaulayness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Macaulay2 package SCMAlgebras. It provides functions for computing the modules of deficiency and the filter ideals, in order to check whether a module or an ideal is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. After the basic algebraic notions and results are recalled, the main features of the package are described through examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We treat three cubic recurrences, two of which generalize the famous iterated map $x \mapsto x (1-x)$ from discrete chaos theory. A feature of each asymptotic series developed here is a constant, dependent on the initial condition but otherwise intrinsic to the function at hand.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Cayley graphs on non-abelian simple groups of valency 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a connected $7$-valent symmetric Cayley graph on a finite non-abelian simple group $G$. If $\Gamma$ is not normal, Li {\em et al.} [On 7-valent symmetric Cayley graphs of finite simple groups, J. Algebraic Combin. 56 (2022) 1097-1118] characterised the group pairs $(\mathrm{soc}(\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)/K),GK/K)$, where $K$ is a maximal intransitive normal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$. In this paper, we improve this result by proving that if $\Gamma$ is not normal, then $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ contains an arc-transitive non-abelian simple normal subgroup $T$ such that $G&lt;T$ and $(T,G)=(\mathrm{A}_{n},\mathrm{A}_{n-1})$ with $n=7$, $3\cdot 7$, $3^2\cdot 7$, $2^2\cdot 3\cdot 7$, $2^3\cdot3\cdot7$, $2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7$, $2^4\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7$, $2^6\cdot3\cdot7$, $2^7\cdot3\cdot7$, $2^6\cdot3^2\cdot7$, $2^6\cdot3^4\cdot5^2\cdot7$, $2^8\cdot3^4\cdot5^2\cdot7$, $2^7\cdot3^4\cdot5^2\cdot7$, $2^{10}\cdot3^2\cdot7$, $2^{24}\cdot3^2\cdot7$. Furthermore, $\mathrm{soc}(\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)/R)=(T\times R)/R$, where $R$ is the largest solvable normal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$.</description>
