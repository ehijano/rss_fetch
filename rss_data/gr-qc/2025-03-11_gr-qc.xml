      <title>Non-modal effects in black hole perturbation theory: Transient Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-modal stability of black hole spacetimes under linear perturbations. We show that large-amplitude growth can occur at finite time, despite asymptotic decay of linear perturbations. In the example presented, the physical mechanism is a transient form of superradiance, and is qualitatively similar to the transition to turbulence in Navier-Stokes shear flows. As part of the construction we provide a theorem for the positivity of QNM energies, and introduce a truncated-Hamiltonian approach to black hole pseudospectra which does not suffer from convergence issues.</description>

      <title>Shadows and optical appearance of quantum-corrected black holes illuminated by static thin accretions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two new quantum-corrected static spherically symmetric black hole models satisfying covariance have been proposed within the framework of effective quantum gravity. In this paper, we study how the quantum parameter $\zeta$ affects the optical properties of two quantum black hole models. We first analyze the photon sphere, critical impact parameter, and innermost stable circular orbit as $\zeta$ varies, and constrain $\zeta$ using Event Horizon Telescope data. Additionally, by employing the ray-tracing method to study photon trajectories near the two quantum black holes, we find that $\zeta$ can reduce the range of impact parameters corresponding to the photon ring and lensed ring. We then examine the optical appearance of these black holes with thin accretion disks, showing $\zeta$ significantly brightens the first model's image but has little effect on the second. Meanwhile, we demonstrate the contributions of the transfer functions to the observed intensity of direct and lensed ring in the observer's field of view, which has rarely been separately illustrated in previous studies. Finally, we study the optical appearance of both quantum black holes under a static spherical accretion model, with results consistent with the above. Therefore, we conclude that the second quantum black hole is almost indistinguishable from the Schwarzschild black hole, while the first quantum black hole can be distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole through its optical appearance.</description>

      <title>Divergence-free deceleration and energy conditions in non-minimal $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the divergence-free parametric form of the deceleration parameter within the simplest non-minimal matter-geometry coupling in $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Specifically, we consider the linear model $f(R,T) = R + 2\lambda T$, where $\lambda$ governs the interaction between matter and geometry. Using this parametric form, we derive the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift $z$ and incorporate it into the modified Friedmann equations. Constraining the model with OHD and Pantheon data, we obtain precise estimates for $H_0$, the present deceleration parameter $q_0$, and its evolutionary component $q_1$, confirming a smooth transition between cosmic deceleration and acceleration. Further, we analyze the evolution of the energy density $\rho$ and total EoS parameter $\omega$ for different $\lambda$ values, highlighting deviations from $\Lambda$CDM and the role of $\lambda$ in shaping cosmic dynamics. In addition, we examine energy conditions, finding that the NEC and DEC are satisfied throughout evolution, while the SEC is violated at late times, supporting the observed acceleration. Our findings demonstrate that this divergence-free parameterization within $f(R,T)$ gravity offers a viable framework for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration while maintaining key observational and theoretical constraints.</description>

      <title>Dark Sector Interactions: Probing the Hubble Parameter and the Sound Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the impact of the interacting parameter on dark matter in a model resulting from a parametrization of dark energy density. To ensure a model-independent approach, we treat \( r_d \) as a free parameter, avoiding assumptions about the physics of the early Universe or specific recombination models. This approach allows late-time cosmological observations to directly constrain \( r_d \) along with other parameters. Using recent measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1, cosmic chronometers (CC) and Pantheon\(^{+}\) supernova (SNe Ia) data, we uncover a significant effect of the interacting parameter on dark matter. Our analysis reveals that while non-interacting models attribute 68.2\% of the cosmic energy density to dark energy, interacting models increase this share to 73.4\%. To further probe these differences, we evaluate the evolution of the deceleration parameter for each model, contrasting them against the \(\Lambda\)CDM paradigm and observational data from CC and SNe Ia measurements. Finally, we apply various statistical metrics to rigorously assess the performance of these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we theoretically investigate light deflection in the weak and strong field regimes for two regular spacetimes with corrections from loop quantum gravity. We treat analytically the expansions for both limits and use them as a basis for investigating gravitational lensing observables. We analyze and provide reasonable values for observables related to the second model that observational tools may be able to detect.</description>

      <title>Harvesting correlations from BTZ black hole coupled to a Lorentz-violating vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on correlations harvesting, specifically focusing on the harvested entanglement and harvested mutual information between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in the Lorentz-violating BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that Lorentz symmetry breaking has contrasting impacts on entanglement harvesting and mutual information harvesting in BTZ backgrounds: it enhances mutual information harvesting while suppressing entanglement harvesting. This phenomenon suggests that the increase in total correlations in Lorentz-violating vector field backgrounds with gravitational coupling is predominantly driven by classical components, with quantum correlations contributing less to the overall mutual information. These results indicate that Lorentz violation, as a quantum property of spacetime, may impose intrinsic constraints on the quantum information capacity encoded in spacetime due to competition among quantum degrees of freedom for resources. Furthermore, Lorentz symmetry breaking expands the \textit{entanglement shadow} region, further demonstrating its disruptive effect on quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Scale Parameter of Regular Black Hole in Asymptotically Safe Gravity from Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the potential for constraining the quantum scale parameter $\xi$ of regular black hole within the asymptotically safe gravity framework using gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI). Since $\xi$ cannot be precisely determined from first principles, observational constraints become crucial. We employ the Augmented Analytical Kludge (AAK) method to calculate gravitational waveforms in the equatorial plane and systematically analyze the influence of different $\xi$ values on phase evolution. Comparison with the Schwarzschild case demonstrates that the corrective effects of $\xi$ accumulate in the phase over observation time, thereby providing distinguishable observational signatures. Through waveform mismatch analysis, our results indicate that the LISA detector can effectively detect the presence of $\xi$ at the $\sim10^{-4}$ level for systems with a mass of $10^6M_\odot$. Further assessment using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) confirms a measurement precision of $\Delta\xi\approx3.225\times10^{-4}$, which significantly surpasses existing observational methods, providing quantitative observational evidence for asymptotically safe quantum gravity theory in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Gauged supergravities: solutions with Killing tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform full integration of the stationary axisymmetric Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory with and without potential using a recently proposed generalization of Carter's approach to spacetimes beyond type D, allowing the Killing tensor. Crucial to our construction is a new parametrization of the dilaton and axion fields based on the analyticity argument. The general solution in the ungauged case is asymptotically locally flat and contains two more parameters compared to EMDA black holes previously obtained using Harrison transformations. In the gauged case, the general solution is asymptotically AdS and includes flat and hyperbolic topological solutions, as well as generalization of the Kerr-Sen-AdS metric with three additional parameters. Our approach can be applied to more general four-dimensional ungauged and gauged supergravities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how the gravitational field generated by a four-dimensional electrovacuum cosmological space-time influences the dynamics of fermionic fields governed by the Dirac equation, while also considering the effects of topology. We derive the radial wave equation corresponding to the relativistic Dirac equation and subsequently obtain analytical solutions for the energy levels and wave functions of the fermionic field within our chosen framework. Our analysis reveals that various parameters, including geometric topology, the cosmological constant, and quantum numbers, play significant roles in determining the eigenvalue solution of the quantum particles. Specifically, we demonstrate that the presence of the topological parameter disrupts the degeneracy of the energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum corrected black hole through astrophysical tests with the orbit of S2 star and quasiperiodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the influence of the quantum correction parameter $\xi$ on the motion of particles and the properties of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) around a quantum-corrected black hole (QCBH). We first analyze the geodesics of a test particle and derive weak-field constraints on parameter $\xi$ from the perihelion precession of orbits, using observations from the Solar System and the S2 star's orbit around $\text{SgrA}^\star$ supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy. We obtain $\xi \leq 0.01869$ and $\xi \leq 0.73528$ using the analysis of Solar System observations and the orbit of the S2 star around $\text{SgrA}^\star$, respectively. In the strong-field regime, we examine the dynamics of epicyclic motion around astrophysical black holes and, using observational data from four QPO sources and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we determine the upper constraint $\xi \leq 2.086$. Our results provide new insights into the effects of quantum corrections on black hole spacetimes and highlight the potential of QPOs as a probe for testing quantum gravity in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Pad\'e metrics for black hole perturbations and light rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most distinguishing features of black holes and their mimickers are concentrated near the horizon. In contrast, astrophysical observations and theoretical considerations primarily constrain the far-field geometry. In this work we develop tools to effectively describe both, using the two-point Pad\'e approximation to construct interpolating metrics connecting the near and far-field. We extend our previous work by computing the quasinormal modes of gravitational perturbations for static, spherically symmetric metrics that deviate from Schwarzschild spacetime. Even at the lowest order, this approach compares well with existing methods in both accuracy and applicability. Additionally, we show that the lowest-order interpolating metric reliably predicts light ring locations. It closely matches exact results, even when unsuitable for quasinormal frequency calculations.</description>

      <title>Overtones behavior of higher dimensional black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational perturbations of higher-dimensional black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, proposed by Boulware and Deser, have been extensively studied in numerous works, primarily focusing on the fundamental mode. These studies have shown that for sufficiently small black holes, comparing to the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter, a dynamical instability arises. In this work, for the first time, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of overtones. We demonstrate that while the fundamental mode remains largely unchanged due to the limited stability region, the first few overtones deviate from their Tangherlini limits at an increasing rate. This deviation reflects the impact of the coupling parameter on the near-horizon structure of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Testing the Starobinsky model of inflation with resonant cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in the Starobinsky inflation model stochastic gravitational waves are produced when the scalaron - which is the massive scalar mode of the metric - decays into gravitons during reheating. This decay is accompanied by decay of scalaron into matter as well through a similar coupling, proving an efficient reheating stage. The stochastic gravitational waves thus produced have characteristic strain $h_c\sim 10^{-35}-10^{-34}$ in the frequency range $10^{5}-10^{12}\, {\rm Hz}$ which makes them accessible to resonant cavity searches for graviton to photon conversions. Their detection could conclusively validate the Starobinsky inflation model.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Palatini Formulation of Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Palatini formulation has been successful in the development of several alternative theories of gravity. It is well understood that the Palatini and metric formulations are equivalent in minimally coupled scalar-tensor models, but nonminimal scalar-tensor models can lead to physically distinct theories depending on the underlying formulation. Once a model has been selected, the choice of formulation is a discrete one, and so promoting it to be continuous is expected to give rise to a wider class of actions. To this end, we propose the "quasi-Palatini" formulation, a method for interpolating between the metric and Palatini formulations for a given model that gives rise to a continuous family of models. We apply the quasi-Palatini formulation to Higgs inflation, induced gravity inflation, and Starobinsky inflation, and demonstrate how this leads to a deformation of the potential, studying its impact on observables. We also discuss how the interpolation between different actions can be extended to scalar-torsion and scalar-nonmetricity models.</description>

      <title>A new rotating black hole from the Newman-Janis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. To derive this solution, we use the Newman-Janis algorithm as a mathematical tool that reduces a general rotating metric into a tractable form by applying simple physical requirements. Interestingly, the solution we found may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby challenging the no-hair theorem. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics (``hair") affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Imaging the destruction of a rotating regular black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A regular black hole, unconstrained by the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, can exceed its critical spin limit and transition into a superspinar. In this paper, we investigate the observational appearance of a rotating regular black hole, specifically the Ghosh black hole and its superspinar counterpart, when surrounded by a thin accretion disk. The resulting images reveal distinct features: the black hole closely resembles its Kerr counterpart with slight deviations, while the superspinar configuration exhibits an inner ring-like structure. Furthermore, we explore the image transition of the Ghosh black hole that has been recently destroyed by the capture of a test particle. Our findings suggest that the transition timescale becomes relevant for supermassive black holes with masses approximately twice that of M87*, making these effects potentially observable with future high-resolution instruments.</description>

      <title>Is MOND necessarily nonlinear?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The iconic, deep-MOND-limit (DML) relation between acceleration and mass, $a\sim (M\mathcal{A}_0)^{1/2}/r$, implies that, in MOND, accelerations cannot be linear in the mass distribution ($\mathcal{A}_0\equiv Ga_0$ is the DML constant, and $a_0$ the MOND acceleration). This leads to important idiosyncracies of MOND, such as a breakdown of the strong equivalence principle, and the resulting ``external-field effect''. I show that the DML axioms are, in themselves, consistent with a, possibly unique, nonrelativistic, action-based, linear formulation of the DML. This model suffers from important drawbacks, which may make it unacceptable as a basis for a full-fledged MOND theory. The model is unique among MOND theories propounded to date not only in being linear -- hence not exhibiting an external-field effect, for example -- but in constituting a modification of both Newtonian inertia and Newtonian gravity. This linear and time-local model inspires and begets several, one-parameter families of models. One family employs nonlinear, time-nonlocal kinetic terms, but still linear gravitational-field equations. Other families generalize the DMLs of AQUAL and QUMOND, modifying gravity as well as inertia. All families employ fractional time derivatives and possibly fractional Laplacians. At present, I cannot base some acceptable MOND theory on these models -- for example, I cannot offer a sensible umbrella theory that interpolates between these DML models and Newtonian dynamics. They are, however, quite useful in elucidating various matter-of-principle aspects of MOND; e.g., they help to understand which predictions follow from only the basic tenets of MOND -- so-called primary predictions -- and which are secondary, i.e., theory dependent. The models may also show the way to a wider class of MOND theories. (Abridged.)</description>

      <title>Compactification of Anisotropies in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Specifically, we examine the simplest scenario in which the scalar field lacks a kinetic term, and its kinetic contribution arises from an integration by parts of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. We consider four- and five-dimensional anisotropic spacetimes, focusing on Bianchi I and extended Bianchi I geometries. Our study reveals that the asymptotic solutions correspond to locally symmetric spacetimes where at least two scale factors exhibit analogous behavior or, alternatively, to isotropic configurations where all scale factors evolve identically. Additionally, we discuss the effects of a cosmological constant, finding that the presence of the cosmological constant does not lead to an isotropic universe.</description>

      <title>Will LAGEOS and LARES 2 succeed in accurately measuring frame-dragging?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current LAGEOS-LARES 2 experiment aims to accurately measure the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect in the gravitomagnetic field of the spinning Earth generated by the latter's angular momentum $\boldsymbol{J}$. The key quantity to a priori analytically assess the overall systematic uncertainty is the ratio $\mathcal{R}^{J_2}$ of the sum of the classical precessions of the satellites' nodes $\Omega$ induced by the Earth's oblateness $J_2$ to the sum of their post-Newtonian counterparts. $In$ $principle$, if the sum of the inclinations $I$ of both satellites were $exactly$ $180^\circ$, the semimajor axes $a$ and the eccentricities $e$ being $identical$, $\mathcal{R}^{J_2}$ would $exactly$ vanish. Actually, it is $not$ so by a large amount because of the departures of the $real$ satellites' orbital configurations from their $ideal$ ones. Thus, $J_2$ impacts not only directly through its own uncertainty, but also $indirectly$ through the errors in all the other physical and orbital parameters entering $\mathcal{R}^{J_2}$. The consequences of this fact are examined in greater details than done so far in the literature. The Van Patten and Everitt's proposal in 1976 of looking at the sum of the node precessions of two counter-orbiting spacecraft in (low-altitude) circular polar orbits is revamped rebranding it POLAr RElativity Satellites (POLARES).

      <title>Quadratic quasinormal modes at null infinity on a Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ringdown of perturbed black holes has been studied since the 1970s, but until recently, studies have focused on linear perturbations. There is now burgeoning interest in nonlinear perturbative effects during ringdown. Here, using a hyperboloidal framework, we provide a complete treatment of linear and quadratic quasinormal modes (QNMs and QQNMs) in second-order perturbation theory, in Schwarzschild spacetime. We include novel methods for extracting QNMs and QQNMs amplitudes using a Laplace transform treatment, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary initial data. We produce both time- and frequency-domain codes. From these codes, we present new results further exploring the unforeseen dependence of QQNMs amplitudes on the parity of the progenitor system, as demonstrated in our letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 061401 (2025)]. Our numerical results are restricted to perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole, but our methods extend straightforwardly to the astrophysically realistic case of a Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological degrees of freedom of Proca field with non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity through the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar interactions. We show that in the homogeneous and isotropic Universe together with cosmological constant, the temporal component of the vector field acquires a background value. As a result, we show that the theory propagates an additional degree of freedom, with respect to the generalized Proca theories, whose kinetic term suggests the presence of several strong coupling regimes that depend on the value of the background solution, the combination and vanishing of coupling constants, together with a scale-dependent one. We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling. In addition, we discover a mode with scale-dependent strong coupling (vanishing kinetic term), one mode that propagates only in one single direction and two unstable modes.</description>

      <title>Global Portraits of Inflation in Nonsingular Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the phase space perspective, scalar field slow roll inflation is described by a heteroclinic orbit from a saddle type fixed point to a final attractive point. In many models the saddle point resides in the scalar field asymptotics, and thus for a comprehensive view of the dynamics a global phase portrait is necessary. For this task, in the literature one mostly encounters dynamical variables that either render the initial or the final state singular, thus obscuring the full picture. In this work we construct a hybrid set of variables which allow the depiction of both the initial and final states distinctly in nonsingular manner. To illustrate the method, we apply these variables to portray various interesting types of scalar field inflationary models like metric Higgs inflation, metric Starobinsky inflation, pole inflation, and a nonminimal Palatini model.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Bronnikov-Ellis wormhole with double-null simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical collapse of Bronnikov-Ellis (BE) wormhole using the double-null formalism, where its throat is characterized by the coincidence of two curves $r_{,u} = 0$ and $r_{,v} = 0$. The emission of two ingoing pulses: normal scalar and phantom fields in the wormhole spacetime reveals two distinct instability scenarios: a normal scalar field triggers gravitational collapse into a black hole where the singularity $r=0$ hidden by the event horizon ($r_{,u}=0$ and $r_{,v}=0$); while a phantom field drives inflationary expansion of wormhole, decoupling two asymptotic regions with the cosmological horizon ($r_{,u}=0$ and $r_{,v}=0$). The process of two scenarios can be accelerated by increasing the amplitude of pulses but can be delayed by increasing the wormhole's mass. Additionally, the collisions of two identical pulses from ingoing and outgoing null directions in the massless BE wormhole fail to cure the instabilities because the two scenarios can still occur, but the formation of a black hole can be delayed for the collision of normal and phantom fields. Interestingly, the strategic tuning of emission timing for outgoing phantom field to collide with ingoing normal scalar field can temporarily stabilize the wormhole throat by restoring the coincidence of $r_{,u}$ and $r_{,v}$ again after their separation. This offers us valuable insights into extending the lifetime of a traversable wormhole.</description>

      <title>A Reduction Algorithm for Cosmological Correlators: Cuts, Contractions, and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators are fundamental observables in an expanding universe and are highly non-trivial functions even at tree-level. In this work, we uncover novel structures in the space of such tree-level correlators that enable us to develop a new recursive algorithm for their explicit computation. We begin by formulating cosmological correlators as solutions to GKZ systems and develop a general strategy to construct additional differential operators, called reduction operators, when a GKZ system is reducible. Applying this framework, we determine all relevant reduction operators, and show that they can be used to build up the space of functions needed to represent the correlators. Beyond relating different integrals, these operators also yield a large number of algebraic relations, including cut and contraction relations between diagrams. This implies a significant reduction in the number of functions needed to represent each tree-level cosmological correlator. We present first steps to quantify the complexity of our reduction algorithm by using the Pfaffian framework. While we focus on tree-level cosmological correlators, our approach provides a blueprint for other perturbative settings.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</description>

      <title>Core Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave Sourcing and Characterization based on Three-Dimensional Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present for the first time an analysis of high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) emission from proto-neutron stars (PNS) in core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) that combines spatial decomposition and modal decomposition to both source and characterize the emission. Our analysis is based on three-dimensional CCSN simulations initiated from two progenitors with differing mass and metallicity. We spatially decompose GW strains into five regions and show they are initially largest in the PNS surface layers from accretion and later largest from the Ledoux convective and convective overshoot regions within the PNS. We compute the fractional GW luminosity and observe that the majority of the luminosity moves from the same outer layers to deep within the PNS at comparable times. Using a self-consistent perturbative analysis, we investigate the evolution of the oscillation modes of the PNS. We find that the frequency of the evolving high-frequency component of the GW signal is well matched to the ${}^2g_2$-mode, the ${}^2g_1$-mode, and the ${}^2f$-mode over time. We show that the ${}^2g$-modes emit most of their power in GWs initially from the PNS surface region, but within a few 100 ms after bounce, it is the convective overshoot region of the PNS that emits the most GW power for the ${}^2g_1$-mode. Eventually, the ${}^2f$-mode is the dominant mode producing GWs, and they are emitted primarily from the convective overshoot region. Thus, with three interconnected analyses, we show that, while the GW emission is global, stemming from multiple regions in and around the PNS, we are able to source the dominant contributions to it. We find that high-frequency GW emission from the PNS in CCSNe is more complex than assessed by other methods, and dependent, first emitted mainly by ${}^2g$-modes driven by accretion onto the PNS and later emitted by the ${}^2f$-mode driven by sustained Ledoux convection.</description>

      <title>Quantum proper time: A Finsler space from entropy and purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum clock cannot be modeled as a point mass moving along a single geodesic if it is in a state with nonzero position fluctuations. Instead, it is an extended object subject to tidal forces and a superposition of time dilations at different altitudes. Here, a geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics is used to show that additional quantum properties representing correlations between different directions imply a non-Riemannian geometrical structure experienced by a quantum clock. A specific version of Finsler geometry parameterized by entropy and purity of the state provides a novel setting for a combination of quantum and gravitational effects. A crucial ingredient is given by a new parameterization of quantum-information properties related to second-order moments of a state and may also be useful in other applications.</description>

      <title>Analytical description for light propagation with the source inside the black hole photon sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photon sphere defines the unstable circular orbit of photons in a black hole spacetime. Photons emitted by a source located inside the photon sphere can be gravitationally lensed by the black hole and have time delays when reaching the observer. These delays may lead to light echoes produced in the light curve if an accretion event in the vicinity of the horizon can be observed. In this work, we present fully analytical formulas with high accuracy to describe the change of the azimuthal angle and the travel time of those photons. By employing the analytical approaches, we find that the time delay between photons emitted from the interior of the photon sphere has a typical time scale of $2(\pi - \phi_\mathrm{S}) u_\mathrm{m}$ with $\phi_\mathrm{S}$ and $u_\mathrm{m}$ being respectively the azimuthal angle of the source and the impact parameter evaluated at the photon sphere, which can provide some clues on the future search for gravitational lensing signatures in the accretion inflow event.</description>

      <title>Causality violation of Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton equation: direct test on the horizon?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quote a definitive simple proof that neither classical stochastic dynamics nor quantum dynamics can be nonlinear if we stick to their standard statistical interpretations. A recently proposed optomechanical test of gravity's classicality versus quantumness is based on the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Newton equation (SNE) which is the nonrelativistic limit of standard semiclassical gravity. While in typical cosmological applications of semiclassical gravity the predicted violation of causality is ignored, it cannot be disregarded in applications of the SNE in high sensitive laboratory tests hoped for the coming years. We reveal that, in a recently designed experiment, quantum optical monitoring of massive probes predicts fake action-at-a-distance (acausality) on a single probe already. The proposed experiment might first include the direct test of this acausality.</description>

      <title>Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to the cosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmological model to include additional density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, which arise from finite-T quantum gravitational effects. Using the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System, we analyze the impact of these corrections on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and compare the results with the Planck 2018 data. Through brute-force parameter scans and advanced machine learning techniques, including quartic regression, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving high $R^2$ values and low mean squared error. The present work paves the way for future research into higher-order corrections and enhanced computational methods for cosmological parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Equation of the Large U(1) Chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we first heuristically constitute the charges for the chiral transformation associated with the large U(1) gauge symmetry. We name those as the large chiral charges, and the chiral transformation those generate as the large chiral transformations. Then, showing that those can be obtained based on Noether's theorem, we once obtain the anomaly equation associated with those large chiral transformations. Then, for the one-loop diagrams of the fermionic field coupling to the multiple classical gauge fields (those constitute the effective action of the model in this study with regard to the gauge field), we perform an axailization. Then, defining the BRS transformations for the large U(1) gauge symmetry (we name those as the large BRS transformation), we perform those large BRS transformations to those axialized one-loop diagrams. Then, evaluating those, we show that the anomaly equations mentioned above can be derived. It is also shown that those anomaly equations can be derived in Fujikawa method. The result in this study would be important as a development of the large U(1) gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Exploring light deflection and black hole shadows in Rastall theory with plasma effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the gravitational deflection of particles in curved spacetime immersed in perfect fluid in the context of Rastall theory. We propose an infinite region approach to Gibbons-Werner to avoid singularity, given that the integral region is generally infinite. In the Rastall theory framework, the black hole solutions in the dust field are studied. Additionally, we check the deflection angle from this spacetime under the influence of plasma. Furthermore, we analytically compute plasma's impact on a black hole shadow using a ray-tracing approach and Hamiltonian equation. Hence, the light ray motion equations are independent of the plasma's velocity. It is assumed that plasma is a dispersive medium, pressureless and non-magnetised, and the plasma particle density corresponds to particle accumulation. The supermassive black hole's shadow and emitted energy are explored when plasma falls radially from infinity onto the black hole.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the early universe in Einstein-Cartan theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein-Cartan theory is a generalization of general relativity that introduces spacetime torsion. In this paper, we perform phase space analysis to investigate the evolution of the early universe in Einstein-Cartan theory. By studying the stability of critical points in the dynamical system, we find that there exist two stable critical points which represent an Einstein static solution and an expanding solution, respectively. After analyzing the phase diagram of the dynamical system, we find that the early universe may exhibit an Einstein static state, an oscillating state, or a bouncing state. By assuming the equation of state $\omega$ can decrease over time $t$, the universe can depart from the initial Einstein static state, oscillating state, or bouncing state and then evolve into an inflationary phase. Then, we analyze four different inflationary evolution cases in Einstein-Cartan theory and find that a time-variable equation of state $\omega$ cannot yield values of $n_{s}$ and $r$ consistent with observations, while a time-invariant equation of state $\omega$ is supported by the Planck 2018 results. Thus, in Einstein-Cartan theory, the universe likely originates from a bouncing state rather than an Einstein static state or an oscillating state.</description>

      <title>Cosmic slowing down of acceleration with the Chaplygin-Jacobi gas as a dark fluid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A particular generalization of the Chaplygin inflationary model, using the formalism of Hamilton-Jacobi and elliptic functions, results in a more general non-linear Chaplygin-type equation of state (Chaplygin-Jacobi model). We investigate the implementation of this model as a dark energy (DE) fluid to explain the recent acceleration of the universe. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM and other Chaplygin-like fluids, where the final fate of the universe is an eternal de Sitter (dS) phase, the dynamics of this model allows for the possibility of a decelerating phase in the future, following the current accelerating phase. In other words, a transient acceleration arises, accounting for the recently claimed slowing down phenomenon. This Chaplygin-Jacobi model shows important differences compared to the standard and generalized Chaplygin gas models. Additionally, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using several datasets, including Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) to examine the observational viability of the model. Our results indicate that, although a transient phase of accelerated expansion is supported by current observations in the context of the Chaplygin-Jacobi model, this model is strongly disfavored in comparison with $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

Abstract: The existence of fluctuations at the early stage of the universe provides enough confidence to rely on the averaging methods. However, the nonlinearity of general relativity makes it extremely difficult. There are different methods to study inhomogeneous cosmology and provide a straightforward solution to the averaging problem in cosmology, such as Buchert's spatial averaging. I am attempting to study early cosmic inflation using Buchert equations and the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism. Buchert equations and Mori-Zwanzig formalism's coarse-grained description are the geometrical source of early cosmic inflation through higher-order differential equations. It can be seen that the observational data and the given theoretical results are in agreement.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric loop quantum gravity: Schwarzschild spacetimes with a cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04925v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a quantization of the Schwarzschild spacetime in the presence of a cosmological constant, based on midisuperspace methods developed in the spherically symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity, using in particular the 'improved dynamics' scheme. We include both the de Sitter and anti-de Sitter cases. We find that the quantization puts a Planckian positive upper limit on the possible values of the cosmological constant similar to the bounds obtained earlier from studies of homogeneous spacetimes. This means that, for negative cosmological constant, no negative bound is found. Moreover, using semiclassical physical states, we obtain the effective metric and demonstrate the causal structure for various cases. Quantum gravity modifications ensure that the singularity is replaced by a transition surface in all the cases, where the curvature invariants approach mass-independent Planckian bounds. Analysis of the effective stress-energy tensor shows that the null energy condition is strongly violated in the vicinity of the transition surface. Moreover, it shows a weaker asymptotic fall off for a nonvanishing cosmological constant, which could have interesting phenomenological implications.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>

      <title>A Study of Black Holes in $F(R)-$ModMax Gravity: Gravitational Lensing and Constraints from EHT Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is an effective approach to properly understand the modified gravity and explore its validity. Motivated by recent astrophysical observations, we consider a black hole (BH) in $F(R)-$ModMax gravity and study the optical features such as the shadow's geometrical shape, energy emission rate, and deflection of light. More specifically, we show how the variation of the model parameters imprints specific signatures on these optical quantities. In the following, we consider such black holes as supermassive BHs and evaluate the parameters of the model with shadow size estimates done by the observations of M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). According to our findings, the parameter $f_{R_{0}}$ plays an effective role in having results consistent with the EHT data such that the resulting shadow of AdS black holes in $F(R)-$ModMax gravity agrees with the observational data for $f_{R_{0}}&lt;-1$. However, for dS black holes, a consistent result is observed for $f_{R_{0}}&gt;-1$.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Lyapunov exponent of circular light orbits in black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chaotic systems near black holes satisfy a universal bound, $\lambda \leq \kappa_H$ linking the Lyapunov coefficient $\lambda$ associated with unstable orbits to surface gravity $\kappa_H$ of the event horizon. A natural question is whether this bound is satisfied by unstable circular null geodesics in the vicinity of black holes. However, there are known cases where this bound is violated. It is intriguing to ask whether there exists an alternative universal bound that is valid in such situations. We show that for any spherically symmetric, static black hole that satisfies Einstein's equations and the dominant energy condition, there exist other universal bounds relating the Lyapunov coefficient to a generalized notion of surface gravity at the photon sphere. As applications, we show how these bounds also constrain the imaginary part of quasinormal modes in the eikonal regime and how the Lyapunov coefficient relates to the shadow size and the entropy of the horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the classical and quantum evolution of inflationary cosmological perturbations from quantum initial conditions, using the on-shell and off-shell contributions to correlators to investigate the signatures of interactions. In particular, we calculate the Keldysh contributions to the leading order bispectrum from past infinity, showing that the squeezed limit is dominated by the on-shell evolution. By truncating the time integrals in the analytic expressions for contributions to the bispectrum, we define a `quantum interactivity' and quantitatively identify scales and times for which it is sufficient to only assume classical evolution, given a fixed precision. In contrast to typical perceptions inspired by free two-point functions, we show that common non-linear contributions to inflationary perturbations can be well-described by classical evolution even prior to horizon crossing. The insights gained here can pave the way for quantitative criteria for justifying the validity of numerically simulating the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations in inflation. In particular, we comment on the validity of using stochastic inflation to reproduce known in-in perturbative results. An extensive appendix provides a review of the Keldysh formulation of the in-in formalism with the initial state set at a finite, as opposed to infinite past, emphasizing the importance of considering temporal boundary terms and the initial state for correctly obtaining the propagators. We also show how stochastic dynamics can emerge as a sufficiently accurate approximation to the full quantum evolution. This becomes particularly transparent in the Keldysh description.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Waterfall: a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation with Page curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation based on the analogy of the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) when the black hole (pump) is allowed to deplete to zero mass. The model incorporates an additional new feature that allows for the interior Hawking partner-particles (idlers) behind the horizon to further generate new Hawking particle pairs of lower energy, one of which remains behind the horizon, and the other that adds to the externally emitted Hawking radiation (signals) outside the horizon. This model produces a Page curve for the evolution of the reduced density matrices for the evaporating black hole internal degrees of freedom entangled with the generated Hawking radiation pairs entangled across the horizon. The Page curve yields an entropy that rises at early times during the evaporation process as Hawking pairs are generated, reaches a peak midway through the evolution, and then decays to zero upon complete evaporation of the black hole. The entire system remains in a pure state at all times undergoing unitary (squeezed state) evolution, with the initial state of the black hole modeled as a bosonic Fock state of large, but finite number $n_{p0}$ of particles. For the final state of the system, the black hole reaches the vacuum state of zero mass, while the external Hawking radiation carries away the total energy of the initial black hole. Inside the horizon there remains $n_{p0}$ Hawking partner-particles of vanishingly small total energy, reminiscent of the "soft-hair" (zero energy) qubit model of Hotta, Nambu and Yamaguchi, but now from a Hamiltonian for squeezed state generation perspective. The model presented here can be readily extended to encompass arbitrary initial pure states for the black hole, and in falling matter.</description>

      <title>Effective-one-body model for coalescing binary neutron stars: Incorporating tidal spin and enhanced radiation from dynamical tides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal interactions in a coalescing binary neutron star (BNS) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) system driven by gravitational wave (GW) radiation contain precious information about physics both at extreme density and in the highly relativistic regime. In the late inspiral stage, where the tidal effects are the strongest, dynamical corrections to the tidal response become significant. Previous analyses model the finite-frequency correction through the effective Love number approach, which only accounts for the correction in the radial interaction but ignores the lag in the tidal bulge behind the companion due to the continuous orbital shrinkage. The lag provides a torque, causing the star's spin to change over time. We dub the evolving component of the spin the tidal spin, whose dimensionless value can reach 0.03-0.4 depending on how rapidly the background star rotates. We present an effective-one-body (EOB) waveform model for BNSs and NSBHs incorporating the tidal spin, particularly its back reaction to the orbit due to the Newtonian tidal torque and the relativistic orbital hang-up. Beyond the conservative dynamics, we also derive the corrections to the dissipative radiation due to finite-frequency effects to the first post-Newtonian order. Depending on the star's background spin, the phase error in the time-domain waveform due to ignoring the tidal spin ranges from 0.3 to 4 radians at the waveform's peak amplitude. The difference in the waveforms with and without the tidal spin remarkably resembles the difference between previous effective Love number models and numerical relativity simulations, underscoring the significance of tidal spin in the construction of faithful models. Our model further extends the description of dynamics in the high-background spin regions of the parameter space that are yet to be covered by numerical simulations.</description>

We conduct a systematic comparison of various EOS models by using posterior distributions obtained from EOS-agnostic Bayesian inference of binary parameters applied to GWs from a population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The cumulative evidence for each model is calculated in a multi-dimensional parameter space characterized by neutron star masses and tidal deformabilities. Our findings indicate that Bayesian model selection is most effective when performed in the two-dimensional subspace of component mass and tidal deformability, requiring fewer events to distinguish between EOS models with high confidence. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between the precision of tidal deformability measurements and the accuracy of model selection, taking into account the evolving sensitivities of current and planned GW observatories. BEOMS offers computational efficiency and can be adapted to execute model selection for gravitational wave data from other sources.</description>

      <title>Love numbers beyond GR from the modified Teukolsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the full set of tidal Love numbers of non-rotating black holes in an effective field theory extension of general relativity. We achieve our results using a recently introduced modified Teukolsky equation that describes the perturbations of black holes in this theory. We show how to identify the Love numbers and their beta functions in a systematic and gauge invariant way, applying analytic continuation on the angular number $\ell$ when necessary. We observe that there are three types of Love numbers: electric, magnetic, and a ``mixing'' type, associated to parity-breaking theories, that we identify here for the first time. The modified Teukolsky equation proves to be very useful as it allows us to obtain all the different Love numbers in a unified framework. We compare our results with previous literature that utilized the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations to compute Love numbers, finding perfect agreement. The method introduced here paves the way towards the computation of Love numbers of rotating black holes beyond general relativity.</description>

Abstract: We analyze scalar wave emission from unbound orbits in a Topological Star spacetime. Our study uses a self-force approach and leads to a Post-Newtonian reconstruction of the field along the orbit, both in the time domain and in the frequency domain.

      <title>Differential torsion sensor for direct detection of ultralight vector dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons with masses in the range from $\sim 10^{-22}$ eV/$c^2$ to $\sim 1$ eV/$c^2$, are well-motivated, wave-like dark matter candidates. Particles on the lower-mass end are less explored in experiments due to their vanishingly small mass and weak coupling to the Standard Model. We propose a sensor with dual torsion pendulums for the direct detection of U(1)$_{B\!-\!L}$ gauge boson dark matter, which can achieve an enhanced differential torque sensitivity in a frequency band of $\sim 10^{-2}$-$10$ Hz due to its advantages in common-mode rejection and differential angular sensitivity. We describe the design of the differential torsion sensor and present the estimated sensitivity to an ultralight dark matter field coupled to baryon minus lepton ($B\!-\!L$) number, in a mass range of $\sim 10^{-17}$-$10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$. Given a setup with meter-scale torsion pendulum beams and kg-scale test masses, the projected constraints on the coupling constant $g_{B\!-\!L}$ can reach $\sim 10^{-27}$ for a boson mass of $\sim 10^{-15}$ eV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Conservative Spin Magnitude Change in Orbital Evolution in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that physical scattering observables for compact spinning objects in general relativity can depend on additional degrees of freedom in the spin tensor beyond those described by the spin vector alone. The impulse, spin kick, and leading-order waveforms exhibit such a nontrivial dependence. A signal of this additional structure is the change in the magnitude of the spin vector under conservative Hamiltonian evolution, similar to our previous studies in electrodynamics. These additional degrees of freedom describe dynamical mass multipoles of compact objects and decouple for black holes. We also show that the conservative impulse, spin kick and change of the additional degrees of freedom are encoded in the eikonal phase.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions and obtain a general theory of gravity with Weyl gauge symmetry of dilatations (Weyl-DBI). This is done in the Weyl gauge covariant formulation of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, suitable for a gauge theory, in which this geometry is metric. The Weyl-DBI action is a special gauge theory in that it has the same gauge invariant expression with dimensionless couplings in any dimension $d$, with no need for a UV regulator (be it a DR subtraction scale, field or higher derivative operator) for which reason we argue it is Weyl-anomaly free. For $d=4$ dimensions, the leading order of a series expansion of the Weyl-DBI action recovers the gauge invariant Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that is Weyl anomaly-free; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda&gt;0$. All the remaining terms of this series expansion are of non-perturbative nature but can, in principle, be recovered by (perturbative) quantum corrections in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$ in a gauge invariant (geometric) regularisation, provided by the Weyl-DBI action. If the Weyl gauge boson is not dynamical the Weyl-DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action. All fields and scales have geometric origin, with no added matter, scalar field compensators or UV regulators.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Black Hole Spin and Plasma Acceleration in Jet Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the polarization of black hole jets on scales of $10-10^3\,GM/c^2$ and show that large spatial swings in the polarization occur at three characteristic distances from the black hole: the radius where the counter-jet dims, the radius where the magnetic field becomes azimuthally dominated (the light cylinder), and the radius where the plasma reaches its terminal Lorentz factor. To demonstrate the existence of these swings, we derive a correspondence between axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic outflows and their force-free limits, which allows us to analytically compute the plasma kinematics and magnetic field structure of collimated, general relativistic jets. We then use this method to ray trace polarized images of black hole jets with a wide range of physical parameters, focusing on roughly face-on jets like that of M87. We show that the location of the polarization swings is strongly tied to the location of the light cylinder and thus to the black hole's spin, illustrating a new method of measuring spin from polarized images of the jet. This signature of black hole spin should be observable by future interferometric arrays like the (Next Generation) Event Horizon Telescope, which will be able to resolve the polarized emission of the jet down to the near-horizon region at high dynamic range.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behavior of Lorentz-violating photon fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive the Newman-Penrose formalism of Maxwell's equations using two approaches: differential forms and intrinsic derivatives. Denoting $(k_{AF})^\mu$ as $k^\mu$, with $k^\mu=(k^t,k^r,0,0)$ in spherically symmetric spacetimes, we show that the expansion in $r^{-1}$ fails to produce consistent, closed solutions due to the inability to separate Lorentz-violating (LV) phase factors, as the Lorentz-invariant (LI) null tetrad does not adapt to the LV wavefront. Moreover, with exact formal solutions, we demonstrate that the expansion is nonperturbative in the LV parameter $k^2\equiv k^t-k^r$. For $r\gg1/k^2$, higher powers of $k^2$ dominate over lower powers, as the latter decay more rapidly with increasing $r$. Although the Coulomb mode $\phi_1\sim\mathcal{O}(\ln{r}/r^2)$ deviates from the LI expectation $\mathcal{O}(r^{-2})$ due to LV corrections, the leading outgoing radiation mode remains unaffected, i.e., $\phi_2\sim\mathcal{O}(r^{-1})$. Given the constraint $|k_{AF}|\le10^{-44}$GeV \cite{CMBLV-N}, the three complex scalars $\phi_a$ ($a=0,1,2$) still obey the peeling theorem: $\phi_a\sim\mathcal{O}(r^{(a-3)}),~a=0,1,2$ for large, finite distances.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>General parametrization for energy density of quintessence field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general parametrization for energy density of a quintessence field, a minimally coupled canonical scalar field which rolls down slowly during the late time. This parametrization can mimic all classes of quintessence dynamics, namely scaling-freezing, tracker and thawing dynamics for any redshift. For thawing dynamics the parametrization needs two free parameters while for scaling-freezing and tracker dynamics it needs at least four free parameters. More parameters make the model less interesting from the observational data analysis point of view but as we expect more precise data in future it may be possible to constrain the models with multiple free parameters which can tell about the dynamics more precisely. One of the main advantage of this parametrization is that it reduces the computational time to significant amount while mimicking the actual scalar field dynamics for all redshifts which may not be possible with other existing parametrizations. We compare the parametrization with two and four parameters with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrizations using cosmological observational data from Planck 2018 (distance priors), DESI $2024$ DR1, PantheonPlus, Hubble parameter measurements and the redshift space distortion. We find that the observational data prefers standard $\Lambda$CDM model over other models. If we allow phantom region then it is more preferred by the data compared to non-phantom thawing quintessence. Our analysis does not show any preference of the dynamical dark energy over a cosmological constant except for the CPL parametrization.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the primordial curvature perturbations at small scales between $4.5\times 10^{18}$ and $1.8\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, basing on the observations of cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the constrains are mainly from the studies on the primordial black holes (PBHs). Specifically, on small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, the limits arise from studies on the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBHs radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after its evaporation. It has been demonstrated that the big bang nucleosynthesis can be used to constrain the initial fraction of PBHs with masses $10^{9}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$, corresponding to the scales $10^{16}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{18}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Recently, on one hand, it is found that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, resulting in the influences on the primordial abundance of light nuclei. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the `memory burden' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black hole (BH), leading to the existence of light PBHs by now. Based on the recent theoretical research process of BH and the limits on the (initial) mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{4}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{10}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $1.5\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, which are rarely studied in previous literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The backreaction of quantum degrees of freedom on classical backgrounds is a poorly understood topic in theoretical physics. Most often it is treated within the semiclassical approximation with the help of various ad hoc prescriptions accounting for the effect of quantum excitations on the dynamics of the background. We focus on two popular ones: (i) the mean-field approximation whereby quantum degrees of freedom couple to the classical background via their quantum expectation values; (ii) the (stochastic) Truncated Wigner method whereby the fully coupled system is evolved using classical equations of motion for various randomly sampled initial conditions of the quantum degree of freedom, and a statistical average is performed a posteriori. We evaluate the performance of each method in a simple toy model against a fully quantum mechanical treatment, and identify its regime of validity. We interpret the results in terms of quantum entanglement and loss of classicality of the background.</description>

Abstract: As an update to our previously performed Bayesian inference analyses of the neutron star matter equation-of-state and related quantities, the additional impact of the recently published NICER data of PSR J0437-4751 is examined. Including the mass and radius distributions of this pulsar in our data base results in modest shifts from previously inferred median posterior values of radii $R$ and central densities $n_c$ for representative $1.4\,M_\odot$ and $2.1\,M_\odot$ neutron stars: radii are reduced by about $0.2-0.3$ km to values of $R_{1.4} = 12.1\pm 0.5$ km and $R_{2.1} = 11.9^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ km (at the 68\% level), and central densities increase slightly to values of $n_c(1.4\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 2.8\pm 0.3$ and $n_c(2.1\,M_\odot)/n_0 = 3.8_{-0.7}^{+0.6}$ (in units of equilibrium nuclear matter density, $n_0 = 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$), i.e., they still fall below five times nuclear saturation density at the 68\% level. As a further significant result, the evidence established by analyzing Bayes factors for a negative trace anomaly measure, $\Delta = 1/3-P/\varepsilon &lt; 0$, inside heavy neutron stars is raised to strong.</description>

      <title>A Counterintuitive Correlation Between Neutron-Star Radii Inferred from Pulse Modeling and Surface Emission Beaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal X-ray emission from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, shaped by gravitational lensing and the beaming of the surface radiation, provides critical insights into neutron star properties. This approach has been the focus of observations with the NICER mission. Using a semi-analytic model to calculate pulse profiles, we investigate the effects of adopting incorrect beaming models on the inferred compactness of neutron stars. We demonstrate that assuming a more centrally peaked beaming pattern when fitting data from a more isotropic emitter leads to an underestimation of compactness in the case of two antipodal polar caps. We present a detailed analysis of this counterintuitive result, offering both qualitative insights and quantitative estimates. If the atmospheric heating in the millisecond pulsars observed with NICER is shallow, the inferred radii for these sources could be significantly overestimated, with important implications for neutron star structure and equation-of-state constraints.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. At the core of the $\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological term, $\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the DESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be dynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. However, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [45] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift $z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to cure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM), which in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of negative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and DESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut down. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM performs much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data (replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the main dynamical DE models (including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the $H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the internal conflict in the BAO sector.</description>

      <title>Consistent Warped $\mathbb R\times T^{1,1}$ Reduction of Heterotic Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a curious duality between the bosonic sector of heterotic supergravity and the noncritical bosonic string with conformal anomaly. This allows us to map the Mink$_4\times S^3\times S^3$ vacuum of the bosonic string to a new warped $\mathbb R\times (T^{1,1}\times$Mink$_4)$ vacuum of the heterotic theory, which turns out to be supersymmetric, preserving $1/4$ of the supersymmetry. We perform consistent dimensional reduction of the heterotic theory on the warped $\mathbb R\times T^{1,1}$ internal space and obtain ${\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ supergravity, with one complex scalar multiplet and $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ Yang-Mills multiplets, where the gauge symmetry is originated from the isometry group of $T^{1,1}$.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Nature of Gravity through Classical Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of whether gravity is fundamentally quantum remains one of the most profound open problems in modern physics. A recently explored approach consists in testing gravity's ability to entangle quantum systems, which requires preparing and controlling large-mass quantum states-a formidable experimental challenge. We propose an alternative strategy that circumvents the need for quantum state engineering. We show that if gravity is classical in the sense of being a local operation and classical communication (LOCC) channel, it must necessarily introduce diffusion in the motion of quantum systems. We derive the master equation governing this diffusive dynamics and establish a lower bound on the noise that any classical gravitational interaction must induce. Next, we outline an experimental protocol based on a high-precision torsion pendulum at millikelvin temperatures, showing that the predicted diffusion, if present, is in principle detectable with near-term technology. Our approach offers a novel route to testing the classical vs quantum nature of gravity without requiring macroscopic quantum superpositions or high control of the quantum state of the system, significantly reducing the experimental complexity.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Entanglement Wedge Nesting for Holography at a Finite Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as a cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</description>

      <title>Quark-Antiquark Potential as a Probe for Holographic Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent paper (Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 12, 121601), a higher-order phase transition between the planar, charged, 5-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de Sitter black hole and a hairy black hole solution of the type IIB supergravity was investigated. Here, we set out to investigate these two phases of the theory by means of the holographic probe that describes a quark-antiquark in the dual gauge theory. We show that the study of the quark-antiquark potential turns out to be a useful method to investigate the change of behavior at different values of the parameter that controls the phase transition, this parameter being the ratio between the chemical potential and the temperature. In other words, the string serves as a probe to detect the phase transition.</description>

      <title>The Mechanism behind the Information Encoding for Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement islands are subregions in a gravitational universe whose information is fully encoded in a disconnected non-gravitational system away from it. In the context of the black hole information paradox, entanglement islands state that the information about the black hole interior is encoded in the early-time Hawking radiation. Nevertheless, it was unclear how this seemingly nonlocal information encoding emerges from a manifestly local theory. In this paper, we provide an answer to this question by uncovering the mechanism behind this information encoding scheme. As we will see, the early understanding that graviton is massive in island models plays an essential role in this mechanism. As an example, we will discuss how this mechanism works in detail in the Karch-Randall braneworld. This study also suggests the potential importance of this mechanism to the ER=EPR conjecture.</description>

      <title>An experimental platform for levitated mechanics in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on two vacuum decay models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain two vacuum decay models ($\Lambda(t)$CDM, proposed by the authors of~\cite{Brito:2024bhh}) utilizing the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance prior from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observed by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained via the cosmic chronometers (CC) method and type Ia supernova (SNIa) data. The interaction terms between dark matter and dark energy are defined as $Q=3\varepsilon H\rho_{\Lambda}$ for model I and $3\varepsilon aH\rho_{\Lambda}$ for model II. We find that the decay parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon=0.0094^{+0.0037}_{-0.0033}$ for model I and $\varepsilon=0.0119\pm{0.0045}$ for model II, respectively, indicating a potential interaction between dark matter and dark energy at the $2\sigma$ confidence level. The current Hubble parameter values are estimated to be $H_{0}=70.30\pm{0.67}$ for model I and $H_{0}=70.28\pm{0.64}$ for model II. These values of $H_0$ fall between those derived from the Planck and SH0ES data, suggesting that these two vacuum decay models could provide a potential solution to alleviate the Hubble tension problem.</description>
