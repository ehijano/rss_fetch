      <title>Beyond traditional Magnetic Resonance processing with Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart signal processing approaches using Artificial Intelligence are gaining momentum in NMR applications. In this study, we demonstrate that AI offers new opportunities beyond tasks addressed by traditional techniques. We developed and trained several artificial neural networks in our new toolbox Magnetic Resonance with Artificial intelligence (MR-Ai) to solve three "impossible" problems: quadrature detection using only Echo (or Anti-Echo) modulation from the traditional Echo/Anti-Echo scheme; accessing uncertainty of signal intensity at each point in a spectrum processed by any given method; and defining a reference-free score for quantitative access of NMR spectrum quality. Our findings highlight the potential of AI techniques to revolutionize NMR processing and analysis.</description>

      <title>Mechanically-driven growth and competition in a Voronoi model of tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms leading cells to acquire a fitness advantage and establish themselves in a population are paramount to understanding the development and growth of cancer. Although there are many works that study separately either the evolutionary dynamics or the mechanics of cancer, little has been done to couple evolutionary dynamics to mechanics. To address this question, we study a confluent model of tissue using a Self-Propelled Voronoi (SPV) model with stochastic growth rates that depend on the mechanical variables of the system. The SPV model is an out-of-equilibrium model of tissue derived from an energy functional that has a jamming/unjamming transition between solid-like and liquid-like states. By considering several scenarios of mutants invading a resident population in both phases, we determine the range of parameters that confer a fitness advantage and show that the preferred area and perimeter are the most relevant ones. We find that the liquid-like state is more resistant to invasion and show that the outcome of the competition can be determined from the simulation of a non-growing mixture. Moreover, a mean-field approximation can accurately predict the fate of a mutation affecting mechanical properties of a cell. Our results can be used to infer evolutionary dynamics from tissue images, understand cancer-suppressing effects of tissue mechanics, and even search for mechanics-based therapies.</description>

      <title>Identifying the minimal sets of distance restraints for FRET-assisted protein structural modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins naturally occur in crowded cellular environments and interact with other proteins, nucleic acids, and organelles. Since most previous experimental protein structure determination techniques require that proteins occur in idealized, non-physiological environments, the effects of realistic cellular environments on protein structure are largely unexplored. Recently, F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been shown to be an effective experimental method for investigating protein structure in vivo. Inter-residue distances measured in vivo can be incorporated as restraints in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model protein structural dynamics in vivo. Since most FRET studies only obtain inter-residue separations for a small number of amino acid pairs, it is important to determine the minimum number of restraints in the MD simulations that are required to achieve a given root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the experimental structural ensemble. Further, what is the optimal method for selecting these inter-residue restraints? Here, we implement several methods for selecting the most important FRET pairs and determine the number of pairs $N_{r}$ that are needed to induce conformational changes in proteins between two experimentally determined structures. We find that enforcing only a small fraction of restraints, $N_{r}/N \lesssim 0.08$, where $N$ is the number of amino acids, can induce the conformational changes. These results establish the efficacy of FRET-assisted MD simulations for atomic scale structural modeling of proteins in vivo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expression for the higher temperature dependence of the mean squared displacement in proteins is obtained. The quantum multi-well model explains the dynamic transitions of the proteins and minimizes the amount of parameters to a single one leading to the few-state harmonic system at low-temperatures, and, thus, justifying the possibility of using proteins as atom traps to control qubits at a bit higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Tutorials on Monte-Carlo modeling of photon transport in biological tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological tissues are complex structures composed of many elements which make light-based tissue diagnostics challenging. Over the past decades, Monte Carlo technique has been used as a fundamental and versatile approach toward modeling photon-tissue interactions. This report first describes a MC simulation of steady-state light transport in an absorbing and diffusing multi-layered structure. Further, a parallel processing solution is implemented to reduce execution time and memory requirements. Then, the nonparametric phase function, which is a discretized version of the phase function, has been discussed where the integration of the phase function is a numerical process, instead of an analytical operation. Finally, to simulate more realistic structures of biological systems, simulations are modified to incorporate objects of various shapes (sphere, ellipsoid, or cylinder) with a refractive-index mismatched boundary. The output files mainly contain 2D reflection matrix, 2D transmission matrix, and 3D absorption matrix.</description>

      <title>Active self-disassembly enhances the yield of self-assembled structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a lattice model to probe the effect of active self-disassembly on equilibrium self-assembly. Surprisingly, we find conditions under which active self-disassembly enhances the yield of a target structure above that achieved by self-assembly alone when the latter is already favoured thermodynamically. We discuss biological implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Mechanics and thermodynamics of contractile biopolymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contractile biopolymer networks, such as the actomyosin meshwork of animal cells, are ubiquitous in living organisms. The active gel theory, which provides the thermodynamic framework for these materials, has been mostly used in conjunction with the assumption that the microstructure of the biopolymer network is based on rigid rods. However, experimentally, the actin network exhibits entropic elasticity. Here we combine an entropic elasticity kinetic theory, in the spirit of the Green and Tobolsky model of transiently crosslinked networks, with an active flux modelling biological activity. We determine this active flux using Onsager reciprocal relations and interpret the corresponding microscopic dynamics. We obtain a closed model of the macroscopic mechanical behaviour. We show how this model can be written using the framework of multiplicative strain gradient decomposition, which is convenient for the resolution of such problems.</description>

      <title>Theory of cell aggregates as interacting, spinning, active polar particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a generic description of the dynamics of cell aggregates. We describe cells as polar rotating objects which mechanically interact with each other and with the surrounding medium. We use the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics to derive generic constitutive equations for the interaction forces, torques and polarity dynamics. We apply our framework to discuss spontaneous motion of cell doublets. We find a rich phase diagram of possible collective motion, including steady rotation arising from flow-polarity coupling or coupling of polarity with cell position.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>

      <title>Density Estimation via Measure Transport: Outlook for Applications in the Biological Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One among several advantages of measure transport methods is that they allow for a unified framework for processing and analysis of data distributed according to a wide class of probability measures. Within this context, we present results from computational studies aimed at assessing the potential of measure transport techniques, specifically, the use of triangular transport maps, as part of a workflow intended to support research in the biological sciences. Scenarios characterized by the availability of limited amount of sample data, which are common in domains such as radiation biology, are of particular interest. We find that when estimating a distribution density function given limited amount of sample data, adaptive transport maps are advantageous. In particular, statistics gathered from computing series of adaptive transport maps, trained on a series of randomly chosen subsets of the set of available data samples, leads to uncovering information hidden in the data. As a result, in the radiation biology application considered here, this approach provides a tool for generating hypotheses about gene relationships and their dynamics under radiation exposure.</description>

      <title>Stochastic nanoswimmer: a multistate model for enzyme self-propulsion and enhanced diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several enzymes exhibit enhanced diffusion in the presence of a substrate. One explanation of this enhancement arises from fluctuating dimer models, which suggest that enzymes have a higher diffusion constant when interacting with substrates compared to when they are free. Another possible mechanism, suggested in both experimental and theoretical studies, is that enzymes act as nanoswimmers. However, existing nanoswimmer models have struggled to account for the exceptionally high self-propulsion speeds observed in experiments, with estimated increases in diffusion due to self-propulsion found to be minimal. In this study, we model enzymes as dimers with fluctuating mobility. We show that even dimers can exhibit run-and-tumble motion when transitioning between states of varying mobility within the enzymatic cycle. By exploring a three-state enzymatic cycle, we identify the conditions under which self-propulsion speeds and increases in diffusion rate consistent with experimental observations can be achieved.</description>
