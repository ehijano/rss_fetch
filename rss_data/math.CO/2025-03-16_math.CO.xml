      <title>Geometric and Combinatorial Properties of the Alternating Sign Matrix Polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polytope $ASM_n$, the convex hull of the $n\times n$ alternating sign matrices, was introduced by Striker and by Behrend and Knight. A face of $ASM_n$ corresponds to an elementary flow grid defined by Striker, and each elementary flow grid determines a doubly directed graph defined by Brualdi and Dahl. We show that a face of $ASM_n$ is symmetric if and only if its doubly directed graph has all vertices of even degree. We show that every face of $ASM_n$ is a 2-level polytope. We show that a $d$-dimensional face of $ASM_n$ has at most $2^d$ vertices and $4(d-1)$ facets, for $d\ge 2$. We show that a $d$-dimensional face of $ASM_n$ satisfies $vf\le d2^{d+1}$, where $v$ and $f$ are the numbers of vertices and edges of the face. If the doubly directed graph of a $d$-dimensional face is 2-connected, then $v\le 2^{d-1}+2$. We describe the facets of a face and a basis for the subspace parallel to a face in terms of the elementary flow grid of the face. We prove that no face of $ASM_n$ has the combinatorial type of the Birkhoff polytope $B_3$. We list the combinatorial types of faces of $ASM_n$ that have dimension 4 or less.</description>

      <title>Expansion in Distance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The normalized distance Laplacian matrix $\mathcal{D}^{\mathcal{L}}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is a natural generalization of the normalized Laplacian matrix, arising from the matrix of pairwise distances between vertices rather than the adjacency matrix. Following the motif that this matrix behaves quite differently to the normalized Laplacian matrix, we show that both the spectral gap and Cheeger constant of $\mathcal{D}^{\mathcal{L}}(G)$ are bounded away from $0$ independently of the graph $G$. The spectral result holds more generally for finite metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich graphs act on Nambu--Poisson brackets, IV. Resilience of the graph calculus in the dimensional shift $d\mapsto d+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine whether the Kontsevich flows $\dot{P}=Q^\gamma_d(P)$ of Nambu--Poisson structures $P$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ are Poisson coboundaries, for $\gamma$ some suitable cocycle in the Kontsevich graph complex. That is, we inspect the existence of a vector field $\vec{X}^\gamma_d(P)$ such that $Q^\gamma_d(P)=[[ P,\vec{X}^\gamma_d(P)]]$, where $[[\cdot,\cdot]]$ is the Schouten bracket of multivector fields (the generalised Lie bracket). To tackle this class of problems in dimensions $d\geq3$, we introduced a series of simplications in paper II (arXiv:2409.12555); here, we present a series of results regarding the down-up behaviour of solutions $\vec{X}^\gamma_d(P)$ and vanishing micro-graphs in the course of dimension shift $d\mapsto d+1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this series of papers, we established that $Q^{\gamma_3}_{d=4}(P)$ is a coboundary in 4D (paper II arXiv:2409.12555), and we presented a series of experimental results about the (non)trivialisation of Kontsevich graph flows of Nambu--Poisson brackets on $\mathbb{R}^d$ (paper IV). This immediate sequel V. to I.--IV. is a guide to working with the package $\textsf{gcaops}$ (https://github.com/rburing/gcaops) ($\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$omplex $\textbf{A}$ction $\textbf{O}$n $\textbf{P}$oisson $\textbf{S}$tructures) for $\textsf{SageMath}$ by Buring (2022). Specifically, we shall explain the script used in paper II (arXiv:2409.12555) and the use of it.</description>

      <title>A new combinatorial interpretation of partial sums of $m$-step Fibonacci numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequence of partial sums of Fibonacci numbers, beginning with $2$, $4$, $7$, $12$, $20$, $33,\dots$, has several combinatorial interpretations (OEIS A000071). For instance, the $n$-th term in this sequence is the number of length-$n$ binary words that avoid $110$. This paper proves a related but new interpretation: given a length-$3$ binary word -- called the keyword -- we say two length-$n$ binary words are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by some sequence of substitutions: each substitution replaces an instance of the keyword with its negation, or vice versa. We prove that the number of induced equivalence classes is again the $n$-th term in the aforementioned sequence. When the keyword has length $m+1$ (instead of $3$), the same result holds with $m$-step Fibonacci numbers. What makes this result surprising -- and distinct from the previous interpretation -- is that it does not depend on the keyword, despite the fact that the sizes of the equivalence classes do. On this final point, we prove several results on the structure of equivalence classes, and also pose a variety of open problems.</description>

      <title>Maximal determinants of matrices over the roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximum absolute value of the determinant of matrices with entries in the set of $\ell$-th roots of unity; this is a generalization of $D$-optimal designs and Hadamard's maximal determinant problem, which involves $\pm 1$ matrices. For general values of $\ell$, we give sharpened determinantal upper bounds and constructions of matrices of large determinant. The maximal determinant problem in the cases $\ell = 3$, $\ell = 4$ is similar to the classical Hadamard maximal determinant problem for matrices with entries $\pm 1$, and many techniques can be generalized. For $\ell = 3$ we give an additional construction of matrices with large determinant, and calculate the value of the maximal determinant over $\mu_3$ for all orders $n &lt; 14$. Additionally, we survey the case $\ell = 4$ and exhibit an infinite family of maximal determinant matrices over the fourth roots of unity.</description>

      <title>More on the full Brouwer Laplacian spectrum conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brouwer conjectured that the sum of the first $k$ largest Laplacian eigenvalues of an $n$-vertex graph is less than or equal to the number of its edges plus $\binom{k+1}{2}$ for each $k\in \{1,2,\cdots,n\}$, which has come to be known as Brouwer's conjecture. Recently, Li and Guo further considered the case when the equalities hold in these conjectured inequalities, and proposed the full version of Brouwer's conjecture. In this paper, we first present a concise version of the full Brouwer's conjecture. Then we show that the full Brouwer's conjecture holds for two families of spanning subgraphs of complete split graphs and for $c$-cyclic graphs with $c\in\{0,1,2\}$. We also consider the Nordhaus-Gaddum version of the full Brouwer's conjecture and present partial solutions to it.</description>

      <title>Characterizing forbidden pairs for spanning $\varTheta$-subgraphs of 2-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a set of connected graphs, and let $G$ be a graph. We say that $G$ is \emph{$\mathcal{F}$-free} if it does not contain $F$ as an induced subgraph for all $F\in\mathcal{F}$, and we call $\mathcal{F}$ a forbidden pair if $|\mathcal{F}|=2$. A \emph{$\varTheta$-graph} is the graph consisting of three internally disjoint paths with the same pair of end-vertices. If the $\varTheta$-subgraph $T$ contains all vertices of $G$, then we call $T$ a \emph{spanning $\varTheta$-subgraph} of $G$. In this paper, we characterize all pairs of connected graphs $R,S$ such that every 2-connected $\{R,S\}$-free graph has a spanning $\varTheta$-subgraph. In order to obtain this result, we also characterize all minimal 2-connected non-cycle claw-free graphs without spanning $\varTheta$-subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Betti number estimates for non-negatively curved graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Betti number estimates for graphs with non-negative Ollivier curvature, and for graphs with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature, providing a discrete analogue of a classical result by Bochner for manifolds. Specifically, we show that for graphs with non-negative Ollivier curvature, the first Betti number is bounded above by half of the minimum combinatorial vertex degree. In contrast, for graphs with non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we prove that the first Betti number of the path homology is bounded above by the minimum combinatorial vertex degree minus one. We further present various rigidity results, characterizing graphs that attain the upper bound on the first Betti number under non-negative Ollivier curvature. Remarkably, these graphs are precisely the discrete tori, similar to the Riemannian setting. Furthermore, we show that the results obtained using the Ollivier curvature extend to the setting of potentially non-reversible Markov chains. Additionally, we explore rigidity cases depending on the idleness parameter of the Ollivier curvature, i.e., we characterize rigidity for bone-idle graphs with non-negative Ollivier curvature that attain the upper Betti number bound. We further establish an upper bound on the first Betti number under a more general assumption, where non-negative Ollivier curvature is required only outside a finite subset. Finally, we provide several examples, e.g., we prove that for a potentially non-reversible Markov chain on a cycle of length at least five, there always exists a unique path metric with constant Ollivier curvature. Moreover, this metric has non-negative Ollivier curvature, and the upper Betti number bound is attained if and only if the curvature is zero.</description>

      <title>Marked multi-colorings, partially commutative Lie superalgebras and right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebras, particularly Borcherds-Kac-Moody (BKM) superalgebras, play a fundamental role in mathematical physics, number theory, and representation theory. In this paper, we study the root multiplicities of BKM superalgebras via their denominator identities, deriving explicit combinatorial formulas in terms of graph invariants associated with marked (quasi) Dynkin diagrams. We introduce partially commutative Lie superalgebras (PCLSAs) and provide a direct combinatorial proof of their denominator identity, where the generating set runs over the super heaps monoid. A key notation in our approach is marked multi-colorings and their associated polynomials, which generalize chromatic polynomials and offer a method for computing root multiplicities. As applications, we characterize the roots of PCLSAs and establish connections between their universal enveloping algebras and right-angled Coxeter groups, leading to explicit formulas for their Hilbert series. These results further deepen the interplay between Lie superalgebras, graph theory, and algebraic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Universality of the matching number in percolated regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a sequence of $d$-regular graphs $(G_d)_{d\in \mathbb{N}}$ and denote by $G_{d,p}$ the graph obtained from $G_d$ after edge-percolation with probability $p=c/d$, for a constant $c&gt;0$. We prove a quantitative local convergence of $(G_{d,p})_{d\in \mathbb{N}}$. In combination with results of Bordenave, Lelarge and Salez, it implies that the rescaled matching number of $G_{d,p}$ is asymptotically equivalent to that of the binomial random graph $G(n,c/n)$.</description>

      <title>Sorting permutations with pile shuffle on queue-like and stack-like piles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a common technique for shuffling a deck of cards on a table without riffling, we formalize the pile shuffle and investigate its capabilities as a sorting device. Our study is novel in that we consider pile shuffle in three variations: (1) using queue-like piles, (2) using stack-like piles, and (3) using a heterogeneous mixture of those two pile types, either given or decided during the shuffle by the dealer herself. We first characterize the sortable permutations of one or more sequential rounds of pile shuffle, under constraints on the number and types of piles to be used, and then derive formulas to obtain a sorting shuffle of a given permutation on the minimum number of piles, efficiently, whenever feasible. In the process, we present an interesting mathematical interpretation of any multi-round shuffle on fixed-type piles, as a single-round shuffle on a generally larger number of fixed-type ``virtual piles''; we confirm that repetition augments the power of pile shuffle exponentially, in that $m$ piles over $T$ rounds enjoys the capacity of $m^T$ piles in a single round. Finally, we motivate a forthcoming companion paper in which we prove that dealer choice -- where the dealer is allowed to choose the types of the piles during the shuffle -- makes deciding feasibility of sort NP-Hard for some variants of multi-round pile shuffle; proof is by a novel reduction from Boolean satisfiability (SAT).</description>

      <title>The saturation number of W 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed graph $H$, a graph $G$ is called $H$-saturated if $G$ does not contain $H$ as a (not necessarily induced) subgraph, but $G+e$ contains a copy of $H$ for any $e\in E(\overline{G})$. The saturation number of $H$, denoted by ${\rm sat}(n,H)$, is the minimum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-saturated graph. A wheel $W_n$ is a graph obtained from a cycle of length $n$ by adding a new vertex and joining it to every vertex of the cycle. A well-known result of Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal and Moon shows that ${\rm sat}(n,W_3)=2n-3$ for all $n\geq 4$ and $K_2\vee \overline{K_{n-2}}$ is the unique extremal graph, where $\vee$ denotes the graph join operation. In this paper, we study the saturation number of $W_4$. We prove that ${\rm sat}(n,W_4)=\lfloor\frac{5n-10}{2}\rfloor$ for all $n\geq 6$ and give a complete characterization of the extremal graphs.</description>

      <title>Matrix Scaling: a New Heuristic for the Feedback Vertex Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a digraph $G$, a set $F\subseteq V(G)$ is said to be a feedback vertex set (FVS) if $G-F$ is acyclic. The problem of finding a smallest FVS is NP-hard. We present a matrix scaling technique for finding feedback vertex sets in un-weighted directed graphs that runs in $O(|F|\log(|V|)|V|^{2})$ time. Our technique is empirically shown to produce smaller feedback vertex sets than other known heuristics and in a shorter amount of time.</description>

Abstract: We investigate some weighted integer partitions whose generating functions are double-series. We will establish closed formulas for these $q$-double series and deduce that their coefficients are non-negative. This leads to inequalities among integer partitions.</description>

      <title>Normal and non-normal Cayley digraphs on cyclic and dihedral groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Cayley digraph on a group $G$ is called NNN if the Cayley digraph is normal and its automorphism group contains a non-normal regular subgroup isomorphic to $G$. A group is called NNND-group or NNN-group if there is an NNN Cayley digraph or graph on the group, respectively. In this paper, it is shown that there is no cyclic NNND-group, and hence no cyclic NNN-group. Furthermore, a dihedral group of order $2n$ is an NNND-group or an NNN-group if and only if $n\ge 6$ is even and $n\not=8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of the LLM-driven genetic algorithm {\it funsearch}, whose aim is to generate examples of interest to mathematicians and which has already had some success in problems in extremal combinatorics. Our implementation is designed to be useful in practice for working mathematicians; it does not require expertise in machine learning or access to high-performance computing resources. Applying {\it funsearch} to a new problem involves modifying a small segment of Python code and selecting a large language model (LLM) from one of many third-party providers. We benchmarked our implementation on three different problems, obtaining metrics that may inform applications of {\it funsearch} to new problems. Our results demonstrate that {\it funsearch} successfully learns in a variety of combinatorial and number-theoretic settings, and in some contexts learns principles that generalize beyond the problem originally trained on.</description>

Abstract: Tropical caustic of a convex domain on the plane is a canonically associated tropical analytic curve inside the domain. In this note we give a graphical proof for the classification of its intermediate vertices, implying in particular that they are always trivalent. Apart from that we explain how various known examples of tropical caustics are constructed and discuss the possibility of relaxing the convexity condition for the domain.</description>

      <title>Permutation Equivariant Neural Networks for Symmetric Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating permutation equivariance into neural networks has proven to be useful in ensuring that models respect symmetries that exist in data. Symmetric tensors, which naturally appear in statistics, machine learning, and graph theory, are essential for many applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science, amongst others. However, existing research on permutation equivariant models has not explored symmetric tensors as inputs, and most prior work on learning from these tensors has focused on equivariance to Euclidean groups. In this paper, we present two different characterisations of all linear permutation equivariant functions between symmetric power spaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show on two tasks that these functions are highly data efficient compared to standard MLPs and have potential to generalise well to symmetric tensors of different sizes.</description>

      <title>Edge ideals with linear quotients and without homological linear quotients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A monomial ideal $I$ is said to have homological linear quotients if for each $k\geq 0$, the homological shift ideal $\mathrm{HS}_k(I)$ has linear quotients. It is a well-known fact that if an edge ideal $I(G)$ has homological linear quotients, then $G$ is co-chordal. We construct a family of co-chordal graphs $\{\mathrm{H}_n^c\}_{n\geq 6}$ and propose a conjecture that an edge ideal $I(G)$ has homological linear quotients if and only if $G$ is co-chordal and $\mathrm{H}_n^c$-free for any $n\geq 6$. In this paper, we prove one direction of the conjecture. Moreover, we study possible patterns of pairs $(G,k)$ of a co-chordal graph $G$ and integer $k$ such that $\mathrm{HS}_k(I(G))$ has linear quotients.</description>

      <title>A Generalized RSK for Enumerating Linear Series on $n$-pointed Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial proof of a recent geometric result of Farkas and Lian on linear series on curves with prescribed incidence conditions. The result states that the expected number of degree-$d$ morphisms from a general genus $g$, $n$-marked curve $C$ to $\mathbb{P}^r$, sending the marked points on $C$ to specified general points in $\mathbb{P}^r$, is equal to $(r+1)^g$ for sufficiently large $d$. This computation may be rephrased as an intersection problem on Grassmannians, which has a natural combinatorial interpretation in terms of Young tableaux by the classical Littlewood-Richardson rule. We give a bijection, generalizing the well-known RSK correspondence, between the tableaux in question and the $(r+1)$-ary sequences of length $g$, and we explore our bijection's combinatorial properties.
  We also apply similar methods to give a combinatorial interpretation and proof of the fact that, in the modified setting in which $r=1$ and several marked points map to the same point in $\mathbb{P}^1$, the number of morphisms is still $2^g$ for sufficiently large $d$.</description>

      <title>A Caro-Wei bound for induced linear forests in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known result due to Caro (1979) and Wei (1981) states that every graph $G$ has an independent set of size at least $\sum_{v\in V(G)} \frac{1}{d(v) + 1}$, where $d(v)$ denotes the degree of vertex $v$. Alon, Kahn, and Seymour (1987) showed the following generalization: For every $k\geq 0$, every graph $G$ has a $k$-degenerate induced subgraph with at least $\sum_{v \in V(G)}\min\{1, \frac {k+1}{d(v)+1}\}$ vertices. In particular, for $k=1$, every graph $G$ with no isolated vertices has an induced forest with at least $\sum_{v\in V(G)} \frac{2}{d(v) + 1}$ vertices. Akbari, Amanihamedani, Mousavi, Nikpey, and Sheybani (2019) conjectured that, if $G$ has minimum degree at least $2$, then one can even find an induced linear forest of that order in $G$, that is, a forest where each component is a path.
  In this paper, we prove this conjecture and show a number of related results. In particular, if there is no restriction on the minimum degree of $G$, we show that there are infinitely many ``best possible'' functions $f$ such that $\sum_{v\in V(G)} f(d(v))$ is a lower bound on the maximum order of a linear forest in $G$, and we give a full characterization of all such functions $f$.</description>

      <title>The Defective Parking Space and Defective Kreweras Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A defective $(m,n)$-parking function with defect $d$ is a parking function with $m$ cars attempting to park on a street with $n$ parking spots in which exactly $d$ cars fail to park. We establish a way to compute the defect of a defective $(m,n)$-parking function and show that the defect of a parking function is invariant under the action of $\mathfrak{S}_m$, the symmetric group on $[m]=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$. We introduce the defective parking space ${{\sf DPark}}_{m,n}$ spanned by defective parking functions and describe its Frobenius characteristic as an $\mathfrak{S}_m$ representation graded by defect via coefficients $\mathrm{Krew}_{d,n}(\lambda)$ called defective Kreweras numbers. We provide a conjectured formula for $\mathrm{Krew}_{d,n}(\lambda)$ for sufficiently large $n$. We also show that the set of nondecreasing defective $(m,n)$-parking functions with defect $d$ are in bijection with the set of standard Young tableaux of shape $(n + d, m - d)$. This implies that the number of $\mathfrak{S}_m$-orbits of defective $(m,n)$-parking functions with defect $d$ is given by $\frac{n-m+2d+1}{n+d+1}\binom{m+n}{n+d}$. We also give a multinomial formula for the size of an $\mathfrak{S}_m$-orbit of a nondecreasing $(m,n)$-parking function with defect $d$. We conclude by using these results to give a new formula for the number of defective parking functions.</description>

This resolves a question of Liu, Norin and Wood [arXiv:2410.20333]. We also show this result is best possible: for any $c \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a planar graph $G$ such that for any tree $T$ and graph $H$ with $\text{tw}(H) \leqslant 2$, $G$ is not contained in $H \boxtimes T \boxtimes K_c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Kita--Yoshida and Cho--Matsumoto introduced intersection forms on the twisted (co)homologies of hyperplane arrangement complements. We give a closed combinatorial formula for these intersection pairings. We show that these intersection pairings are obtained from (continuous and discrete) Laplace transforms of subfans of the Bergman fan of the associated matroid. We compute inverses of these intersection pairings, allowing us to identify (variants of) these intersection forms with the contravariant form of Schechtman--Varchenko, and the bilinear form of Varchenko.
  Building on parallel joint work with C. Eur, we define a notion of scattering amplitudes for matroids. We show that matroid amplitudes satisfy locality and unitarity, and recover biadjoint scalar amplitudes in the case of the complete graphic matroid. We apply our formulae for twisted intersection forms to deduce old and new formulae for scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: For a matroid of rank $r$ and a non-negative integer $k$, an element is called $k$-loose if every circuit containing it has size greater than $r-k$. Zaslavsky and the author characterized all binary matroids with a $1$-loose element. In this paper, we establish a sharp linear bound on the size of a binary matroid, in terms of its rank, that contains a $k$-loose element. A matroid is called $k$-paving if all its elements are $k$-loose. Rajpal showed that for a prime power $q$, the rank of a $GF(q)$-matroid that is $k$-paving is bounded. We provide a bound on the rank of $GF(q)$-matroids that are cosimple and have two $k$-loose elements. Consequently, we deduce a bound on the rank of $GF(q)$-matroids that are $k$-paving. Additionally, we provide a bound on the size of binary matroids that are $k$-paving.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of ascent and descent distributions on rectangular and staircase tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give direct bijective proofs of the symmetry of the distributions of the number of ascents and descents over standard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is a rectangle $(n,n,\dots,n)$ or a truncated staircase $(n,n-1,\dots,n-k+1)$. These can be viewed as instances of the more general symmetry of the distribution of descents over linear extensions of graded posets, for which previous proofs by Stanley and Farley were based on the theory of $P$-partitions and the involution principle, respectively. In the case of two-row rectangles $(n,n)$, our bijection is equivalent to the Lalanne--Kreweras involution on Dyck paths, which bijectively proves the symmetry of the Narayana numbers.
  Our bijections are defined in terms of certain arrow encodings of standard Young tableaux. This setup allows us to construct other statistic-preserving involutions on tableaux of rectangular shape, providing a simple proof of the fact that ascents and descents are equidistributed up to a shift, and proving a conjecture of Sulanke about certain statistics in the case of three rows. Finally, we use our bijections to define a possible notion of rowmotion on standard Young tableaux of rectangular shape, and to give a bijective proof of the symmetry of the number of descents on canon permutations, which have been recently studied as a variation of Stirling and quasi-Stirling permutations.</description>

Abstract: For a graph $G$, its spectral radius $\rho(G)$ is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite family of graphs with $\min_{F\in \mathcal{F}}\chi(F)=r+1\geq3$, where $\chi(F)$ is the chromatic number of $F$. Set $t=\max_{F\in\mathcal{F}}|F|$. Let $T(rt,r)$ be the Tur\'{a}n graph of order $rt$ with $r$ parts. Assume that some $F_{0}\subseteq\mathcal{F}$ is a subgraph of the graph obtained from $T(rt,r)$ by embedding a path or a matching in one part. Let ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ be the set of graphs with the maximum number of edges among all the graphs of order $n$ containing not any $F\in\mathcal{F}$. Simonovits \cite{S1,S2} gave general results on the graphs in ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{F})$. Let ${\rm SPEX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ be the set of graphs with the maximum spectral radius among all the graphs of order $n$ containing not any $F\in\mathcal{F}$. Motivated by the work of Simonovits, we characterize the specified structure of the graphs in ${\rm SPEX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ in this paper. Moreover, some applications are also included.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Alternating Sums of Parts in Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, many authors have investigated how various partition statistics distribute as the size of the partition grows. In this work, we look at a particular statistic arising from the recent rejuvenation of MacMahon's partition analysis. More specifically, we compute all the moments of the alternating sum statistic for partitions. We prove this results using the Circle Method. We also propose a general framework for studying further questions of this type that may avoid some of the complications that arise in traditional approaches to the distributions of partition statistics, and we comment on the utility, comparative ease and opportunities to generalize to very broad settings.</description>

      <title>Maximum number of points in general position in a random subset of finite $3$-dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^{d},p)$ be the maximum possible size of a point set in general position in the $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. In this note, we determine the order of magnitude of $\alpha(\mathbb{F}_q^{3},p)$ up to a polylogarithmic factor by proving a balanced supersaturation result for the sets of $4$ points in the same plane.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Number of Pieces in Continuous Piecewise Affine Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of continuous piecewise affine (CPA) functions can be measured by the number of pieces $p$ or the number of distinct affine functions $n$. For CPA functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, this paper shows an upper bound of $p=O(n^{d+1})$ and constructs a family of functions achieving a lower bound of $p=\Omega(n^{d+1-\frac{c}{\sqrt{\log_2(n)}}})$.</description>

      <title>Singular matroid realization spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study smoothness of realization spaces of matroids for small rank and ground set. For $\mathbb{C}$-realizable matroids, when the rank is $3$, we prove that the realization spaces are all smooth when the ground set has $11$ or fewer elements, and there are singular realization spaces for $12$ and greater elements. For rank $4$ and $9$ or fewer elements, we prove that these realization spaces are smooth. As an application, we prove that $\text{Gr}^{\circ}(3,n;\mathbb{C})$ -- the locus of the Grassmannian where all Pl\"ucker coordinates are nonzero -- is not sch\"on for $n\geq 12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of dense kernel-based random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based random graphs (KBRGs) are a broad class of random graph models that account for inhomogeneity among vertices. We consider KBRGs on a discrete $d-$dimensional torus $\mathbf{V}_N$ of size $N^d$. Conditionally on an i.i.d.~sequence of {Pareto} weights $(W_i)_{i\in \mathbf{V}_N}$ with tail exponent $\tau-1&gt;0$, we connect any two points $i$ and $j$ on the torus with probability
  $$p_{ij}= \frac{\kappa_{\sigma}(W_i,W_j)}{\|i-j\|^{\alpha}} \wedge 1$$ for some parameter $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\kappa_{\sigma}(u,v)= (u\vee v)(u \wedge v)^{\sigma}$ for some $\sigma\in(0,\tau-1)$.
  We focus on the adjacency operator of this random graph and study its empirical spectral distribution. For $\alpha&lt;d$ and $\tau&gt;2$, we show that a non-trivial limiting distribution exists as $N\to\infty$ and that the corresponding measure $\mu_{\sigma,\tau}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. $\mu_{\sigma,\tau}$ is given by an operator-valued semicircle law, whose Stieltjes transform is characterised by a fixed point equation in an appropriate Banach space. We analyse the moments of $\mu_{\sigma,\tau}$ and prove that the second moment is finite even when the weights have infinite variance. In the case $\sigma=1$, corresponding to the so-called scale-free percolation random graph, we can explicitly describe the limiting measure and study its tail.</description>

      <title>The GroebnerWalk.jl package for OSCAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing Gr\"obner bases is known to have a very high upper bound on computation time with respect to input length. Due to the connection between polyhedral geometry and Gr\"obner bases through the Gr\"obner fan, one can attempt an incremental approach to compute Gr\"obner bases. First computing a Gr\"obner basis with respect to an `easy' term order and transforming that result to a Gr\"obner basis with respect to the desired term order by using information about this polyhedral fan is done by a family of algorithms termed as Gr\"obner walk. We implemented two variants of the Gr\"obner walk in the computer algebra system OSCAR and compared their performance with classical Gr\"obner basis methods already found in OSCAR.</description>
