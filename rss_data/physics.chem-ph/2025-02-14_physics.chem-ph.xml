      <title>A Guide to Molecular Properties from the Bethe-Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) combined with the Green's function GW method has successfully transformed into a robust computational tool to describe light-matter interactions and excitation spectra for molecules, solids, and materials from first principles. Thanks to its ability to accurately describe charge-transfer and Rydberg excitations, the GW-BSE already forms an established and cost-efficient alternative to time-dependent density functional theory. This raises the question whether the GW-BSE approach can become a more general framework for molecular properties beyond excitation energies. In this mini-review, we recapitulate recent endeavors along this point in terms of both theoretical and practical developments for quantum chemistry, physical chemistry, and related fields. In doing so, we provide guidelines for current applications to chemical challenges in collaboration with experimentalists as well as to future developments to extended the GW-BSE toolkit.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Quantum Chemistry for Accurate Negative Singlet-Triplet Gap Predictions: A Case for Double-Hybrid DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecules that violate Hund's rule -- having first excited singlet state (S$_1$) below the triplet state (T$_1$) -- are rare yet promising as efficient light emitters. Their high-throughput identification demands exceptionally accurate excited-state modeling to minimize false positives and negatives. Benchmarking twelve S$_1$-T$_1$ energy gaps, we find that local variants of ADC(2) and CC2 deliver excellent accuracy and speed for screening medium-sized molecules. Notably, while double-hybrid DFT approximations (e.g., B2GP-PLYP and PBE-QIDH) exhibit high mean errors ($&gt;100$ meV) despite very low standard deviations ($\approx10$ meV), exploring their parameter space reveals that a configuration with 75% exchange and 55% correlation reduces the mean error to below $5$ meV -- albeit with increased variance. Using this low-bias parameterization as an internal reference, we correct the systematic error while maintaining low variance, effectively combining the strengths of both low-bias and low-variance DFT parameterizations to enhance overall accuracy. Our findings suggest that low-variance DFT methods -- often overlooked due to high bias -- can serve as reliable tools for predictive modeling in first-principles molecular design.</description>

      <title>Convex envelope method for T, p flash calculations for chemical systems with an arbitrary number of components and arbitrary aggregate states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T, p flash calculations determine the correct number of phases at phase equilibrium and their compositions for fixed temperature and pressure. They are essential for chemical process simulation and optimization. The convex envelope method (CEM) is an existing approach that employs the tangent plane criterion to determine liquid phase equilibria for chemical systems with an arbitrary number of components without providing the number of phases beforehand. This work extends the CEM to include also vapor and solid phases. Thus, any phase equilibrium of a given system with an arbitrary number of components and phases can be calculated over the whole composition space. The CEM results are presented for various vapor-liquid and solid-liquid phase equilibria examples of up to four components. We show how the CEM can be used for parameter fitting of gE-models. As an outlook, we demonstrate how the CEM can be combined with a machine learning-based tool for property prediction to construct phase equilibria.</description>

      <title>Shadow Molecular Dynamics for a Charge-Potential Equilibration Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a shadow molecular dynamics (MD) approach based on the Atom-Condensed Kohn-Sham second-order (ACKS2) charge-potential equilibration model. In contrast to regular flexible charge models, the ACKS2 model includes both flexible atomic charges and potential fluctuation parameters that allow for physically correct charge fragmentation and scaling of the polarizability. Our shadow MD scheme is based on an approximation of the ACKS2's flexible charge-potential energy function, in combination with extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer MD. Utilizing this shadow charge-potential equilibration approach mitigates the costly overhead and stability problems associated with finding well-converged iterative solutions to the charges and potential fluctuations of the ACKS2 model in an MD simulation. Our work provides a robust and versatile framework for efficient, high-fidelity MD simulations of diverse physical phenomena and applications.</description>

      <title>Universal criterion for selective outcomes under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resetting plays a pivotal role in optimizing the completion time of complex first passage processes with single or multiple outcomes/exit possibilities. While it is well established that the coefficient of variation -- a statistical dispersion defined as a ratio of the fluctuations over the mean of the first passage time -- must be larger than unity for resetting to be beneficial for any outcome averaged over all the possibilities, the same can not be said while conditioned on a particular outcome. The purpose of this letter is to derive a universal condition which reveals that two statistical metric -- the mean and coefficient of variation of the conditional times -- come together to determine when resetting can expedite the completion of a selective outcome, and furthermore can govern the biasing between preferential and non-preferential outcomes. The universality of this result is demonstrated for a one dimensional diffusion process subjected to resetting with two absorbing boundaries.</description>

      <title>NextGenPB: an analytically-enabled super resolution and local (de)refinement Poisson-Boltzmann Equation solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) is a relevant partial differential equation commonly used in biophysical applications to estimate the electrostatic energy of biomolecular systems immersed in electrolytic solutions. A conventional mean to improve the accuracy of its solution, when grid-based numerical techniques are used, consists in increasing the resolution, locally or globally. This, however, usually entails higher complexity, memory demand and computational cost. Here, we introduce NextGenPB, a linear PBE, adaptive-grid, FEM solver that leverages analytical calculations to maximize the accuracy-to-computational-cost ratio. Indeed, in NextGenPB (aka NGPB), analytical corrections at the surface of the solute enhance the solution's accuracy without requiring grid adaptation. This leads to more precise estimates of the electrostatic potential, fields, and energy at no perceptible additional cost. Also, we apply computationally efficient yet accurate boundary conditions by taking advantage of local grid de-refinement. To assess the accuracy of our methods directly, we expand the traditionally available analytical case set to many non-overlapping dielectric spheres. Then, we use an existing benchmark set of real biomolecular systems to evaluate the energy convergence concerning grid resolution. Thanks to these advances, we have improved state-of-the-art results and shown that the approach is accurate and largely scalable for modern high-performance computing architectures. Lastly, we suggest that the presented core ideas could be instrumental in improving the solution of other partial differential equations with discontinuous coefficients.</description>

      <title>MDCrow: Automating Molecular Dynamics Workflows with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding biomolecular systems but remain challenging to automate. Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have demonstrated success in automating complex scientific tasks using LLM-based agents. In this paper, we introduce MDCrow, an agentic LLM assistant capable of automating MD workflows. MDCrow uses chain-of-thought over 40 expert-designed tools for handling and processing files, setting up simulations, analyzing the simulation outputs, and retrieving relevant information from literature and databases. We assess MDCrow's performance across 25 tasks of varying required subtasks and difficulty, and we evaluate the agent's robustness to both difficulty and prompt style. \texttt{gpt-4o} is able to complete complex tasks with low variance, followed closely by \texttt{llama3-405b}, a compelling open-source model. While prompt style does not influence the best models' performance, it has significant effects on smaller models.</description>

      <title>Reactive path ensembles within nonequilibrium steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modern theory of rare events is grounded in near equilibrium ideas, however many systems of modern interest are sufficiently far from equilibrium that traditional approaches do not apply. Using the recently developed variational path sampling methodology, we study systems evolving within nonequilibrium steady states to elucidate how reactive processes are altered away from equilibrium. Variational path sampling provides access to ensembles of reactive events, and a means of quantifying the relative importance of each dynamical degree of freedom in such processes. With it, we have studied the conformational change of a solute in an active bath. We illustrate how energy injection generically enhances the rates of rare events, even when energy is not directed into specific reactive modes. By studying the folding and unfolding transitions of a grafted polymer under shear, we illustrate how nonequilibrium reactive processes do not follow gradient paths due to the emergence of persistent currents. The breaking of detailed balance allows for the mechanisms of forward and backward reactions to be distinct, enabling novel pathways to be explored and designed, and states unstable in equilibrium to become stabilized kinetically away from it. The analysis presented in this work establishes some basic principles for nonequilibrium reactive events, and is made possible by the use of a numerical method that does not invoke proximity to equilibrium or requires strong prior assumptions about the mechanism of reaction.</description>

      <title>Capturing spin chain dynamics with periodically projected time-dependent basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating many-body quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the large size of the state space. To address this issue, we propose using an SU(2) coherent state for individual spins to simulate spins on a lattice and derive equations of motion based on the variational principle. This method involves a sampling approach, where a subset of relevant configurations is chosen based on energy criteria, and a projection method is used to remove linear dependency on the overcomplete and time-dependent basis during propagation. We validate this method through numerical simulations of up to seven-qubit system, calculating key physical observables such as state probabilities and domain-wall densities. Our results indicate that while complete basis sets offer accurate dynamics, selected incomplete sets can recover essential features, especially with the assistance of a projector. The selected incomplete dual bases method is not limited by the structure of Hamiltonian and efficiently captures the non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>WGFormer: An SE(3)-Transformer Driven by Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Molecular Ground-State Conformation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09795v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting molecular ground-state conformation (i.e., energy-minimized conformation) is crucial for many chemical applications such as molecular docking and property prediction. Classic energy-based simulation is time-consuming when solving this problem while existing learning-based methods have advantages in computational efficiency but sacrifice accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel and effective method to bridge the energy-based simulation and the learning-based strategy, which designs and learns a Wasserstein gradient flow-driven SE(3)-Transformer, called WGFormer, for molecular ground-state conformation prediction. Specifically, our method tackles this task within an auto-encoding framework, which encodes low-quality conformations by the proposed WGFormer and decodes corresponding ground-state conformations by an MLP. The architecture of WGFormer corresponds to Wasserstein gradient flows -- it optimizes molecular conformations by minimizing an energy function defined on the latent mixture models of atoms, thereby significantly improving performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, providing a new and insightful paradigm to predict molecular ground-state conformation.</description>

      <title>Intensities of all fine-structure resolved rovibrational electric quadrupole absorption lines in $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$) calculated with a new $\textit{ab initio}$ quadrupole moment curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intensities of all rovibrational electric quadrupole absorption lines in $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$), for which the vibrational quantum number is $v \leq 35$ and the total angular momentum quantum number is $J \leq 40$, are calculated in the intermediate coupling using a new $\textit{ab initio}$ quadrupole moment curve of the ground electronic state of O$_2$. The calculated values agree with those available in the HITRAN database, which at present includes only the $1$-$0$ fundamental vibrational band of $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$). We therefore recommend using the intensities of the vibrational overtones and hot bands reported here in updating the HITRAN database for O$_2$ in the upcoming 2024 edition.</description>
