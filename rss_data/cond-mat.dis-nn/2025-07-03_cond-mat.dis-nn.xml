      <title>The principle of least action for random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the physical action $S$ for random graphs, by treating the number of neighbors at each vertex of the graph (degree), as a scalar field. For each configuration (run) of the graph we calculate the Lagrangian of the degree field by using a lattice quantum field theory(LQFT) approach. Then the corresponding action is calculated by integrating the Lagrangian over all the vertices of the graph. We implement an evolution mechanism for the graph by removing one edge per a fundamental quantum of time, resulting in different evolution paths based on the run that is chosen at each evolution step. We calculate the action along each of these evolution paths, which allows us to calculate the probability distribution of $S$. We find that the distribution approaches the normal(Gaussian) form as the graph becomes denser, by adding more edges between its vertices. The maximum of the probability distribution of the action corresponds to graph configurations whose spacing between the values of $S$ becomes zero $\Delta S=0$, corresponding to the least-action (Hamilton) principle, which gives the path that the physical system follows classically. In addition, we calculate the fluctuations(variance) of the degree field showing that the graph configurations corresponding to the maximum probability of $S$, which follow the Hamilton's principle, have a balanced structure between regular and irregular graphs.</description>

      <title>Wilson Line and Disorder Invariants of Topological One-Dimensional Multiband Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological invariants, such as the winding number, the Chern number, and the Zak phase, characterize the topological phases of bulk materials. Through the bulk-boundary correspondence, these topological phases have a one-to-one correspondence to topological edge states, which are robust to certain classes of disorder. For simple models like the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the computation of the winding number and Zak phase are straightforward, however, in multiband systems, this is no longer the case. In this work, we introduce the unwrapped Wilson line across the Brillouin zone to compute the bulk topological invariant. This method can efficiently be implemented numerically to evaluate multiband SSH-type models, including models that have a large number of distinct topological phases. This approach accurately captures all topological edge states, including those overlooked by traditional invariants, such as the winding number and Zak phase. To make a connection to experiments, we determine the sign of the topological invariant by considering a Hall-like configuration. We further introduce different classes of disorder that leave certain edge states protected, while suppressing other edge states, depending on their symmetry properties. Our approach is illustrated using different one-dimensional models, providing a robust framework for understanding topological properties in one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>STEM Diffraction Pattern Analysis with Deep Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate grain orientation mapping is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of polycrystalline materials, particularly in energy-related applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its electrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated, using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural characterization.</description>

      <title>Proof of a perfect platonic representation hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD, two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid lengthy technical details.</description>

      <title>Harnessing coherent-wave control for sensing applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) achieve deep, non-invasive sensing in turbid media, but they are constrained by the photon budget. Wavefront shaping (WFS) can enhance signal strength via interference at specific locations within scattering media, enhancing light-matter interactions and potentially extending the penetration depth of these techniques. Interpreting the resulting measurements rests on the knowledge of optical sensitivity - a relationship between detected signal changes and perturbations at a specific location inside the medium. However, conventional diffusion-based sensitivity models rely on assumptions that become invalid under coherent illumination. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory for optical sensitivity that captures the inherent interference effects that diffusion theory necessarily neglects. We analytically show that under random illumination, the microscopic and diffusive treatments coincide. Using our microscopic approach, we explore WFS strategies for enhancing optical sensitivity beyond the diffusive result. We demonstrate that the input state obtained through phase conjugation at a given point inside the system leads to the largest enhancement of optical sensitivity but requires an input wavefront that depends on the target position. In sharp contrast, the maximum remission eigenchannel leads to a global enhancement of the sensitivity map with a fixed input wavefront. This global enhancement equals to remission enhancement and preserves the spatial distribution of the sensitivity, making it compatible with existing DOT reconstruction algorithms. Our results establish the theoretical foundation for integrating wavefront control with diffuse optical imaging, enabling deeper tissue penetration through improved signal strength in biomedical applications.</description>

Abstract: Computing the ground state of interacting quantum matter is a long-standing challenge, especially for complex two-dimensional systems. Recent developments have highlighted the potential of neural quantum states to solve the quantum many-body problem by encoding the many-body wavefunction into artificial neural networks. However, this method has faced the critical limitation that existing optimization algorithms are not suitable for training modern large-scale deep network architectures. Here, we introduce a minimum-step stochastic-reconfiguration optimization algorithm, which allows us to train deep neural quantum states with up to $10^6$ parameters. We demonstrate our method for paradigmatic frustrated spin-1/2 models on square and triangular lattices, for which our trained deep networks approach machine precision and yield improved variational energies compared to existing results. Equipped with our optimization algorithm, we find numerical evidence for gapless quantum-spin-liquid phases in the considered models, an open question to date. We present a method that captures the emergent complexity in quantum many-body problems through the expressive power of large-scale artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Re-entrant localization induced by short-range hopping in the fractal Rosenzweig-Porter Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typically, metallic systems localized under strong disorder exhibit a transition to \imk{delocalization} %finite conduction as kinetic terms increase. In this work, we reveal the opposite effect~--~increasing kinetic terms leads to an unexpected \imk{reduction of mobility, }%suppression of conductivity, enhancing localization of the system, and even lead to re-entrant delocalization transitions. Specifically, we add a nearest-neighbor hopping with amplitude \(\kappa\) to the Rosenzweig-Porter (RP) model with fractal on-site disorder and surprisingly see that, as \(\kappa\) grows, the system initially tends to localization from the fractal phase, but then re-enters the ergodic phase. We build an analytical framework to explain this re-entrant behavior, supported by exact diagonalization results. The interplay between the spatially local $\kappa$ term, insensitive to fractal disorder, and the energy-local RP coupling, sensitive to fine-level spacing structure, drives the observed re-entrant behavior. This mechanism offers a novel pathway to re-entrant localization phenomena in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Generalization performance of narrow one-hidden layer networks in the teacher-student setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.</description>

      <title>A Replica-BCS theory for dirty superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14914v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of dirty superconductors using a replica-symmetric BCS (RS-BCS) theory. We apply the RS-BCS theory to dirty superconductor grains of size $L^d$, where $L$ is the localization length and $d$ is the dimension of the system, assuming that the macroscopic system is composed of weakly coupled grains. Besides disordered potential, We also consider the case where regions with opposite signs of interaction exist in the grains, with net attractive interaction between electrons. Within the RS-BCS mean field theory, the system phase diagram, single-particle tunneling density of states and the superfluid density are computed within the RS-BCS theory for different strengths of disorder, We show that our result agrees qualitatively with previous numerical studies in the case with pure attractive interaction, and that a Cooper-pair-glass state may exist when regions with opposite sign of interaction exists and the net interaction between electrons is close to zero. The plausible relevance of our result to the anomalous metal state is discussed.</description>

      <title>Transmission eigenvalue distribution in disordered media from radiant field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a field-theoretic framework, called radiant field theory, to calculate the distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation in disordered media. At its core is a self-consistent transport equation for a $2\times 2$ matrix radiance, reminiscent of the radiative transfer equation but capable of capturing coherent interference effects. This framework goes beyond the limitations of the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar theory by accounting for both quasiballistic and diffusive regimes. It also handles open geometries inaccessible to standard wave-equation solvers such as infinite slabs. Analytical and numerical solutions are provided for these geometries, highlighting in particular the impact of the waveguide shape and the grazing modes on the transmission eigenvalue distribution in the quasiballistic regime. By removing the macroscopic assumptions of random matrix models, this microscopic theory enables the calculation of transmission statistics in regimes previously out of reach. It also provides a foundation for exploring more complex observables and physical effects relevant to wavefront shaping in realistic disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Radiant Field Theory: A Transport Approach to Shaped Wave Transmission through Disordered Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a field-theoretic framework to characterize the distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation through disordered media. The central outcome is a transport equation for a matrix-valued radiance, analogous to the classical radiative transport equation but capable of capturing coherent effects encoded in the transmission matrix. Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which presumes uniform angular scattering by material slices. As a result, it remains valid beyond the diffusive regime, accurately describing the transmission eigenvalue distribution in the quasiballistic regime as well. Moreover, the framework is more versatile than the DMPK theory, enabling straightforward incorporation of experimental realities such as absorption and incomplete channel control. These factors are frequently encountered in wave experiments on complex media but have lacked an ab initio theoretical treatment until now. We validate our predictions through numerical simulations based on the microscopic wave equation, confirming the accuracy and broad applicability of the theory.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.</description>

      <title>Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>
