      <title>Ultra-sensitive graphene-based electro-optic sensors for optically-multiplexed neural recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale neural recording with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for understanding information processing in brain, yet current neural interfaces fall far short of comprehensively capturing brain activity due to extremely high neuronal density and limited scalability. Although recent advances have miniaturized neural probes and increased channel density, fundamental design constraints still prevent dramatic scaling of simultaneously recorded channels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel electro-optic sensor that directly converts ultra-low-amplitude neural electrical signals into optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratio. By leveraging the ultra-high bandwidth and intrinsic multiplexing capability of light, this approach offers a scalable path toward massively parallel neural recording beyond the limits of traditional electrical interfaces. The sensor integrates an on-chip photonic microresonator with a graphene layer, enabling direct detection of neural signals without genetically encoded optical indicators or tissue modification, making it suitable for human translation. Neural signals are locally transduced into amplified optical modulations and transmitted through on-chip waveguides, enabling interference-free recording without bulky electromagnetic shielding. Arrays of wavelength-selective sensors can be multiplexed on a single bus waveguide using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), greatly improving scalability while maintaining a minimal footprint to reduce tissue damage. We demonstrate detection of evoked neural signals as small as 25 $\mu$V with 3 dB SNR from mouse brain tissue and show multiplexed recording from 10 sensors on a single waveguide. These results establish a proof-of-concept for optically multiplexed neural recording and point toward scalable, high-density neural interfaces for neurological research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>End-to-end differentiable design of geometric waveguide displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric waveguides are a promising architecture for optical see-through augmented reality displays, but their performance is severely bottlenecked by the difficulty of jointly optimizing non-sequential light transport and polarization-dependent multilayer thin-film coatings. Here we present the first end-to-end differentiable optimization framework for geometric waveguide that couples non-sequential Monte Carlo polarization ray tracing with a differentiable transfer-matrix thin-film solver. A differentiable Monte Carlo ray tracer avoids the exponential growth of deterministic ray splitting while enabling gradients backpropagation from eyebox metrics to design parameters. With memory-saving strategies, we optimize more than one thousand layer-thickness parameters and billions of non-sequential ray-surface intersections on a single multi-GPU workstation. Automated layer pruning is achieved by starting from over-parameterized stacks and driving redundant layers to zero thickness under discrete manufacturability constraints, effectively performing topology optimization to discover optimal coating structures. On a representative design, starting from random initialization within thickness bounds, our method increases light efficiency from 4.1\% to 33.5\% and improves eyebox and FoV uniformity by $\sim$17$\times$ and $\sim$11$\times$, respectively. Furthermore, we jointly optimize the waveguide and an image preprocessing network to improve perceived image quality. Our framework not only enables system-level, high-dimensional coating optimization inside the waveguide, but also expands the scope of differentiable optics for next-generation optical design.</description>

      <title>Modifications to Image Phase Alignment Super-sampling Produce up to 4.4 times Increased Image Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Phase Alignment Super-sampling (ImPASS) is a computational method for combining displaced low-resolution images into a single high-resolution image. The general steps include measuring the relative displacements, up-sampling, aligning and combining the images, followed by a blind deconvolution. Previous ImPASS studies have shown that the resulting image resolution can significantly subceed the diffraction limit of the imaging system. Characteristics that potentially limit the processed image resolution include optical parameters, detector noise, image alignment accuracy, or deconvolution parameters. In this report, modifications have been made to the algorithm to improve the image alignment accuracy and deconvolution. Applications of the modified algorithm improved image resolution by a factor up to 1.81. Compared to the original image resolution, the modified ImPASS achieved a resolution improvement factor up to 4.41 while subceeding the diffraction limit by a factor of 2.57. This suggests that limitations imposed by the physical properties of the system have not yet been reached, and further improvement of the algorithm is warranted.</description>

      <title>Processing-Dependent Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer at Au/SiC Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal annealing is a widely used thin-film processing technique for modifying interfacial optical losses and electronic scattering in plasmonic materials. Here, we investigate how thermal annealing of gold thin films deposited on silicon carbide substrates influences interfacial near-field radiative heat transfer across nanoscale vacuum gaps. Using experimentally measured dielectric functions for annealed and unannealed Au films, we evaluate the spectral and total radiative heat flux between Au/SiC interfaces within a fluctuational electrodynamics framework.
  We show that annealing-induced changes in the low-frequency dielectric losses of Au significantly alter evanescent electromagnetic coupling at the interface, leading to enhancements of up to ~40\% in the total near-field radiative heat transfer at separations of tens of nanometers. Mode-resolved analysis reveals that this enhancement originates from strengthened coupling of overdamped plasmonic surface modes, which are highly sensitive to thin-film processing and interfacial microstructure. These results demonstrate that standard thermal annealing provides a practical route for tuning interfacial radiative heat transfer in metallic thin-film systems without modifying material composition or geometry, offering guidance for the design and interpretation of nanoscale thermal and plasmonic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Photonic Temporal Illusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with unusual optical properties are central to advanced control of light. Yet, in nature, such materials may be exceedingly rare and often difficult to obtain. To overcome this limitation, here we introduce the concept of temporal illusion: A temporally dynamic framework in which carefully programmed temporal variations in effective parameters generate responses akin to those of, in principle, any arbitrary time-invariant structure. We theoretically demonstrate that proper modulation of the permittivity of a conventional dielectric in space and time replicates the optical behavior associated with exotic materials. Besides, we reveal that, beyond steady-state effects, temporal illusion also enables control over transient responses, for instance, by effectively lowering the time constant of high-quality-factor resonators, therefore, allowing faster energy accumulation. Moreover, by incorporating detuning between modulation and excitation, we show that the framework unlocks additional functionalities. The temporal illusion paradigm thus broadens the capabilities of space-time varying systems, offering a powerful route to synthesize material responses on demand and paving the way for new theoretical and experimental directions in optics and wave physics.</description>

      <title>Self-heterodyne spectroscopy via a non-uniformly spaced frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency comb spectroscopy has significantly advanced molecular spectroscopy across scientific research and diverse applications. Among its key performance metrics especially for time-resolved studies, sensitivity and measurement speed are paramount. However, a long-standing compromise between these parameters arises from the need for noise reduction. Here, we introduce a comb spectroscopy system that overcomes this limitation using a single frequency comb of non-uniformly spaced modes. The comb is generated using an extremely simple setup, composed of a continuous-wave (CW) fiber laser and a single-sideband phase modulator (SSM). Our approach delivers optical-to-radio-frequency conversion comparable to dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) but through a simplified self-heterodyning architecture. By leveraging the intrinsic mutual coherence of the comb, this design achieves a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient (NEA) of 5.0*10^(-6) Hz^(-1/2)--an order-of-magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art DCS, coupled with long-term stability. The system resolves weak molecular overtone spectra on nanosecond timescales, in a single-shot measurement, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 128. This integration of high sensitivity, resolution, and speed resolves the core trade-off that has long constrained time-resolved spectroscopic analysis.</description>

      <title>Silicon photonic optical-electrical-optical converters based on load-resistor and current-injection operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical-electrical-optical (OEO) converters are key primitives for low-latency, energy-efficient photonic computing because they enable nonlinear activation and optical signal regeneration on chip. We report two monolithically integrated silicon-photonic OEO converters-load-resistor (high-speed variant) and current-injection (high-gain variant) types-fabricated at a silicon photonics foundry. Each device combines a germanium photodetector with a micro-ring modulator (MRM). The converters exhibit reconfigurable nonlinear transfer functions and measurable on-chip RF OEO gain. The RF OEO gain scales linearly with the MRM bias power, with slopes of 0.10 mW^-1 (load-resistor of 10 k{\Omega}) and 1.4 mW^-1 (current-injection), enabling a gain &gt; 1 region at practical bias powers (~10 mW and ~1 mW, respectively). Eye diagrams confirm clear openings up to 4 Gb/s for a high-speed load-resistor variant with a 500-{\Omega} load. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a monolithically integrated, foundry-fabricated silicon-photonic load-resistor type OEO converter exhibiting reconfigurable nonlinear transfer and on-chip RF OEO gain. In the carrier-injection device, the activation slope exceeds unity, yielding 3.9 dB extinction-ratio regeneration. Short-pulse measurements yield 3-dB bandwidths of 1.49 GHz, 160 MHz (load-resistor of 500 {\Omega} and 10 k{\Omega}), and 76 MHz (current-injection), consistent with the RF data. Energy analysis shows an energy-bandwidth trade-off (RC-limited for load-resistor vs. lifetime-limited for injection) and outline routes to sub-pJ/bit operation via reduced capacitance and improved EO efficiency. These results establish silicon-photonic OEO converters as compact, foundry-compatible building blocks for scalable optoelectronic computing and optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high performance microwave spectral filters using optical microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave photonic (MWP) filters are essential components in microwave systems due to their wide bandwidth, low loss, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. A sharp transition band is critical for precise spectral shaping and interference suppression, yet conventional MWP filters face challenges in achieving both sharp transitions and high reconfigurability. Adaptive MWP filters with sharp transition based on a transversal filter structure using an optical microcomb source are demonstrated in this paper. Four different types of single-band MWP filters with roll-off rates up to ~32.6 dB/GHz and a minimum shape factor of ~1.15 are achieved. In addition, simply through designing tap coefficients, band-pass filters with tunable centre frequencies ranging from 5 GHz to 15 GHz and dual-band MWP filters with various filter response are demonstrated without changing any hardware, where sharp transition is also validated. The adaptive filters with sharp transition presented in this paper offer a stable and highly reconfigurable solution for applications requiring stringent spectral selectivity, such as next-generation wireless networks, high-resolution radar imaging, and advanced biomedical photonic sensing.</description>

      <title>Illumination Angular Spectrum Encoding for Controlling the Functionality of Diffractive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive neural networks have recently emerged as a promising framework for all-optical computing. However, these networks are typically trained for a single task, limiting their potential adoption in systems requiring multiple functionalities. Existing approaches to achieving multi-task functionality either modify the mechanical configuration of the network per task or use a different illumination wavelength or polarization state for each task. In this work, we propose a new control mechanism, which is based on the illumination's angular spectrum. Specifically, we shape the illumination using an amplitude mask that selectively controls its angular spectrum. We employ different illumination masks for achieving different network functionalities, so that the mask serves as a unique task encoder. Interestingly, we show that effective control can be achieved over a very narrow angular range, within the paraxial regime. We numerically illustrate the proposed approach by training a single diffractive network to perform multiple image-to-image translation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate translating handwritten digits into typeset digits of different values, and translating handwritten English letters into typeset numbers and typeset Greek letters, where the type of the output is determined by the illumination's angular components. As we show, the proposed framework can work under different coherence conditions, and can be combined with existing control strategies, such as different wavelengths. Our results establish the illumination angular spectrum as a powerful degree of freedom for controlling diffractive networks, enabling a scalable and versatile framework for multi-task all-optical computing.</description>

      <title>Widefield two-photon random illumination microscopy (2P-RIM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological and biomedical samples are routinely examined using focused two-photon (2P) fluorescence microscopy due to its intrinsic axial sectioning and reduced out-of-focus bleaching. However, 2P imaging often requires excitation intensities that can damage samples through ionization and radical formation. Additionally, the lateral resolution of 2P microscopy is lower compared to linear one-photon (1P) fluorescence microscopy. Widefield 2P microscopy, using cameras, holds promise for reducing photo-toxicity while maintaining high image acquisition rates. Widefield imaging trades the high power and short integration times of sequential single point scanning for the low power and extended integration times of parallel detection across millions of pixels. However, generating effective axial sectioning over arbitrarily large fields of view (FOVs) has remained a challenge. In this work, we introduce 2P Random Illumination Microscopy (2P-RIM), an easy-to-implement 2P widefield technique, that achieves low photo-damage, fast imaging, micrometric axial sectioning, and enhanced lateral resolution for arbitrarily large FOVs. By using widefield speckled illuminations in conjunction with an image standard deviation matching algorithm, 2P-RIM demonstrated multicolor imaging over FOVs greater than 200 um, lateral resolution 220 nm, axial sectioning 2 um, and peak excitation powers about 10 times lower than those used in focused laser scanning microscopy.</description>

      <title>Long-lived state of a helium-like magnesium donor in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation of ortho states of a helium-like Mg donor in silicon is investigated by measuring the modulation of background radiation transmission through impurity centers under pulsed photoexcitation. Long-lived states of the spin-triplet 1s(3T2) group with a lifetime of about 20 ms are observed. The temperature dependence indicates that the relaxation is governed by the Orbach mechanism with an activation energy ~13 meV, which is close to the exchange splitting energy of the excited 1s states of the Mg donor.</description>

      <title>Tunable Quantum Interference in Free Space with a Liquid-Crystal Metagrating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured optical materials provide a promising platform for photonic quantum information processing in free space. Beam splitters, a fundamental building block of photonic circuits, have recently been demonstrated in free space using geometric-phase optical elements. These devices coherently mix circularly-polarized transverse modes of freely-propagating optical fields, including modes carrying orbital angular momentum. In this work, we investigate liquid-crystal metagratings as electrically tunable beam splitters for transverse-momentum optical modes. By exploiting the voltage-controlled birefringence of liquid-crystal metasurfaces, we experimentally tune the splitting ratio of the device and thereby control the degree of two-photon interference between indistinguishable photons. At the output, photons are spatially resolved on different regions of a time-resolved single-photon-sensitive detector, enabling the reconstruction of coincidence maps in the Fourier plane. This approach is readily scalable and enables highly parallel coincidence measurements across a large number of optical modes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear virtual lens for programmable and multispectral infrared upconversion imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional infrared (IR) imaging techniques depend on IR cameras based on narrow-bandgap semiconductors, which offer limited spectral bandwidth, coupled with a separate lens. Recently, advances in nonlinear flat optics have opened a novel pathway for converting IR signals into the visible through nonlinear generations, enabling the direct visualisation of IR images using standard visible cameras. However, the narrow spectral bandwidth and the requirement for an additional lens remain the key challenges. Here, we address both issues via a novel adaptive and multifunctional IR-to-visible imaging platform offering tunable bandwidth and focusing simultaneously. We utilise sum-frequency generation (SFG) to convert IR light into the visible, by introducing a pump beam modulated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) to construct a virtual metalens enabling precisely controlled focusing of the generated nonlinear optical field. As a result, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally an optical focusing mechanism with a tunable focal length, achieved by varying the pump and signal wavelengths and modulating the phase distribution. Furthermore, since the focal length depends on the input signal wavelength, the imaging plane position varies accordingly, indicating a promising potential for the multispectral IR imaging applications. Our upconversion platform delivers SLM-controlled, programmable multispectral focusing for next-generation IR imaging, opening new avenues in the fields of computational and multispectral imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Modulating near-field radiative energy and momentum transfer via rotating Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study near-field radiative transfer of energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum between a nanoparticle and a plate consisting of magnetic Weyl semimetals, and demonstrate that these can be efficiently tuned by a relative angle between the Weyl node separations. This tunability originates from the coupling between the particle-induced rotational Poynting vector and the nonreciprocal surface plasmon polaritons supported by the plate. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive regime in which both energy and angular momentum transfer are maximized when the Weyl node separations are antiparallel rather than parallel. This arises from optimal mode matching between the rotation direction of the particle's circular heat flux and the propagation direction of the surface plasmon polaritons in the antiparallel configuration.</description>

      <title>How Dark is Dark? A Reflectance and Scattering Analysis of Black Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black materials play a critical role in applications such as image registration, camera calibration, stray light suppression, and visual design. Although many such materials appear similarly dark under diffuse illumination, their reflectance behavior can differ substantially as a function of viewing and lighting geometry. Ultra-black materials achieve exceptional light attenuation but are often constrained by cost and mechanical fragility, motivating the evaluation of more robust and accessible alternatives. In this study, we employ a gonimetric measurement system to capture the isotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution function of a range of black materials, including the ultra-black reference Vantablack, commercially available alternatives such as Musou Black and black velvet, and standard matte black coatings. We analyze their reflectance characteristics in terms of diffuse and specular scattering, as well as total integrated scatter, to quantify angular-dependent reflection. In addition, we compare their perceptual appearance using physically based rendering driven by the measured BRDFs and a psychophysical evaluation of perceived darkness. Together, these analyses provide a comprehensive assessment of black materials that links reflectance properties to visual appearance and perceptual performance, enabling informed material selection for optical applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Entropy and Generalized Thermodynamics of Solitonic Event Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Increasing the secret key rates and point-to-multipoint extension for experimental coherent-one-way quantum key distribution protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, a secret key is created between two distant users (transmitter and receiver) at a particular key rate. Quantum technology can facilitate secure communication for cryptographic applications, combining QKD with one-time-pad (OTP) encryption. In order to ensure the continuous operation of QKD in real-world networks, efforts have been concentrated on optimizing the use of components and effective QKD protocols to improve secret key rates and increase the transmission between multiple users. Generally, in experimental implementations, the secret key rates are limited by single-photon detectors, which are used at the receivers of QKD and create a bottleneck due to their limited detection rates (detectors with low detection efficiency and high detector dead-time). We experimentally show that secret key rates can be increased by combining the time-bin information of two such detectors on the data line of the receiver for the coherent-one-way (COW) QKD protocol with a minimal increase in quantum bit error rate (QBER, the proportion of erroneous bits). Further, we implement a point-to-multipoint COW QKD protocol, introducing an additional receiver module. The three users (one transmitter and two receivers) share the secret key in post-processing, relying on OTP encryption. Typically, the dual-receiver extension can improve the combined secret key rates of the system; however, one has to optimise the experimental parameters to achieve this within security margins. These methods are general and can be applied to any implementation of the COW protocol.</description>

      <title>A scalable gallium-phosphide-on-diamond spin-photon interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient interfacing of quantum emitters and photons is fundamental to quantum networking. Quantum defects embedded in integrated nanophotonic circuits are promising for such applications due to the deterministic light-matter interactions of high-cooperativity ($C&gt;1$) cavity quantum electrodynamics and potential for scalable integration with active photonic processing. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip. Here we realize the first high-cooperativity coupling of quantum defects to hybrid-integrated nanophotonics in a scalable, planar platform. We integrate more than 600 gallium phosphide (GaP) nanophotonic cavities on a diamond substrate with near-surface SiV centers. We examine a particular device with two strongly coupled SiV centers in detail, confirming above-unity cooperativity via multiple independent measurements. Application of an external magnetic field via a permanent magnet enables optical resolution of the SiV spin transitions from which we determine a spin-relaxation time $T_1&gt;0.4$ ms at 4 K. We utilize the high cooperativity coupling to observe spin-dependent transmission switching and the quantum jumps of the SiV spin via single-shot readout. These results, coupled with GaP's strong nonlinear properties, establish GaP-on-diamond as a scalable planar platform for quantum network applications.</description>

      <title>Topological sensing of superfluid rotation using non-Hermitian optical dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a non-Hermitian optical dimer whose parameters are renormalized by dispersive and dissipative backaction from the coupling of the passive cavity with a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\pm \ell \hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings. Importantly, the sensing proposals are intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the coherence of the atomic superfluid.</description>

      <title>Scalable Generation of Macroscopic Fock States Exceeding 10,000 Photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalable preparation of bosonic quantum states with macroscopic excitations poses a fundamental challenge in quantum technologies, limited by control complexity and photon-loss rates that severely constrain prior theoretical and experimental efforts to merely dozens of excitations per mode. Here, based on the duality of the quantum state evolution in Fock state space and the optical wave-function propagation in a waveguide array, we introduce a Kerr-engineered multi-lens protocol in a single bosonic mode to deterministically generate Fock states exceeding $10,000$ photons. By optimizing phase and displacement operations across lens groups, our approach compensates for non-paraxial aberrations, achieving fidelities above $73\%$ in numerical simulations for photon numbers up to $N=100,000$. Counterintuitively, the protocol's execution time scales as $N^{-1/2}$ with the target photon number $N$, exhibiting robustness against the photon loss. Our framework enables exploration of quantum-to-classical transitions of giant Fock states, paving the way for advanced quantum metrology with significant quantum gains, and error-corrected quantum information processing in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>The multi-modes Bessel-Gaussian OAM hologram encoding based on convolutional neural networks</title>

Abstract: Multi-mode vortex light is a superposition of different orbital angular momentum (OAM) lights. However, as the number of OAM modes increases, the sampling constant changes. Using the traditional sparsely sampling will lead to severe loss of detail, reduced image resolution. To achieve high capacity and resolution of the OAM hologram, this paper prepares a multi-mode Bessel-Gaussian (MBG) selected hologram by stacking different mode combinations of BG phases on a MBG saved hologram in stages. Using a MBG beam with opposite combination parameters to illuminate the MBG OAM hologram, the target image can be reconstructed after the Fourier transform, and the sampling constant is flexible and controllable. The holograms encode MBG mode combination parameters. The additional degree of freedom provided by combining with MBG OAM beam offers more multiplexing channels and a higher security hologram. To further improve the quality of holograms, we first save the holograms and the corresponding MBG mode combination parameters when the quality of the obtained hologram is high based on Actor-Critic neural networks. Secondly, we gradually adjust the MBG mode combination parameters. Finally, we confirm the reasonable range of the MBG mode combination parameters.</description>

      <title>Optical vortex generation by magnons with spin-orbit-coupled light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light possesses both spin and orbital angular momentum. In spatially asymmetric optical fields, these properties undergo spontaneous coupling, referred to as optical spin-orbit coupling. The study of the coupling has recently become central in modern optics due to its substantial applications in communications, sensing, and quantum control. A key challenge is to clarify the relationship between the origins of spatially asymmetric optical fields and the resulting spin-orbit coupling. Current research focuses on materials and configurations exhibiting spatial asymmetry, such as focusing lenses, interfaces, inhomogeneous media, and metasurfaces. However, Maxwell's equations indicate that matter can introduce both spatial and temporal asymmetry into optical fields. For instance, magnetic ordering breaks the time-reversal symmetry of interacting optical fields via the magneto-optical effect, introducing nonreciprocity in the resulting optical phenomena. Despite the importance, optical phenomena involving both spatially and temporally asymmetric optical fields remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that breaking time and spatial symmetries through magnons and light focusing, respectively, transforms an input Gaussian beam into a specific optical vortex beam in a nonreciprocal manner. This phenomenon is quantitatively explained by integrating the physics of magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering with optical spin-orbit coupling. The observed conservation of total angular momentum, encompassing both magnons and photons, further indicates that magnons can control both spin and orbital angular momentum of light. Finally, we outline future research directions enabled by asymmetric optical fields in both space and time.</description>

      <title>Topological Quenching of Noise in a Free-Running Moebius Microcomb</title>

Abstract: Microcombs require ultralow-noise repetition rates to enable next-generation applications in metrology, high-speed communications, microwave photonics, and sensing, where spectral purity is a central performance metric. Best-performing sources operate actively locked at "quiet points" in parameter space, fixed by device and material properties. Creating broad, low-noise operating regions with relaxed constraints-especially in simplified free-running architectures that avoid electronics-heavy control-remains an open challenge. Here, we demonstrate a symmetry-protected topological M\"obius soliton molecule that enables intrinsically low phase noise in a fully free-running microcomb, operating without any external referencing or control. Using a microresonator-filtered laser, we implement a M\"obius geometry via interleaved microcavity modes. Upon the formation of a topological M\"obius soliton molecule, the free-running laser exhibits over 15 dB of phase-noise suppression across 10 Hz-10 kHz at a 100 GHz repetition rate, yielding -63 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1 kHz and an Allan deviation of 4x10^-10 at 10 s average time-without any external control. We show that the M\"obius structure brings dynamic robustness to the comb, and we demonstrate a symmetry-protected topological regime that enables long-term drift-invariant operation. Our results establish a route to intrinsically noise-quenched microcombs operating in a fully free-running configuration, governed by internal physical principles and suitable for field-deployable, low-noise photonic systems.</description>

Abstract: A fully stabilized frequency comb is essential for precision metrology and coherent optical synthesis. However, fully-stabilized frequency combs generally require separate stages for supercontinuum generation (SCG) and self-referencing, largely limiting their compactness. Here, enabled by the low-threshold multi-octave supercontinuum generation and concurrent third-harmonic generation in low-loss silicon nitride waveguides, we present a novel approach to a self-referenced frequency comb source at 1 GHz repetition rate spanning from the full visible (VIS) to the mid-infrared (MIR). Our coherent comb is seeded by an all-polarization-maintaining ultrafast fiber laser at 1556 nm, with a pulse duration of 73 fs at 1 GHz repetition rate. With an injected energy of merely 110 pJ, the pulses propagate through dispersion-engineered Si3N4 waveguides, generating supercontinuum spanning over three octaves from 350-3280 nm i.e. 0.76 PHz of coherent bandwidth. Moreover, the on-chip third harmonic generation provides a carrier envelope offset beat note via f-3f with a signal-to-noise ratio of 43 dB. Fueled by the evolving photonic integration providing possibilities of on-chip filtering and photo-detectors, this approach for single-chip self-referencing of high-repetition-rate frequency combs paves the way for ultrabroadband comb sources with unprecedented compactness and field-readiness.</description>

Abstract: While photonic lanterns efficiently and uniquely map a set of input modes to single-mode outputs (or vice versa), the optical mode transfer matrix of any particular fabricated device cannot be constrained at the design stage due to manufacturing imperfections. Accurate knowledge of the mapping enables complex sensing or beam control applications that leverage multimode conversion. In this work, we present a characterisation system to directly measure the electric field from a photonic lantern using digital off-axis holography, following its evolution over a 73 nm range near 1550 nm and in two orthogonal, linear polarisations. We provide the first multi-wavelength, polarisation decomposed characterisation of the principal modes of a photonic lantern. Performance of our testbed is validated on a single-mode fibre then harnessed to characterise a 19-port, multicore fibre fed photonic lantern. We uncover the typical wavelength scale at which the modal mapping evolves and measure the relative dispersion in the device, finding significant differences with idealised simulations. In addition to detailing the system, we also share the empirical mode transfer matrices, enabling future work in astrophotonic design, computational imaging, device fabrication feedback loops and beam shaping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical routers are fundamental to photonic systems, but their performance is often limited by unwanted reflections and constrained functionalities. Existing design strategies generally lack complete control over reflectionless pathways and typically require computationally intensive iterative optimization. A general analytical framework for the inverse design of arbitrary reflectionless routing has remained unavailable. Here, we present an analytical inverse-design approach based on non-Hermitian zero-index networks, which enables arbitrary reflectionless routing for nearly any desired scattering response. By establishing a direct algebraic mapping between target scattering responses and the network's physical parameters, we transform the design process from iterative optimization into deterministic calculation. This approach enables the precise engineering of arbitrary reflectionless optical routing. We demonstrate its broad utility by designing devices from unicast and multicast routers with full amplitude and phase control to coherent beam combiners and spatial mode demultiplexers in four-port and six-port networks. Our work provides a systematic and analytical route to designing advanced light-control devices.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Three Dimensional Traction Force Microscopy Framework for Uncovering the Mechanics of Bio-Adhesion</title>

Abstract: This study presents a novel, versatile traction force microscopy framework for quantifying three-dimensional (3D) interfacial forces during bio-adhesion by integrating in situ stereo digital image correlation with finite element (FE) simulation. The method enables accurate measurement of microscale displacements and force distributions at the interfaces in both dry and wet environments, addressing limitations of conventional microscopy techniques related to limited measurement scales, restricted fields of view, and surface disturbance from contact or fluorescence. An analytical model was developed to guide the design of a deformable substrate, supporting selection of substrate material and thickness of the substrate. System accuracy was examined through steel ball compression experiments, which were validated against FE simulations. The framework was applied to marine mussel plaque adhesion under 15 directional tension to characterize interfacial traction force distributions. Sensitivity analyses examined the effects of Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus, and constitutive models on the results. This approach offers a versatile platform for investigating interfacial mechanics in adhesives, with broad relevance to bioengineering applications.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up Analysis of Ro-Vibrational Helical Dichroism</title>

Abstract: Helical dichroism (HD) is a proposed method for the resolution of molecular chirality, employing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. Going beyond the conventional assumptions about HD, this work proposes a rigid theoretical framework for the analysis of the HD, based on molecular symmetries and rotational eigenstates. We derive the rotational selection rules, which clearly establish that HD only emerges from the spin-orbit coupling of light, even for beams without far-field OAM. Our findings refine the conditions for observing HD, shedding light on the outcome of prior experiments and guiding future designs for chiral sensing using structured light.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-world Lens Active Alignment with Unlabeled Data via Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.</description>
