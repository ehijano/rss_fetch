      <title>Approximation of skew Brownian motion by snapping-out Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on the theorem saying that as permeability coefficients of snapping-out Brownian motions tend to infinity in such a way that their ratio remains constant, these processes converge to a skew Brownian motion. In particular, convergence of the related semigroups, cosine families and projections is discussed.</description>

      <title>Higher order integration by parts formulae for Wiener measures on a path space between two curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have formulated higher-order integration by parts formulae on the path space restricted between two curves, with respect to pinned/ordinary Wiener measures. The higher-order integration by parts formulae introduce nontrivial boundary terms, unlike the first-order one. Furthermore, in the process of proving these formulae, it becomes necessary to employ the construction methods of Brownian excursion and Brownian house-moving through random walk approximations. To express the integration by parts formula concisely, we introduced a notation called Symmetrization. This notation enables the rewriting of the intricate expressions of boundary terms associated with higher-order integration by parts into more concise forms. Additionally, we provided a probabilistic explanation for the boundary terms by introducing symbols based on the concept of infinitesimal probability. These efforts are aimed at fostering an intuitive understanding of the integration by parts formulae.</description>

      <title>Stable quadrangulations and stable spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider scaling limits of random quadrangulations obtained by applying the Cori-Vauquelin-Schaeffer bijection to Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees with stably-decaying offspring tails with an exponent $\alpha$ in (1, 2). We show that these quadrangulations admit subsequential scaling limits wich all have Hausdorff dimension $\frac{2\alpha}{\alpha-1}$ almost surely. We conjecture that the limits are unique and spherical, and we introduce a candidate for the limit that we call the $\alpha$-stable sphere. In addition, we conduct a detailed study of volume fluctuations around typical points in the limiting maps, and show that the fluctuations share similar characteristics with those of stable trees.</description>

      <title>Weak coupling limit of a Brownian particle in the curl of the 2D GFF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the weak coupling limit of the following equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$: $$dX_t^\varepsilon=\frac{\hat{\lambda}}{\sqrt{\log\frac1\varepsilon}}\omega^\varepsilon(X_t^\varepsilon)dt+\nu dB_t,\quad X_0^\varepsilon=0. $$ Here $\omega^\varepsilon=\nabla^{\perp}\rho_\varepsilon*\xi$ with $\xi$ representing the $2d$ Gaussian Free Field (GFF) and $\rho_\varepsilon$ denoting an appropriate identity. $B_t$ denotes a two-dimensional standard Brownian motion, and $\hat{\lambda},\nu&gt;0$ are two given constants. We use the approach from \cite{Cannizzaro.2023} to show that the second moment of $X_t^\varepsilon$ under the annealed law converges to $(c(\nu)^2+2\nu^2)t$ with a precisely determined constant $c(\nu)&gt;0$, which implies a non-trivial limit of the drift terms as $\varepsilon$ vanishes. We also prove that in this weak coupling regime, the sequence of solutions converges in distribution to $\left(\sqrt{\frac{c(\nu)^2}{2}+\nu^2}\right)\widetilde{B}_t$ as $\varepsilon$ vanishes, where $\widetilde{B}_t$ is a two-dimensional standard Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>First order of the renewal covering of the natural numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of covering process that covers the set of natural numbers using renewal processes as objects. Inspired by the behavior of prime numbers, the model in each step finds the smallest vacant point, $k$, and place, starting in $k$, a renewal process with a step distribution given by a geometric random variable with parameter $\frac{1}{k}$. The model depends on its entire past, and small perturbations in its initial value can lead to very different outcomes. Here, we expose a technique that finds the first-order limit behavior for the number of objects placed until $n$, which exhibits intriguing similarities to prime number distributions, having a concentration around $n\log{n}$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness Problem for the Backward Differential Equation of a Continuous-State Branching Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distributional properties of a multi-dimensional continuous-state branching process are determined by its cumulant semigroup, which is defined by the backward differential equation. We provide a proof of the assertion of Rhyzhov and Skorokhod (Theory Probab. Appl., 1970) on the uniqueness of the solutions to the equation, which is based on a characterization of the process as the pathwise unique solution to a system of stochastic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper,we develop a local-to-global and measure-theoretical approach to understand datasets. The idea is to take network models with restricted domains as local charts of datasets. We develop the mathematical foundations for these structures, and show in experiments how it can be used to find fuzzy domains and to improve accuracy in data classification problems.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic estimates for accelerated high order Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new algorithms, namely aHOLA and aHOLLA, to sample from high-dimensional target distributions with possibly super-linearly growing potentials. We establish non-asymptotic convergence bounds for aHOLA in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distances with rates of convergence equal to $1+q/2$ and $1/2+q/4$, respectively, under a local H\"{o}lder condition with exponent $q\in(0,1]$ and a convexity at infinity condition on the potential of the target distribution. Similar results are obtained for aHOLLA under certain global continuity conditions and a dissipativity condition. Crucially, we achieve state-of-the-art rates of convergence of the proposed algorithms in the non-convex setting which are higher than those of the existing algorithms. Numerical experiments are conducted to sample from several distributions and the results support our main findings.</description>

      <title>The largest subgraph without a forbidden induced subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the systematic study of the following Tur\'an-type question. Suppose $\Gamma$ is a graph with $n$ vertices such that the edge density between any pair of subsets of vertices of size at least $t$ is at most $1 - c$, for some $t$ and $c &gt; 0$. What is the largest number of edges in a subgraph $G \subseteq \Gamma$ which does not contain a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph or, more generally, which belongs to a hereditary property $\mathcal{P}$? This provides a common generalization of two recently studied cases, namely $\Gamma$ being a (pseudo-)random graph and a graph without a large complete bipartite subgraph. We focus on the interesting case where $H$ is a bipartite graph.
  We determine the answer up to a constant factor with respect to $n$ and $t$, for certain bipartite $H$ and for $\Gamma$ either a dense random graph or a Paley graph with a square number of vertices. In particular, our bounds match if $H$ is a tree, or if one part of $H$ has $d$ vertices complete to the other part, all other vertices in that part have degree at most $d$, and the other part has sufficiently many vertices. As applications of the latter result, we answer a question of Alon, Krivelevich, and Samotij on the largest subgraph with a hereditary property which misses a bipartite graph, and determine up to a constant factor the largest number of edges in a string subgraph of $\Gamma$. The proofs are based on a variant of the dependent random choice and a novel approach for finding induced copies by inductively defining probability distributions supported on induced copies of smaller subgraphs.</description>

      <title>The moment problem for random objects in a category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moment problem in probability theory asks for criteria for when there exists a unique measure with a given tuple of moments. We study a variant of this problem for random objects in a category, where a moment is given by the average number of epimorphisms to a fixed object. When the moments do not grow too fast, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a distribution with those moments, show that a unique such measure exists, give formulas for the measure in terms of the moments, and prove that measures with those limiting moments approach that particular measure. Our result applies to categories satisfying some finiteness conditions and a condition that gives an analog of the second isomorphism theorem, including the categories of finite groups, finite modules, finite rings, as well as many variations of these categories. This work is motivated by the non-abelian Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet program in number theory, which aims to calculate the distribution of random profinite groups arising as Galois groups of maximal unramified extensions of random number fields.</description>

      <title>Exponential Euler method for stiff stochastic differential equations with additive fractional Brownian noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a system of stochastic differential equations with a stiff linear term and additive noise driven by fractional Brownian motions (fBms) with Hurst parameter H&gt;1/2, which arise e. g., from spatial approximations of stochastic partial differential equations. For their numerical approximation, we present an exponential Euler scheme and show that it converges in the strong sense with an exact rate close to the Hurst parameter H. Further, based on (E. Buckwar, M.G. Riedler, and P.E. Kloeden 2011), we conclude the existence of a unique stationary solution of the exponential Euler scheme that is pathwise asymptotically stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glauber dynamics of the Ising model on a random regular graph is known to mix fast below the tree uniqueness threshold and exponentially slowly above it. We show that Kawasaki dynamics of the canonical ferromagnetic Ising model on a random $d$-regular graph mixes fast beyond the tree uniqueness threshold when $d$ is large enough (and conjecture that it mixes fast up to the tree reconstruction threshold for all $d\geq 3$). This result follows from a more general spectral condition for (modified) log-Sobolev inequalities for conservative dynamics of Ising models. The proof of this condition in fact extends to perturbations of distributions with log-concave generating polynomial.</description>

Abstract: A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces.

      <description>arXiv:2212.09706v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multiple testing literature has primarily dealt with three types of dependence assumptions between p-values: independence, positive regression dependence, and arbitrary dependence. In this paper, we provide what we believe are the first theoretical results under various notions of negative dependence (negative Gaussian dependence, negative regression dependence, negative association, negative orthant dependence and weak negative dependence). These include the Simes global null test and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which are known experimentally to be anti-conservative under negative dependence. The anti-conservativeness of these procedures is bounded by factors smaller than that under arbitrary dependence (in particular, by factors independent of the number of hypotheses). We also provide new results about negatively dependent e-values, and provide several examples as to when negative dependence may arise. Our proofs are elementary and short, thus amenable to extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new concept of codivergence, which quantifies the similarity between two probability measures $P_1, P_2$ relative to a reference probability measure $P_0$. In the neighborhood of the reference measure $P_0$, a codivergence behaves like an inner product between the measures $P_1 - P_0$ and $P_2 - P_0$. Codivergences of covariance-type and correlation-type are introduced and studied with a focus on two specific correlation-type codivergences, the $\chi^2$-codivergence and the Hellinger codivergence. We derive explicit expressions for several common parametric families of probability distributions. For a codivergence, we introduce moreover the divergence matrix as an analogue of the Gram matrix. It is shown that the $\chi^2$-divergence matrix satisfies a data-processing inequality.</description>

      <title>Derivative based global sensitivity analysis and its entropic link</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variance-based Sobol' sensitivity is one of the most well known measures in global sensitivity analysis (GSA). However, uncertainties with certain distributions, such as highly skewed distributions or those with a heavy tail, cannot be adequately characterised using the second central moment only. Entropy-based GSA can consider the entire probability density function, but its application has been limited because it is difficult to estimate. Here we present a novel derivative-based upper bound for conditional entropies, to efficiently rank uncertain variables and to work as a proxy for entropy-based total effect indices. To overcome the non-desirable issue of negativity for differential entropies as sensitivity indices, we discuss an exponentiation of the total effect entropy and its proxy. We found that the proposed new entropy proxy is equivalent to the proxy for variance-based GSA for linear functions with Gaussian inputs, but outperforms the latter for a river flood physics model with 8 inputs of different distributions. We expect the new entropy proxy to increase the variable screening power of derivative-based GSA and to complement Sobol'-index proxy for a more diverse type of distributions.</description>

      <title>From Trees to Polynomials and Back Again: New Capacity Bounds with Applications to TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give simply exponential lower bounds on the probabilities of a given strongly Rayleigh distribution, depending only on its expectation. This resolves a weak version of a problem left open by Karlin-Klein-Oveis Gharan in their recent breakthrough work on metric TSP, and this resolution leads to a minor improvement of their approximation factor for metric TSP. Our results also allow for a more streamlined analysis of the algorithm.
  To achieve these new bounds, we build upon the work of Gurvits-Leake on the use of the productization technique for bounding the capacity of a real stable polynomial. This technique allows one to reduce certain inequalities for real stable polynomials to products of affine linear forms, which have an underlying matrix structure. In this paper, we push this technique further by characterizing the worst-case polynomials via bipartitioned forests. This rigid combinatorial structure yields a clean induction argument, which implies our stronger bounds.
  In general, we believe the results of this paper will lead to further improvement and simplification of the analysis of various combinatorial and probabilistic bounds and algorithms.</description>

Given a continuous plurisubharmonic function $u$ on $\Omega$, we construct a sequence of Gaussian analytic functions $f_n$ on $\Omega$ associated with $u$ such that $\frac{1}{n}\log|f_n|$ converges to $u$ in $L^1_{loc}(\Omega)$ almost surely, as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Gaussian analytic function $f_n$ is constructed by its covariance, or equivalently by its reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which is given by weighed Bergman space with weight $e^{-2nu}$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We show the normalized zeros of $f_n$ converge to $dd^c u$ in the sense of currents.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the fractional Hardy-H\'enon equation with fractional Brownian noise $$ \partial_t u(t)+(-\Delta)^{\theta/2} u(t)=|x|^{-\gamma} |u(t)|^{p-1}u(t)+\mu \partial_t B^H(t), $$ where $\theta&gt;0$, $p&gt;1$, $\gamma\geq 0$, $\mu \in\mathbb{R}$, and the random forcing $B^H$ is the fractional Brownian motion defined on some complete probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ with Hurst parameter $H\in (0,1)$. We obtain the local existence and uniqueness of mild solutions under tailored conditions on the parameters of the equation.</description>
