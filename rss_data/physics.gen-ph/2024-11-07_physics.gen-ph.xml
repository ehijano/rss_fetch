Abstract: This study proposed an extension of the classical kinetic theory of gases (CKTG) that incorporates the effect of an external gravitational field on the motions of molecular particles. First, we rederived the CKTG in terms of the kinetics of constituent particles to account for the effect of accelerating particles by an external gravitational field. Consequently, we obtained an extended expression for the virial pressure in molecular dynamics under an external potential field. As predicted by our theoretical model, a pressure difference in the gravitational direction was observed in our particle collision simulations. Further analysis proved that if the external potential energy of each particle is sufficiently small (but not negligible compared to its kinetic energy), a pressure difference emerges between the walls while maintaining the properties of equilibrium statistical mechanics, following the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution. Notably, our model was formulated based on only basic knowledge of physics. In summary, this study obtained fundamental insights into the kinetic theory of gases under gravitational fields that will be useful for both education and practical applications.</description>
