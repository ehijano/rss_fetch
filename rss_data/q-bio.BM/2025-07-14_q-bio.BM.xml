      <title>Unraveling the Potential of Diffusion Models in Small Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI presents chemists with novel ideas for drug design and facilitates the exploration of vast chemical spaces. Diffusion models (DMs), an emerging tool, have recently attracted great attention in drug R\&amp;D. This paper comprehensively reviews the latest advancements and applications of DMs in molecular generation. It begins by introducing the theoretical principles of DMs. Subsequently, it categorizes various DM-based molecular generation methods according to their mathematical and chemical applications. The review further examines the performance of these models on benchmark datasets, with a particular focus on comparing the generation performance of existing 3D methods. Finally, it concludes by emphasizing current challenges and suggesting future research directions to fully exploit the potential of DMs in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>AmpLyze: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting the Hemolytic Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red-blood-cell lysis (HC50) is the principal safety barrier for antimicrobial-peptide (AMP) therapeutics, yet existing models only say "toxic" or "non-toxic." AmpLyze closes this gap by predicting the actual HC50 value from sequence alone and explaining the residues that drive toxicity. The model couples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in dual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained with log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model reaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors and the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential, and cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement. Expected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest safer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative, sequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design and offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening.</description>

      <title>Unavailability of experimental 3D structural data on protein folding dynamics and necessity for a new generation of structure prediction methods in this context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Protein folding is a dynamic process during which a protein's amino acid sequence undergoes a series of 3-dimensional (3D) conformational changes en route to reaching a native 3D structure; the resulting 3D structural conformations are called folding intermediates. While data on native 3D structures are abundant, data on 3D structures of non-native intermediates remain sparse, due to limitations of current technologies for experimental determination of 3D structures. Yet, analyzing folding intermediates is crucial for understanding folding dynamics and misfolding-related diseases. Hence, we search the literature for available (experimentally and computationally obtained) 3D structural data on folding intermediates, organizing the data in a centralized resource. Additionally, we assess whether existing methods, designed for predicting native structures, can also be utilized to predict structures of non-native intermediates.
  Results: Our literature search reveals six studies that provide 3D structural data on folding intermediates (two for post-translational and four for co-translational folding), each focused on a single protein, with 2-4 intermediates. Our assessment shows that an established method for predicting native structures, AlphaFold2, does not perform well for non-native intermediates in the context of co-translational folding; a recent study on post-translational folding concluded the same for even more existing methods. Yet, we identify in the literature recent pioneering methods designed explicitly to predict 3D structures of folding intermediates by incorporating intrinsic biophysical characteristics of folding dynamics, which show promise. This study assesses the current landscape and future directions of the field of 3D structural analysis of protein folding dynamics.</description>

      <title>RNA Dynamics and Interactions Revealed through Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA function is deeply intertwined with its conformational dynamics. In this review, we survey recent advances in the use of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to characterize RNA dynamics in diverse contexts, including isolated molecules and complexes with ions, small molecules, or proteins. We highlight how enhanced sampling techniques and integrative approaches can improve both the precision and accuracy of the resulting structural ensembles. Finally, we examine the emerging role of artificial intelligence in accelerating progress in RNA modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Toward the Explainability of Protein Language Models for Sequence Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in a variety of protein-science tasks that range from structure prediction to the design of functional enzymes. However, these models operate as black boxes, and their underlying working principles remain unclear. Here, we survey emerging applications of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to protein language models (pLMs) and describe their potential in protein research. We break down the workflow of a generative decoder-only Transformer into four information contexts: (i) training sequences, (ii) input prompt, (iii) model architecture, and (iv) output sequence. For each, we describe existing methods and applications of XAI. Additionally, from published studies we distil five (potential) roles that XAI can play in protein design: Evaluator, Multitasker, Engineer, Coach, and Teacher, with the Evaluator role being the only one widely adopted so far. These roles aim to help both protein science practitioners and model developers understand the possibilities and limitations of implementing XAI for the design of sequences. Finally, we highlight the critical areas of application for the future, including risks related to security, trustworthiness, and bias, and we call for community benchmarks, open-source tooling, and domain-specific visualizations to advance explainable protein design. Overall, our analysis aims to move the discussion toward the use of XAI in protein design.</description>

      <title>Pocket2Mol: Efficient Molecular Sampling Based on 3D Protein Pockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have achieved tremendous success in designing novel drug molecules in recent years. A new thread of works have shown the great potential in advancing the specificity and success rate of in silico drug design by considering the structure of protein pockets. This setting posts fundamental computational challenges in sampling new chemical compounds that could satisfy multiple geometrical constraints imposed by pockets. Previous sampling algorithms either sample in the graph space or only consider the 3D coordinates of atoms while ignoring other detailed chemical structures such as bond types and functional groups. To address the challenge, we develop Pocket2Mol, an E(3)-equivariant generative network composed of two modules: 1) a new graph neural network capturing both spatial and bonding relationships between atoms of the binding pockets and 2) a new efficient algorithm which samples new drug candidates conditioned on the pocket representations from a tractable distribution without relying on MCMC. Experimental results demonstrate that molecules sampled from Pocket2Mol achieve significantly better binding affinity and other drug properties such as druglikeness and synthetic accessibility.</description>
