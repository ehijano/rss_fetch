      <title>Optimizing and benchmarking the computation of the permanent of general matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the permanent of a matrix is a fundamental computation that emerges in many domains, including traditional fields like computational complexity theory, graph theory, many-body quantum theory and emerging disciplines like machine learning and quantum computing. While conceptually simple, evaluating the permanent is extremely challenging: no polynomial-time algorithm is available (unless $\textsc{P} = \textsc{NP}$). To the best of our knowledge there is no publicly available software that automatically uses the most efficient algorithm for computing the permanent. In this work we designed, developed, and investigated the performance of our software package which evaluates the permanent of an arbitrary rectangular matrix, supporting three algorithms generally regarded as the fastest while giving the exact solution (the straightforward combinatoric algorithm, the Ryser algorithm, and the Glynn algorithm) and, optionally, automatically switching to the optimal algorithm based on the type and dimensionality of the input matrix. To do this, we developed an extension of the Glynn algorithm to rectangular matrices. Our free and open-source software package is distributed via Github, at https://github.com/theochem/matrix-permanent.</description>

      <title>The Syntax and Semantics of einsum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2011, einsum was introduced to NumPy as a practical and convenient notation for tensor expressions in machine learning, quantum circuit simulation, and other fields. It has since been implemented in additional Python frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, as well as in other programming languages such as Julia. Despite its practical success, the einsum notation still lacks a solid theoretical basis, and is not unified across the different frameworks, limiting opportunities for formal reasoning and systematic optimization. In this work, we discuss the terminology of tensor expressions and provide a formal definition of the einsum language. Based on this definition, we formalize and prove important equivalence rules for tensor expressions and highlight their relevance in practical applications.</description>
