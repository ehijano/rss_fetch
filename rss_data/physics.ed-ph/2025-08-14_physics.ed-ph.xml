      <title>From Self-Crafted to Engineered Prompts: Student Evaluations of AI-Generated Feedback in Introductory Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abilities of Generative-Artificial Intelligence (AI) to produce real-time, sophisticated responses across diverse contexts has promised a huge potential in physics education, particularly in providing customized feedback. In this study, we investigate around 1200 introductory students' preferences about AI-feedback generated from three distinct prompt types: (a) self-crafted, (b) entailing foundational prompt-engineering techniques, and (c) entailing foundational prompt-engineering techniques along with principles of effective-feedback. The results highlight an overwhelming fraction of students preferring feedback generated using structured prompts, with those entailing combined features of prompt engineering and effective feedback to be favored most. However, the popular choice also elicited stronger preferences with students either liking or disliking the feedback. Students also ranked the feedback generated using their self-crafted prompts as the least preferred choice. Students' second preferences given their first choice and implications of the results such as the need to incorporate prompt engineering in introductory courses are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reducing the weight of low exam scores may raise average grades but does not appear to impact equity gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Students interpret grades as signals of their strengths, and grades inform students' decisions about majors and courses of study. Differences in grades that are not related to learning can impact this judgment and have real-world impact on course-taking and careers. Existing work has examined how an overemphasis on high-stakes exams can create equity gaps where female students and Black, Hispanic, and Native American students earn lower grades than male students and Asian and white students, respectively. Yet, minimal work has examined how the weighting of individual midterm exam scores can also contribute to equity gaps. In this work, we examine how three midterm exam score aggregation methods for final grades affect equity gaps. We collected midterm exam data from approximately 6,000 students in an introductory physics course over 6 years at a large, research-intensive university. Using this data set, we applied common midterm exam score aggregation methods to determine their impact on aggregated midterm exam grades: dropping the lowest midterm exam score, replacing the lowest midterm exam score with the final exam score if higher, and counting the highest midterm exam score more in the final grade calculation than the lowest midterm exam score. We find that dropping the lowest midterm exam score resulted in the largest increase in final grades, with students with lower grades benefiting the most. However, we find limited evidence that alternative midterm exam aggregation methods could close equity gaps. Implementing the alternative midterm exam aggregation methods examined here may be useful for instructors wanting to raise course grades or give lower-scoring students a boost. However, they do not appear to be effective in reducing equity gaps.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a deliberate-practice informed supplemental intervention in graduate Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the prevalence of physics education research literature related to problem solving, recent studies have illustrated that opportunities for ``authentic'' problem solving -- conceptualized as making decisions with limited information using one's physics knowledge -- are limited at both the graduate and undergraduate levels in physics curricula. Building on one of these studies, we designed a supplemental intervention for a graduate-level quantum mechanics course which scaffolded the practice of making some of these critical decisions using the conceptual framework of deliberate practice. Despite similar incentive structures as prior interventions focused on conceptual understanding in similar contexts, we did not measure any statistically significant improvement in students' problem solving skills following our intervention, though faculty members involved with the next course and written qualifying exams indicated the students showed better-than-usual conceptual understanding. We explore a number of potential explanations for this disconnect and suggest future avenues of research in this area.</description>

      <title>Emergent Explicit Regulation in College Students Collaborative Scientific Inquiry Learning, Framework and A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small group activities have been widely adopted in college level science courses. As students participate in these activities, it is important to consider how group members collectively regulate their activity and complete group task. Regulation in a group often involves adaptive responsivity from group members when they notice and deal with a challenge. The theoretical framework of socially shared regulation emphasizes group members collaboratively regulating within the group but does not focus on portraying how the shared regulation is developed in the moment. Currently, the field lacks a framework characterizing the momentary development of a regulatory action in a group. Our study addresses this gap. In our video data, incoming college students were enrolled in a summer program designed to promote students metacognitive skills to be incorporated in their study of science. We have observed various moments in which the students spontaneously made a move to regulate the hands-on, inquiry activity in completing their tasks and achieving group goals. We developed a framework called Emergent Explicit Regulation to characterize those moments. The EER framework captures students in the moment regulatory moves to respond to a challenge, articulating how those moves emerge, in what ways they are explicit and regulatory. In this paper, we first introduce the EER framework and situate the EER framework in the context of collaborative scientific inquiry learning. We then present a case study where we applied the EER framework to identify typical EER instances in one small group when the students completed the task of building a model to represent the climate of the Earth atmosphere. They worked collaboratively, faced and handled various challenges, completed the group task, and demonstrated multiple EERs in different psychological areas and in the inquiry practices designed in the activity.</description>

      <title>Psychometric Evaluation of the Culture around Systemic Change Survey: A tool for Assessing Departmental Culture in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics programs are continually evolving to better support student learning and meet the diverse needs of their populations. Achieving many of these goals requires not only structural adjustments but also fundamental shifts in departmental culture. Recognizing this, disciplinary organizations in physics have placed systemic change and equity at the center of reform efforts, identifying them as essential pillars of meaningful and sustainable change. Yet tools for assessing departmental culture around educational change remain limited. In this study, we introduce the Culture around Systemic Change Survey (CSCS), a new instrument designed to measure faculty and staff perceptions of their department's "current" and "ideal" states. Using responses from the "current" scale only (N=111 participants across 33 departments), we conducted a psychometric evaluation of the CSCS. Exploratory factor analysis supported a five-factor structure, including Open-Mindedness (OM), Student Involvement (SI), Collective Interpretation of Evidence (CE), Sustainability (S), and Disruption of Systemic Injustices (DI). As survey development is an iterative process, future work will focus on refinement and confirmatory analysis. This work sets the foundation for conducting population studies that assess the state of progress of the physics community along an equitable and systemic culture to pursuing educational change.</description>
