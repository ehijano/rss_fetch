      <title>A Wideband Tunable, Nonreciprocal Bandpass Filter Using Magnetostatic Surface Waves with Zero Static Power Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern wireless systems demand compact, power-efficient RF front-end components that support wideband tunability and nonreciprocity. We present a new class of miniature bandpass filter that achieves both continuously tunable frequency operation (4-17.7 GHz) and high nonreciprocity (&gt;25 dB), all within a compact size of 1.07 cm3. The filter employs a microfabricated 18 micrometer thick Yttrium Iron Garnet waveguide with meander-line aluminum transducers, enabling low-loss unidirectional propagation via magnetostatic surface waves. Leveraging a benzocyclobutene planarization fabrication process, this study enables a dispersion profile unique to thick YIG films, resulting in enhanced filter skirt performance with minimal spurious modes. Frequency tuning is enabled by a zero-static-power magnetic bias circuit using transient current pulses, eliminating continuous power consumption. The filter demonstrates low insertion loss (3-5 dB), high out-of-band rejection (&gt;30 dB), narrow bandwidth (100-200 MHz), and robust power handling (&gt;10.4 dBm).</description>

      <title>UV-SERS monitoring of plasmons photodegradation of biomolecules on Aluminum platforms decorated with Rhodium nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for novel nanostructured materials for UV plasmonics a limited number of choices can be done. Materials such as aluminum, rhodium, gallium and few others can be used. One of the most interesting application for UV plasmonics is Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy. It can be extended to this spectral range to explore spectral properties of biomolecules that have only a small cross section in the visible spectral range. We have recently reported on a functional substrates based on nanoporous aluminum decorated with rhodium nanoparticles. This system showed an interesting behavior for UV excitation at 266 nm, with an unexpected decreasing Raman intensity for increasing rhodium nanoparticles concentrations. We proposed that this effect can be due to the difficult access to the hot spots for the molecules deposited via thermal evaporation. Here we extend this study exploring the performance of the system at another UV excitation wavelengths (325 nm) reporting on experimental results obtained using a deposition process that can bring the molecules at the hot-spots in a more efficient way. Extensive spectroscopic acquisitions, combined with 3D maps, allow to shade a more clear view on the performance of this plasmonic platform. In particular, the photodegration and the potential oxidation of biomolecules driven by the hot-electron/hot-holes produced by the rhodium nanoparticles will be reported.</description>

      <title>High-endurance mechanical switching in a DNA origami snap-through mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Switchable elements are key components of dynamic technological and biological systems, enabling reversible transitions between well-defined states. Here, we present a DNA origami-based, mechanically bistable snap-through mechanism that can be electrically controlled. This nanoscale switch exhibits long-term stability in both states in the absence of external stimuli, while achieving millisecond-scale switching times upon application of an electric field. Individual devices sustain hundreds of thousands of switching cycles over several hours, offering a powerful platform for systematically studying the endurance and failure mechanisms of biomolecular nanoswitches. Functionalization with a gold nanorod further allows polarization-dependent optical modulation, opening avenues for applications in plasmonics. This versatile electromechanical interface has potential uses in molecular information processing, optical nanodevices, and the dynamic control of chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Antibunched emission from femtosecond laser-written nano-ablations on gallium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser-writing offers distinct capabilities for fabrication, including three-dimensional, multi-material, and sub-diffraction-limited patterning. In particular, demonstrations of laser-written quantum emitters and photonic devices with superior optical properties have attracted attention. Recently, gallium nitride (GaN) has been reported to host quantum emitters with narrow and bright zero-phonon photoluminescence from ultraviolet to telecom ranges. However, emitters formed during epitaxy are randomly positioned, and until now, it has not been possible to fabricate quantum emitters in ordered arrays. In this paper, we employ femtosecond laser writing to create nano-ablations with sub-diffraction-limited diameter, and use rapid thermal annealing to activate co-located stable emitters. The emitters show MHz antibunched emission with a sharp spectral peak at room temperature. Our study not only presents an efficient approach to laser-written nanofabrication on GaN but also offers a promising pathway for the deterministic creation of quantum emitters in GaN, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms involved.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Model of Acoustic Power Transfer Through Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic Power Transfer is a relatively new technology. It is a modern type of a wireless interface, where data signals and supply voltages are transmitted, with the use of mechanical waves, through a medium. The simplest application of such systems is the measurement of frequency response for audio speakers. It consists of a variable signal generator, a measuring amplifier which drives an acoustic source and the loudspeaker driver. The receiver contains a microphone circuit with a level recorder. Acoustic Power Transfer could have many applications, such as: Cochlear Implants, Sonar Systems and Wireless Charging. However, it is a new technology, thus it needs further investigation.</description>

      <title>Lean CNNs for mapping electron charge density fields to material properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a lean CNN (convolutional neural network) framework, with a drastically reduced number of fittable parameters (&lt;81K) compared to the benchmarks in current literature, to capture the underlying low-computational cost (i.e., surrogate) relationships between the electron charge density (ECD) fields and their associated effective properties. These lean CNNs are made possible by adding a pre-processing step (i.e., a feature engineering step) that involves the computation of the ECD fields' spatial correlations (specifically, 2-point spatial correlations). The viability and benefits of the proposed lean CNN framework are demonstrated by establishing robust structure-property relationships involving the prediction of effective material properties using the feature-engineered ECD fields as the only input. The framework is evaluated on a dataset of crystalline cubic systems consisting of 1410 molecular structures spanning 62 different elemental species and 3 space groups.</description>

      <title>A magnetically levitated conducting rotor with ultra-low rotational damping circumventing eddy loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levitation in vacuum of macroscopic objects is key towards the development of novel types of inertial sensors and pressure sensors, as well as towards the fundamental studies of quantum mechanics and its relation to gravity. Diamagnetic levitation offers a passive method at room temperature to isolate macroscopic objects in vacuum environments, yet eddy current damping remains a critical limitation for electrically conductive materials. We show that there are situations where the motion of conductors in magnetic fields do not, in principal, produce eddy damping, and demonstrate an electrically conducting rotor diamagnetically levitated in an axially symmetric magnetic field in high vacuum. Experimental measurements and finite-element simulations reveal gas collision damping as the dominant loss mechanism at high pressures, while residual eddy damping, which arises from symmetry-breaking factors such as platform tilt or material imperfections, dominates at low pressures. This demonstrates a macroscopic levitated rotor with extremely low rotational damping, and paves the way to fully suppress rotor damping, enabling ultra-low-loss rotors for gyroscopes, pressure sensing, and fundamental physics tests.</description>

      <title>Optical Kerr soliton microcombs for high bandwidth communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microcombs, optical frequency combs generated by nonlinear integrated micro-cavity resonators, have the potential to offer the full capability of their benchtop comb based counterparts, but in an integrated footprint. They have enabled breakthroughs in spectroscopy, microwave photonics, frequency synthesis, optical ranging, quantum state generation and manipulation, metrology, optical neuromorphic processing and more. One of their most promising applications has been optical fibre communications where they have formed the basis for massively parallel ultrahigh capacity multiplexed data transmission. Innovative approaches have been used in recent years to phaselock, or modelock different types of microcombs, from dissipative Kerr solitons to dark solitons, soliton crystals and others. This has enabled their use as sources for optical communications including advanced coherent modulation format systems that have achieved ultrahigh data capacity bit rates breaking the petabit/s barrier. Here, we review this new and exciting field, chronicling the progress while highlighting the challenges and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast excitation of polar skyrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.</description>

Abstract: Finding the right material platform for engineering efficient photonic interfaces to solid state emitters has been a long-standing bottleneck for scaling up solid state quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that nitrogen-rich silicon nitride, with its low background auto-fluorescence at visible wavelengths, is a viable quantum photonics platform by showing that nitrogen vacancy centres embedded in nanodiamonds preserve both their quantum optical and spin properties post-encapsulation. Given the variety of high-performance photonic components already demonstrated in silicon nitride, our work opens up a new avenue for building integrated photonic circuits using solid state emitters.</description>

      <title>Coherent heat transfer leads to genuine quantum enhancement in the performances of continuous engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional continuous quantum heat engines with incoherent heat transfer perform poorly as they exploit two-body interactions between the system and hot or cold baths, thus having limited capability to outperform their classical counterparts. We introduce distinct continuous quantum heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding genuine quantum enhancement in performance. These coherent engines consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. We demonstrate that coherent engines deliver significantly higher power output with much greater reliability, i.e., lower signal-to-noise ratio of the power, by hundreds of folds over their incoherent counterparts. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to or at the maximal achievable reliability allowed by the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Moreover, coherent engines manifest more nonclassical features than incoherent engines because they violate the classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a wider range of parameters. These genuine enhancements in the performance of coherent engines are directly attributed to their capacity to harness higher energetic coherence for the resonant driving case. The experimental feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum properties can enhance performance may find applications in quantum-enabled technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animals achieve robust locomotion by offloading regulation from the brain to physical couplings within the body. In contrast, locomotion in artificial systems often depends on centralized processors. We introduce a rapid and autonomous locomotion strategy with synchronized gaits emerging through physical interactions between self-oscillating limbs and the environment, without control signals. Each limb is a single soft tube that only requires constant flow of air to perform cyclic stepping motions at frequencies reaching 300 hertz. By combining several of these self-oscillating limbs, their physical synchronization enables locomotion speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than comparable state-of-the-art. Through body-environment dynamics, these seemingly simple devices exhibit autonomy, including obstacle avoidance, amphibious gait transitions, and phototaxis.</description>

      <title>Optimal structured light waves generation in 3D volumes using communication mode optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise control of light intensity in 3D volumes is highly in demand in many applications in optics. Various wavefront shaping techniques have been utilized to reconstruct a target amplitude profile within a 3D space. However, these techniques are intrinsically limited by cross-talk and often rely on optimization methods to improve the quality of the reconstruction. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a new wavefront shaping method based on interfering the optimum orthogonal communication modes connecting a source plane and a receiving volume. These optimum modes are computed from the singular value decomposition of a coupling operator that connects each point at the source plane to another one in the receiving volume. The modes comprise a pair of source and receiving eigenfunctions, with each forming a complete orthogonal basis for their respective spaces. We utilize these modes to construct arbitrarily chosen 2D and 3D structured light waves within the output receiving volume and optically generate these waves using a spatial light modulator. Our generated intensity profiles exhibit low cross-talk, high fidelity, and high contrast. We envision our work to inspire new directions in any domain that requires controlling light intensity in 3D with high precision and also to serve as a benchmark for other wavefront shaping techniques.</description>

      <title>Efficiency Enhancement of c-Si/TiO$_2$ Heterojunction Thin Film Solar Cell Using Hybrid Metal-Dielectric Nanostructures</title>

Abstract: The hybrid metal-dielectric nanostructures (HMDN) are promising candidates to address the ohmic loss by conventional nanostructures in photovoltaic applications by strong confinement and high scattering directivity. In this study, we present a c-Si/TiO$_2$ heterojunction thin film solar cell (TFSC) where a pair of triangular HMDN comprised of Ag and AZO was utilized to enhance the longer wavelength light absorption. The presence of the TiO$_2$ inverted pyramid layer, in combination with the ITO and SiO$_2$-based pyramid layers at the front, enhanced the shorter wavelength light absorption by increasing the optical path and facilitating the coupling of incoming light in photonic mode. Consequently, the average absorption by 1000 nm thick photoactive layer reached 83.32 % for AM 1.5G within the wavelength range of 300 - 1100 nm which was investigated by employing the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The electric field profile and current density profile demonstrated the respective contributions of each layer in the absorption of light at shorter and longer wavelengths. The structure exhibited a short circuit current density ($J_{sc}$) of 37.96 mA/cm$^2$ and a power conversion efficiency ($PCE$) of 17.42 %. The efficiency of our proposed structure experienced a maximum relative change of 0.34 % when a polarized light was exposed with an angle of 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$. The incorporation of self-heating in non-isothermal conditions reduced $PCE$ by $13.77 \%$. In addition, the comparative analysis to assess the impact of HMDN on our structure revealed a $4.54 \%$ increase in $PCE$ of the structure with metallic nanostructures, paving the way for the utilization of HMDN to enhance the performance of TFSC.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond and attosecond phase-space correlations in few-particle photoelectron pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal correlations in pulsed electron beams reflect the microscopic dynamics of emission and interparticle interaction. In femtosecond electron emission from nanoscale field emitters, Coulomb interactions result in structured few-electron states with strong correlations in energy, time, and transverse momentum. Interactions with external fields may be used to both probe and further manipulate these correlated states. Here, we combine femtosecond-gated, event-based detection with inelastic electron-light scattering to directly map the photoelectron phase-space distribution of two-electron states. Our experiments demonstrate a bimodal structure in longitudinal phase space, with distinct contributions from interparticle interaction and dispersion. Moreover, we theoretically reveal that global phase modulation coherently shapes the few-electron phase-space distribution to exhibit attosecond temporal correlations. This controlled phasing of few-electron states can be harnessed to produce tailored excitations and super-radiance via two-electron energy post-selection.</description>

      <title>Quantum charge sensing using a semiconductor device based on $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a nanoscale device concept based on a highly doped $\delta$-layer tunnel junction embedded in a semiconductor for charge sensing. Recent advances in Atomic Precision Advanced Manufacturing (APAM) processes have enabled the fabrication of devices based on quasi-2D, highly conductive, highly doped regions, known as $\delta$-layers, in semiconductor materials. In this work, we demonstrate that APAM $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions are ultrasensitive to the presence of charges near the tunnel junction, allowing the use of these devices for detecting charges by observing changes in the electrical current. We demonstrate that these devices can enhance the sensitivity in the limit, i.e., for small concentrations of charges, exhibiting significantly superior sensitivity compared to traditional FET-based sensors. We also propose that the extreme sensitivity arises from the strong quantization of the conduction band in these highly-confined systems.</description>

      <title>Compact superconducting vacuum-gap capacitors with low microwave loss and high mechanical coherence for scalable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vacuum-gap capacitors have recently attracted significant interest in superconducting circuit platforms due to their compact design and exceptionally low dielectric losses in the microwave regime. Their intrinsic ability to support mechanical vibrational modes makes them well-suited for circuit optomechanics. However, precise control over the gap size and the realization of high-coherence mechanical modes remain longstanding challenges. Here, we present a detailed and scalable fabrication process for vacuum-gap capacitors that support ultra-high-coherence mechanical motion, exhibit low microwave loss, and occupy a significantly smaller footprint compared to conventional planar geometries. By employing a planarized $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ sacrificial layer, we achieve vacuum gaps on the order of 150 nm. Using this platform, we have recently demonstrated ground-state cooling and motion squeezing of a mechanical oscillator with a quality factor of 40 million, a 100-fold improvement compared to prior works, as well as a single-photon optomechanical coupling rate of approximately 15Hz. Additional achievements include the realization of an optomechanical topological lattice with 24 sites and the observation of quantum collective dynamics in a mechanical hexamer. Collectively, these results underscore the potential of vacuum-gap capacitors as a platform for coupling superconducting qubits to mechanical systems, enabling quantum storage, and probing gravitational effects in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Transforming physics-informed machine learning to convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) offers a powerful paradigm of integrating data with physical laws to address important scientific problems, such as parameter estimation, inferring hidden physics, equation discovery, and state prediction, etc. However, PIML still faces many serious optimization challenges that significantly restrict its applications. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization to overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear combination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the convexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the loss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into a sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems. This conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization algorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an adaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to mitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance. The proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with distinct types of physical prior. The results indicate that optimization problems are effectively solved in these scenarios, highlighting the potential of the framework for broad applications.</description>
