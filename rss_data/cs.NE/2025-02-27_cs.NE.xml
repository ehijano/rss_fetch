      <title>NeuroTree: Hierarchical Functional Brain Pathway Decoding for Mental Health Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing functional brain networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for understanding psychiatric disorders and addictive behaviors. While existing fMRI-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs) show considerable promise for feature extraction, they often fall short in characterizing complex relationships between brain regions and demographic factors and accounting for interpretable variables linked to psychiatric conditions. We propose NeuroTree to overcome these limitations, integrating a k-hop AGE-GCN with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This framework leverages an attention mechanism to optimize functional connectivity (FC), thereby enhancing dynamic FC feature learning for brain disease classification. Furthermore, NeuroTree effectively decodes fMRI network features into tree structures, which improves the capture of high-order brain regional pathway features and enables the identification of hierarchical neural behavioral patterns essential for understanding disease-related brain subnetworks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuroTree achieves state-of-the-art performance across two distinct mental disorder datasets and provides valuable insights into age-related deterioration patterns. These findings underscore the model's efficacy in predicting psychiatric disorders and elucidating their underlying neural mechanisms.</description>

      <title>On the Privacy-Preserving Properties of Spiking Neural Networks with Unique Surrogate Gradients and Quantization Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models increasingly process sensitive data, understanding their vulnerability to privacy attacks is vital. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit model responses to infer whether specific data points were used during training, posing a significant privacy risk. Prior research suggests that spiking neural networks (SNNs), which rely on event-driven computation and discrete spike-based encoding, exhibit greater resilience to MIAs than artificial neural networks (ANNs). This resilience stems from their non-differentiable activations and inherent stochasticity, which obscure the correlation between model responses and individual training samples. To enhance privacy in SNNs, we explore two techniques: quantization and surrogate gradients. Quantization, which reduces precision to limit information leakage, has improved privacy in ANNs. Given SNNs' sparse and irregular activations, quantization may further disrupt the activation patterns exploited by MIAs. We assess the vulnerability of SNNs and ANNs under weight and activation quantization across multiple datasets, using the attack model's receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric, where lower values indicate stronger privacy, and evaluate the privacy-accuracy trade-off. Our findings show that quantization enhances privacy in both architectures with minimal performance loss, though full-precision SNNs remain more resilient than quantized ANNs. Additionally, we examine the impact of surrogate gradients on privacy in SNNs. Among five evaluated gradients, spike rate escape provides the best privacy-accuracy trade-off, while arctangent increases vulnerability to MIAs. These results reinforce SNNs' inherent privacy advantages and demonstrate that quantization and surrogate gradient selection significantly influence privacy-accuracy trade-offs in SNNs.</description>

      <title>Blending Optimal Control and Biologically Plausible Learning for Noise-Robust Physical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational demands for artificial intelligence (AI) have spurred the exploration of computing principles beyond conventional digital computers. Physical neural networks (PNNs) offer efficient neuromorphic information processing by harnessing the innate computational power of physical processes; however, training their weight parameters is computationally expensive. We propose a training approach for substantially reducing this training cost. Our training approach merges an optimal control method for continuous-time dynamical systems with a biologically plausible training method--direct feedback alignment. In addition to the reduction of training time, this approach achieves robust processing even under measurement errors and noise without requiring detailed system information. The effectiveness was numerically and experimentally verified in an optoelectronic delay system. Our approach significantly extends the range of physical systems practically usable as PNNs.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Language Evolution under Regulated Social Media Platforms: A Synergistic Approach of Large Language Models and Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms frequently impose restrictive policies to moderate user content, prompting the emergence of creative evasion language strategies. This paper presents a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the iterative evolution of language strategies under regulatory constraints. In this framework, participant agents, as social media users, continuously evolve their language expression, while supervisory agents emulate platform-level regulation by assessing policy violations. To achieve a more faithful simulation, we employ a dual design of language strategies (constraint and expression) to differentiate conflicting goals and utilize an LLM-driven GA (Genetic Algorithm) for the selection, mutation, and crossover of language strategies. The framework is evaluated using two distinct scenarios: an abstract password game and a realistic simulated illegal pet trade scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that as the number of dialogue rounds increases, both the number of uninterrupted dialogue turns and the accuracy of information transmission improve significantly. Furthermore, a user study with 40 participants validates the real-world relevance of the generated dialogues and strategies. Moreover, ablation studies validate the importance of the GA, emphasizing its contribution to long-term adaptability and improved overall results.</description>

      <title>SAN: Hypothesizing Long-Term Synaptic Development and Neural Engram Mechanism in Scalable Model's Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) bridged the performance gap with Full Fine-Tuning (FFT) through sophisticated analysis of pre-trained parameter spaces. Starting from drawing insights from Neural Engrams (NE) in Biological Neural Networks (BNNs), we establish a connection between the low-rank property observed during PEFT's parameter space shifting and neurobiological mechanisms. This observation leads to our proposed method, Synapse and Neuron (SAN), which decomposes and propagates scaling components from anterior feature adjusting vectors towards posterior weight matrices. Our approach is theoretically grounded in Long-Term Potentiation/Depression (LTP/D) phenomena, which govern synapse development through neurotransmitter release modulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness: on \textbf{vision tasks} across VTAB, FGVC, and GIC (25 datasets) using ViT, SwinT and ConvNeXt, SAN outperforms FFT up to 8.7% and LoRA by 3.2%; on language tasks using Commonsense Reasoning (8 datasets) with LLaMA models (all generations), surpassing ChatGPT up to 8.5% and LoRA by 4.7%; on visual-language tasks using Mixed Visual Instruction (7 datasets) with LLaVA models, it exceeds FFT up to 2.4% and LoRA by 1.9%. Our code and W&amp;B log will be released.</description>

      <title>Activation degree thresholds and expressiveness of polynomial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks through the geometry of their neurovariety. We introduce the notion of the activation degree threshold of a network architecture to express when the dimension of the neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. We prove the existence of the activation degree threshold for all polynomial neural networks without width-one bottlenecks and demonstrate a universal upper bound that is quadratic in the width of largest size. In doing so, we prove the high activation degree conjecture of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna. Certain structured architectures have exceptional activation degree thresholds, making them especially expressive in the sense of their neurovariety dimension. In this direction, we prove that polynomial neural networks with equi-width architectures are maximally expressive by showing their activation degree threshold is one.</description>

      <title>ART: Actually Robust Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current interest in deep learning captures the attention of many programmers and researchers. Unfortunately, the lack of a unified schema for developing deep learning models results in methodological inconsistencies, unclear documentation, and problems with reproducibility. Some guidelines have been proposed, yet currently, they lack practical implementations. Furthermore, neural network training often takes on the form of trial and error, lacking a structured and thoughtful process. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we introduce Art, a Python library designed to help automatically impose rules and standards while developing deep learning pipelines. Art divides model development into a series of smaller steps of increasing complexity, each concluded with a validation check improving the interpretability and robustness of the process. The current version of Art comes equipped with nine predefined steps inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Recipe for Training Neural Networks, a visualization dashboard, and integration with loggers such as Neptune. The code related to this paper is available at: https://github.com/SebChw/Actually-Robust-Training.</description>

      <title>Associative memory and dead neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In "Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning," Dmitry Krotov and John Hopfield introduced a general technique for the systematic construction of neural ordinary differential equations with non-increasing energy or Lyapunov function. We study this energy function and identify that it is vulnerable to the problem of dead neurons. Each point in the state space where the neuron dies is contained in a non-compact region with constant energy. In these flat regions, energy function alone does not completely determine all degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, can not be used to analyze stability or find steady states or basins of attraction. We perform a direct analysis of the dynamical system and show how to resolve problems caused by flat directions corresponding to dead neurons: (i) all information about the state vector at a fixed point can be extracted from the energy and Hessian matrix (of Lagrange function), (ii) it is enough to analyze stability in the range of Hessian matrix, (iii) if steady state touching flat region is stable the whole flat region is the basin of attraction. The analysis of the Hessian matrix can be complicated for realistic architectures, so we show that for a slightly altered dynamical system (with the same structure of steady states), one can derive a diverse family of Lyapunov functions that do not have flat regions corresponding to dead neurons. In addition, these energy functions allow one to use Lagrange functions with Hessian matrices that are not necessarily positive definite and even consider architectures with non-symmetric feedforward and feedback connections.</description>
