      <title>Improving Radial Velocities by Marginalizing over Stars and Sky: Achieving 30 m/s RV Precision for APOGEE in the Plate Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radial velocity catalog from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is unique in its simultaneously large volume and high precision as a result of its decade-long survey duration, multiplexing (600 fibers), and spectral resolution of $R \sim 22,500$. However, previous data reductions of APOGEE have not fully realized the potential radial velocity (RV) precision of the instrument. Here we present an RV catalog based on a new reduction of all 2.6 million visits of APOGEE DR17 and validate it against improved estimates for the theoretical RV performance. The core ideas of the new reduction are the simultaneous modeling of all components in the spectra, rather than a separate subtraction of point estimates for the sky, and a marginalization over stellar types, rather than a grid search for an optimum. We show that this catalog, when restricted to RVs measured with the same fiber, achieves noise-limited precision down to 30 m/s and delivers well-calibrated uncertainties. We also introduce a general method for calibrating fiber-to-fiber constant RV offsets and demonstrate its importance for high RV precision work in multi-fiber spectrographs. After calibration, we achieve 47 m/s RV precision on the combined catalog with RVs measured with different fibers. This degradation in precision relative to measurements with only a single fiber suggests that refining line spread function models should be a focus in SDSS-V to improve the fiber-unified RV catalog.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Technology To Prepare For The Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here the current state of a collection of promising ultraviolet technologies in preparation for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Working with experts representing a significant number of groups working in the ultraviolet, we summarize some of the leading science drivers, present an argument for a 100 angstrom blue wavelength cutoff, and gather current state of the art of UV technologies. We present the state of the art of contamination control, a crucial piece of the UV instrument plan. We explore next steps with individual technologies, as well as present paths forward with systems level testing and development.</description>

      <title>Frequency Shift in Binary Lensing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing with binary lensing is one of the channels for detecting exoplanets. Due to the degeneracy of the lens parameters for the binary microlensing, additional features such as parallax and finite-size effects need to identify the lens parameters. The frequency-shift effect as the relativistic analogy of the gravity assist for the photons, is an extra observation that provides additional constraint between the lens parameters . In this work, we extend the application of the frequency shift effect to binary microlensing and derive the frequency shift during the lensing and caustic crossing. The frequency shift for the binary lens is of the order of ${\Delta\nu}/{\nu}\sim 10^{-12}$. We also investigate the feasibility of detecting this effect by employing Cross-Correlation methods .</description>

      <title>Debiasing astro-Photometric Observations with Corrections Using Statistics (DePhOCUS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photometric measurements allow the determination of an asteroid's absolute magnitude, which often represents the sole means to infer its size. Photometric observations can be obtained in a variety of filters that can be unique to a specific observatory. Those observations are then calibrated into specific bands with respect to reference star catalogs. In order to combine all the different measurements for evaluation, photometric observations need to be converted to a common band, typically V-band. Current band-correction schemes in use by IAU's Minor Planet Center, JPL's Center for Near Earth Object Studies and ESA's NEO Coordination Centre use average correction values for the apparent magnitude derived from photometry of asteroids as the corrections are dependent on the typically unknown spectrum of the object to be corrected. By statistically analyzing the photometric residuals of asteroids, we develop a new photometric correction scheme that does not only consider the band, but also accounts for reference catalog and observatory. We describe a new statistical photometry correction scheme for asteroid observations with debiased corrections. Testing this scheme on a reference group of asteroids, we see a 36% reduction in the photometric residuals. Moreover, the new scheme leads to a more accurate and debiased determination of the H-G magnitude system and, in turn, to more reliable inferred sizes. We discuss the significant shift in the corrections with this "DePhOCUS" debiasing system, its limitations, and the impact for photometric and physical properties of all asteroids, especially Near-Earth Objects.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Light Curve Parameter Estimation Using Likelihood-Free Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a parameter estimation algorithm on kilonova light curves using likelihood-free inference. Our inference is optimized through a pre-trained embedding network that marginalizes the time of arrival and the luminosity distance of the signal. We find that parameter inference utilizing a pre-trained embedding outperforms the use of likelihood-free inference alone, reducing training time and offering the capability to marginalize over certain nuisance parameters. The model is capable of retrieving the intrinsic parameters of the kilonova light curves with a comparable accuracy and precision to nested sampling methods while taking significantly less computational time. This framework has been integrated into the publicly available Nuclear Multi-Messenger Astronomy codebase so users can leverage the model for their inference purposes. This algorithm is broadly applicable to parameterized or simulated light curves of other transient objects.</description>
