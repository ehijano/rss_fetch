      <title>Meromorphic solutions of a certain type of nonlinear differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our paper focuses on investigating the existence and possible forms of solutions to the nonlinear differential equation \beas f^m+\big(Rf^{(k)}\big)^n=Qe^{\alpha},\eeas where where $k$, $m$ and $n$ are three positive integers, $Q$ and $R$ are non-zero rational functions, and $\alpha$ is a polynomial. We examine this equation systematically for all positive integral values of $k$, $m$ and $n$, providing comprehensive conditions under which entire or meromorphic solutions may exist. Our results offer substantial improvements over those of Tang and Liao \cite{TL1} and Han and L\"{u} \cite{HL1}, particularly with respect to the existence criteria and the explicit analytic forms of admissible solutions. These findings contribute meaningfully to the broader study of nonlinear differential polynomials and Fermat-type functional equations in complex analysis.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional analogues of the refined Bohr type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to establish a sharp improvement of the classical Bohr inequality for bounded holomorphic mappings in the polydisk $\mathbb{D}^n$.We also prove two other sharp versions of the Bohr inequality in the setting of several complex variables: one by replacing the constant term with the absolute value of the function, and another by replacing it with the square of the absolute value of the function.Furthermore, we establish multidimensional analogues of known results concerning the modulus of the derivative of analytic functions in the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$, replacing the derivative with the radial derivative of holomorphic functions in $\mathbb{D}^n$.All of the established results are shown to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Volterra-Type Integral Operators on Hardy Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $n$-fold iterated Volterra-type integral operator $T_{g,n}$ acting on Hardy spaces, defined by \[ T_{g,n}[f](z) :=\underbrace{\int_0^z\int_0^{t_1}\cdots\int_0^{t_{n-1}}}_{n\ \text{times}} f(t_n)g'(t_n)\,dt_n\cdots dt_1, \quad z\in\mathbb{D}, \] where $f$ and $g$ are analytic functions in the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. We show that the boundedness and compactness of $T_{g,n}$ are independent of the order $n$ and depend solely on the symbol $g$. In particular, we obtain sharp norm estimates and characterize boundedness and compactness of $T_{g,n}$ in terms of classical function space conditions on $g$.</description>

      <title>On the distribution kernels of Toeplitz operators on CR manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution kernel of a Toeplitz operator associated with a classical pseudodifferential operator on a compact, embeddable, strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold. The main result consists of a formula for the values at the diagonal of the second coefficient in the expansion of the symbol of the kernel. We also establish asymptotic expansions for Toeplitz operators on the positive part of a compact not necessary strictly pseudoconvex CR orbifold under certain natural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Fokas-type closed-form solution formulae for Sobolev-type equations with time-dependent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically derive novel explicit integral representations for the solution of nonhomogeneous initial-boundary-value problems for a large category of evolution partial differential equations of Sobolev-Galpern type with generic temporally variable coefficients, satisfying suitable mild conditions, and with arbitrary data in classical function spaces. This work is based on the careful implementation of the pioneering Fokas unified transform methodology alongside its recently-proposed extension for solving a class of linear evolution equations with dispersion relation of specific polynomial type and time-dependent coefficients. We herein effectively extend those techniques to a special collection of evolution equations with time-dependent coefficients and mixed spatiotemporal derivatives, which induce rational dispersion relations. The new approach is exhibited in detail through illustrative generation of closed-form solutions for a multitude of such equations (such as Milne-Taylor-Barenblatt-Coleman-Ting-Chen-type, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-type, as well as numerous higher-order variants) posed on the half-line. Challenging technical difficulties of complex-analytic and of algebraic flavour naturally emerge due the presence of mixed-derivative terms, and these are appropriately resolved in each case. The new formulas are of utility in subsequent investigation of qualitative properties and analysis of nonlinear counterparts too. Further extensions, generalizations, rigorous aspects and implementations to other types of problems as well will soon be reported in forthcoming publications.</description>

      <title>Iterated function systems of holomorphic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unify and advance a host of works on iterated function systems of holomorphic self-maps of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. Our foremost result is a generalisation to left iterated function systems of an unpublished and little known theorem of Heins on iteration in the unit disc. Applications abound -- to work of Benini et al. on transcendental dynamics, to the theory of hyperbolic steps of holomorphic maps, and to left semiconjugacy in the unit disc. We extend other work of Benini et al. and Ferreira on relatively compact left iterated function systems, and we prove a hyperbolic distance inequality for holomorphic maps that generalises a theorem of Bracci, Kraus, and Roth. Additionally, we strengthen results of the first author and Christodoulou on left iterated function systems, removing the need for Bloch domains, and we answer an open question from their work. Finally, we establish a version of the Heins theorem for right iterated functions systems, and we generalise theorems of Beardon and Kuznetsov on right iterated function systems in relatively compact semigroups of holomorphic maps.</description>

      <title>Functional equation for LC-functions with even or odd modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, we introduced \textit{LC-functions} $L(s,f)$, associated to a certain real-analytic function $f$ at $0$, extending the concept of the Hurwitz zeta function and its formula. In this paper, we establish the existence of a functional equation for a specific class of LC-functions. More precisely, we demonstrate that if the function $p_f(t):=f(t)(e^t-1)/t$, called the \textit{modulator} of $L(s,f)$, exhibits even or odd symmetry, the \textit{LC-function formula} -- a generalization of the Hurwitz formula -- naturally simplifies to a functional equation analogous to that of the Dirichlet L-function $L(s,\chi)$, associated to a primitive character $\chi$ of inherent parity. Furthermore, using this equation, we derive a general formula for the values of these LC-functions at even or odd positive integers, depending on whether the modulator $p_f$ is even or odd, respectively. Two illustrative examples of the functional equation are provided for distinct parity of modulators.</description>

      <title>Free infinite divisibility, fractional convolution powers, and Appell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Initiated by a result of Gorin and Marcus [Int. Math. Res. Not., (3):883--913, 2020] and an observation of Steinerberger [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 147(11):4733--4744, 2019], there has been a recent growing body of literature connecting repeated differentiation of polynomials to free additive convolution semigroups in free probability. Roughly, this connection states that in the large degree limit the empirical measure of the roots after many derivatives is, up to a rescaling, the original empirical measure of the roots raised to a free additive convolution power. If the original real roots satisfy some bounds and the number of derivatives is such that the remaining degree is fixed, then these high derivatives converge to the Hermite polynomials. In the context of convolution semigroups and finite free probability these results have a natural interpretation as a central limit theorem for repeated differentiation. We consider the case when these root bounds are removed and identify the potential limits of repeated differentiation as the real rooted Appell sequences. We prove that a sequence of polynomials is in the domain of attraction of an Appell sequence exactly when the empirical measures of the roots are, up to a rescaling, in the domain of attraction of a free infinitely divisible distribution naturally associated to the Appell sequence. We additionally extend these notions of infinite divisibility and fractional convolution semigroups to rectangular finite free probability. Our approach is based on the finite free R-transform of the polynomials, providing a step towards an analytic theory of finite free probability. These transforms provide a clear connection between Appell polynomials and free infinitely divisible distributions, where the finite free R-transform of a real rooted Appell polynomial is a truncated version of the R-transform of an infinitely divisible distribution.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Borel liftings in complex analysis and PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish Borel equivariant analogues of several classical theorems from complex analysis and PDE. The starting point is an equivariant Weierstrass theorem for entire functions: there exists a Borel mapping which assigns to each non-periodic positive divisor $d$ an entire function $f_d$ with divisor of zeros $\mathrm{div}(f_d)=d$ and which commutes with translation, $f_{d-w}(z)=f_d(z+w)$. We also examine the existence of equivariant Borel right inverses for the distributional Laplacian, the heat operator, and the $\bar{\partial}$-operator on the space of smooth functions. We demonstrate that Borel equivariant inverses for these maps exist on the free part of the range. In general, the freeness assumptions cannot be omitted and Borelness cannot be strengthened to continuity. Our positive results follow from a theorem establishing sufficient conditions for the existence of equivariant Borel liftings. Two key ingredients are Runge-type approximation theorems and the existence of Borel toasts, which are Borel analogues of Rokhlin towers from ergodic theory.</description>

      <title>Baily--Borel compactifications of period images and the b-semiampleness conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address two questions related to the semiampleness of line bundles arising from Hodge theory. First, we prove there is a functorial compactification of the image of a period map of a polarizable integral pure variation of Hodge structures for which the Griffiths bundle extends amply. In particular the Griffiths bundle is semiample. We prove more generally that the Hodge bundle of a Calabi--Yau variation of Hodge structures is semiample subject to some extra conditions, and as our second result deduce the b-semiampleness conjecture and the existence of a functorial Hodge-theoretic compactification of moduli spaces of polarized Calabi--Yau varieties. The semiampleness results (and the construction of the Baily--Borel compactifications) crucially use o-minimal GAGA, and the deduction of the b-semiampleness conjecture uses work of Ambro and results of Koll\'ar on the geometry of minimal lc centers to verify the extra conditions.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of smooth solutions for the LYZ equation at the critical phase $\theta =(n-2)\frac{\pi}{2}$, thereby solving the critical case of a problem posed by Collins-Jacob-Yau and Li concerning the solvability for phase $\theta \leq (n-2)\frac{\pi}{2}$. As applications, we solve the 3D Hessian equation $\sigma_2 = 1$ and the 4D Hessian quotient equation $\sigma_3 = \sigma_1$ under weaker assumptions than previously required.</description>
