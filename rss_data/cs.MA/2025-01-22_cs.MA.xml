      <title>GTDE: Grouped Training with Decentralized Execution for Multi-agent Actor-Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has given rise to diverse training paradigms to learn the policies of each agent in the multi-agent system. The paradigms of decentralized training and execution (DTDE) and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) have been proposed and widely applied. However, as the number of agents increases, the inherent limitations of these frameworks significantly degrade the performance metrics, such as win rate, total reward, etc. To reduce the influence of the increasing number of agents on the performance metrics, we propose a novel training paradigm of grouped training decentralized execution (GTDE). This framework eliminates the need for a centralized module and relies solely on local information, effectively meeting the training requirements of large-scale multi-agent systems. Specifically, we first introduce an adaptive grouping module, which divides each agent into different groups based on their observation history. To implement end-to-end training, GTDE uses Gumbel-Sigmoid for efficient point-to-point sampling on the grouping distribution while ensuring gradient backpropagation. To adapt to the uncertainty in the number of members in a group, two methods are used to implement a group information aggregation module that merges member information within the group. Empirical results show that in a cooperative environment with 495 agents, GTDE increased the total reward by an average of 382\% compared to the baseline. In a competitive environment with 64 agents, GTDE achieved a 100\% win rate against the baseline.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Search and Track of Rogue Drones using Multiagent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of intercepting rogue drones targeting sensitive critical infrastructure facilities. While current interception technologies focus mainly on the jamming/spoofing tasks, the challenges of effectively locating and tracking rogue drones have not received adequate attention. Solving this problem and integrating with recently proposed interception techniques will enable a holistic system that can reliably detect, track, and neutralize rogue drones. Specifically, this work considers a team of pursuer UAVs that can search, detect, and track multiple rogue drones over a sensitive facility. The joint search and track problem is addressed through a novel multiagent reinforcement learning scheme to optimize the agent mobility control actions that maximize the number of rogue drones detected and tracked. The performance of the proposed system is investigated under realistic settings through extensive simulation experiments with varying number of agents demonstrating both its performance and scalability.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Computation with Multiple Prioritizations in Multi-Agent Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) in large networks is computationally challenging. An approach for MAPF is prioritized planning (PP), in which agents plan sequentially according to their priority. Albeit a computationally efficient approach for MAPF, the solution quality strongly depends on the prioritization. Most prioritizations rely either on heuristics, which do not generalize well, or iterate to find adequate priorities, which costs computational effort. In this work, we show how agents can compute with multiple prioritizations simultaneously. Our approach is general as it does not rely on domain-specific knowledge. The context of this work is multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) with a receding horizon subject to computation time constraints. MAMP considers the system dynamics in more detail compared to MAPF. In numerical experiments on MAMP, we demonstrate that our approach to prioritization comes close to optimal prioritization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a minor increase in computation time. We show real-time capability in an experiment on a road network with ten vehicles in our Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab.</description>

      <title>Graph Coloring to Reduce Computation Time in Prioritized Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributing computations among agents in large networks reduces computational effort in multi-agent path finding (MAPF). One distribution strategy is prioritized planning (PP). In PP, we couple and prioritize interacting agents to achieve a desired behavior across all agents in the network. We characterize the interaction with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The computation time for solving MAPF problem using PP is mainly determined through the longest path in this DAG. The longest path depends on the fixed undirected coupling graph and the variable prioritization. The approaches from literature to prioritize agents are numerous and pursue various goals. This article presents an approach for prioritization in PP to reduce the longest path length in the coupling DAG and thus the computation time for MAPF using PP. We prove that this problem can be mapped to a graph-coloring problem, in which the number of colors required corresponds to the longest path length in the coupling DAG. We propose a decentralized graph-coloring algorithm to determine priorities for the agents. We evaluate the approach by applying it to multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on roads using, a variant of MAPF.</description>

      <title>Q-RESTORE: Quantum-Driven Framework for Resilient and Equitable Transportation Network Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and socially equitable restoration of transportation networks post disasters is crucial for community resilience and access to essential services. The ability to rapidly recover critical infrastructure can significantly mitigate the impacts of disasters, particularly in underserved communities where prolonged isolation exacerbates vulnerabilities. Traditional restoration methods prioritize functionality over computational efficiency and equity, leaving low-income communities at a disadvantage during recovery. To address this gap, this research introduces a novel framework that combines quantum computing technology with an equity-focused approach to network restoration. Optimization of road link recovery within budget constraints is achieved by leveraging D Wave's hybrid quantum solver, which targets the connectivity needs of low, average, and high income communities. This framework combines computational speed with equity, ensuring priority support for underserved populations. Findings demonstrate that this hybrid quantum solver achieves near instantaneous computation times of approximately 8.7 seconds across various budget scenarios, significantly outperforming the widely used genetic algorithm. It offers targeted restoration by first aiding low-income communities and expanding aid as budgets increase, aligning with equity goals. This work showcases quantum computing's potential in disaster recovery planning, providing a rapid and equitable solution that elevates urban resilience and social sustainability by aiding vulnerable populations in disasters.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Sum: Unlocking AI Agents Potential Through Market Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models has fundamentally transformed the capabilities of AI agents, enabling a new class of autonomous agents capable of interacting with their environment through dynamic code generation and execution. These agents possess the theoretical capacity to operate as independent economic actors within digital markets, offering unprecedented potential for value creation through their distinct advantages in operational continuity, perfect replication, and distributed learning capabilities. However, contemporary digital infrastructure, architected primarily for human interaction, presents significant barriers to their participation.
  This work presents a systematic analysis of the infrastructure requirements necessary for AI agents to function as autonomous participants in digital markets. We examine four key areas - identity and authorization, service discovery, interfaces, and payment systems - to show how existing infrastructure actively impedes agent participation. We argue that addressing these infrastructure challenges represents more than a technical imperative; it constitutes a fundamental step toward enabling new forms of economic organization. Much as traditional markets enable human intelligence to coordinate complex activities beyond individual capability, markets incorporating AI agents could dramatically enhance economic efficiency through continuous operation, perfect information sharing, and rapid adaptation to changing conditions. The infrastructure challenges identified in this work represent key barriers to realizing this potential.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted Multi-Task Federated Learning with Task Knowledge Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology has spawned a wide variety of applications, such as emergency communications, regional surveillance, and disaster relief. Due to their limited battery capacity and processing power, multiple UAVs are often required for complex tasks. In such cases, a control center is crucial for coordinating their activities, which fits well with the federated learning (FL) framework. However, conventional FL approaches often focus on a single task, ignoring the potential of training multiple related tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a UAV-assisted multi-task federated learning scheme, in which data collected by multiple UAVs can be used to train multiple related tasks concurrently. The scheme facilitates the training process by sharing feature extractors across related tasks and introduces a task attention mechanism to balance task performance and encourage knowledge sharing. To provide an analytical description of training performance, the convergence analysis of the proposed scheme is performed. Additionally, the optimal bandwidth allocation for UAVs under limited bandwidth conditions is derived to minimize communication time. Meanwhile, a UAV-EV association strategy based on coalition formation game is proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in enhancing multi-task performance and training speed.</description>

      <title>Zero-determinant strategies in repeated continuously-relaxed games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed extension has played an important role in game theory, especially in the proof of the existence of Nash equilibria in strategic form games. Mixed extension can be regarded as continuous relaxation of a strategic form game. Recently, in repeated games, a class of behavior strategies, called zero-determinant strategies, was introduced. Zero-determinant strategies unilaterally enforce linear relations between payoffs, and are used to control payoffs of players. There are many attempts to extend zero-determinant strategies so as to apply them to broader situations. Here, we extend zero-determinant strategies to repeated games where action sets of players in stage game are continuously relaxed. We see that continuous relaxation broadens the range of possible zero-determinant strategies, compared to the original repeated games. Furthermore, we introduce a special type of zero-determinant strategies, called one-point zero-determinant strategies, which repeat only one continuously-relaxed action in all rounds. By investigating several examples, we show that some property of mixed-strategy Nash equilibria can be reinterpreted as a payoff-control property of one-point zero-determinant strategies.</description>

      <title>PlotEdit: Natural Language-Driven Accessible Chart Editing in PDFs via Multimodal LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chart visualizations, while essential for data interpretation and communication, are predominantly accessible only as images in PDFs, lacking source data tables and stylistic information. To enable effective editing of charts in PDFs or digital scans, we present PlotEdit, a novel multi-agent framework for natural language-driven end-to-end chart image editing via self-reflective LLM agents. PlotEdit orchestrates five LLM agents: (1) Chart2Table for data table extraction, (2) Chart2Vision for style attribute identification, (3) Chart2Code for retrieving rendering code, (4) Instruction Decomposition Agent for parsing user requests into executable steps, and (5) Multimodal Editing Agent for implementing nuanced chart component modifications - all coordinated through multimodal feedback to maintain visual fidelity. PlotEdit outperforms existing baselines on the ChartCraft dataset across style, layout, format, and data-centric edits, enhancing accessibility for visually challenged users and improving novice productivity.</description>

      <title>Tackling Uncertainties in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning through Integration of Agent Termination Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained significant traction for solving complex real-world tasks, but the inherent stochasticity and uncertainty in these environments pose substantial challenges to efficient and robust policy learning. While Distributional Reinforcement Learning has been successfully applied in single-agent settings to address risk and uncertainty, its application in MARL is substantially limited. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates distributional learning with a safety-focused loss function to improve convergence in cooperative MARL tasks. Specifically, we introduce a Barrier Function based loss that leverages safety metrics, identified from inherent faults in the system, into the policy learning process. This additional loss term helps mitigate risks and encourages safer exploration during the early stages of training. We evaluate our method in the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark, where our approach demonstrates improved convergence and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both safety and task completion. Our results suggest that incorporating safety considerations can significantly enhance learning performance in complex, multi-agent environments.</description>

      <title>Experience-replay Innovative Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its groundbreaking success, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) still suffers from instability and nonstationarity. Replicator dynamics, the most well-known model from evolutionary game theory (EGT), provide a theoretical framework for the convergence of the trajectories to Nash equilibria and, as a result, have been used to ensure formal guarantees for MARL algorithms in stable game settings. However, they exhibit the opposite behavior in other settings, which poses the problem of finding alternatives to ensure convergence. In contrast, innovative dynamics, such as the Brown-von Neumann-Nash (BNN) or Smith, result in periodic trajectories with the potential to approximate Nash equilibria. Yet, no MARL algorithms based on these dynamics have been proposed. In response to this challenge, we develop a novel experience replay-based MARL algorithm that incorporates revision protocols as tunable hyperparameters. We demonstrate, by appropriately adjusting the revision protocols, that the behavior of our algorithm mirrors the trajectories resulting from these dynamics. Importantly, our contribution provides a framework capable of extending the theoretical guarantees of MARL algorithms beyond replicator dynamics. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with empirical results.</description>

      <title>With Great Backbones Comes Great Adversarial Transferability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) for machine vision have improved representation robustness and model performance, giving rise to pre-trained backbones like \emph{ResNet} and \emph{ViT} models tuned with SSL methods such as \emph{SimCLR}. Due to the computational and data demands of pre-training, the utilization of such backbones becomes a strenuous necessity. However, employing these backbones may inherit vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. While adversarial robustness has been studied under \emph{white-box} and \emph{black-box} settings, the robustness of models tuned on pre-trained backbones remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the role of tuning meta-information in mitigating exploitation risks is unclear. This work systematically evaluates the adversarial robustness of such models across $20,000$ combinations of tuning meta-information, including fine-tuning techniques, backbone families, datasets, and attack types. We propose using proxy models to transfer attacks, simulating varying levels of target knowledge by fine-tuning these proxies with diverse configurations. Our findings reveal that proxy-based attacks approach the effectiveness of \emph{white-box} methods, even with minimal tuning knowledge. We also introduce a naive "backbone attack," leveraging only the backbone to generate adversarial samples, which outperforms \emph{black-box} attacks and rivals \emph{white-box} methods, highlighting critical risks in model-sharing practices. Finally, our ablations reveal how increasing tuning meta-information impacts attack transferability, measuring each meta-information combination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal verification of multi-agent systems is hard, both theoretically and in practice. In particular, studies that use a single verification technique typically show limited efficiency, and allow to verify only toy examples. Here, we propose some new techniques and combine them with several recently developed ones to see what progress can be achieved for a real-life scenario. Namely, we use fixpoint approximation, domination-based strategy search, partial order reduction, and parallelization to verify heterogeneous scalable models of the Selene e-voting protocol. The experimental results show that the combination allows to verify requirements for much more sophisticated models than previously.</description>

      <title>A Quality Diversity Method to Automatically Generate Multi-Agent Path Finding Benchmark Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Quality Diversity (QD) algorithm with Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) to generate benchmark maps for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms. Previously, MAPF algorithms are tested using fixed, human-designed benchmark maps. However, such fixed benchmark maps have several problems. First, these maps may not cover all the potential failure scenarios for the algorithms. Second, when comparing different algorithms, fixed benchmark maps may introduce bias leading to unfair comparisons between algorithms. Third, since researchers test new algorithms on a small set of fixed benchmark maps, the design of the algorithms may overfit to the small set of maps. In this work, we take advantage of the QD algorithm to (1) generate maps with patterns to comprehensively understand the performance of MAPF algorithms, (2) be able to make fair comparisons between two MAPF algorithms, providing further information on the selection between two algorithms and on the design of the algorithms. Empirically, we employ this technique to generate diverse benchmark maps to evaluate and compare the behavior of different types of MAPF algorithms, including search-based, priority-based, rule-based, and learning-based algorithms. Through both single-algorithm experiments and comparisons between algorithms, we identify patterns where each algorithm excels and detect disparities in runtime or success rates between different algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bridging Swarm Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swarm intelligence (SI) explores how large groups of simple individuals (e.g., insects, fish, birds) collaborate to produce complex behaviors, exemplifying that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. A fundamental task in SI is Collective Decision-Making (CDM), where a group selects the best option among several alternatives, such as choosing an optimal foraging site. In this work, we demonstrate a theoretical and empirical equivalence between CDM and single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in multi-armed bandit problems, utilizing concepts from opinion dynamics, evolutionary game theory, and RL. This equivalence bridges the gap between SI and RL and leads us to introduce a novel abstract RL update rule called Maynard-Cross Learning. Additionally, it provides a new population-based perspective on common RL practices like learning rate adjustment and batching. Our findings enable cross-disciplinary fertilization between RL and SI, allowing techniques from one field to enhance the understanding and methodologies of the other.</description>

      <title>HIVEX: A High-Impact Environment Suite for Multi-Agent Research (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Games have been vital test beds for the rapid development of Agent-based research. Remarkable progress has been achieved in the past, but it is unclear if the findings equip for real-world problems. While pressure grows, some of the most critical ecological challenges can find mitigation and prevention solutions through technology and its applications. Most real-world domains include multi-agent scenarios and require machine-machine and human-machine collaboration. Open-source environments have not advanced and are often toy scenarios, too abstract or not suitable for multi-agent research. By mimicking real-world problems and increasing the complexity of environments, we hope to advance state-of-the-art multi-agent research and inspire researchers to work on immediate real-world problems. Here, we present HIVEX, an environment suite to benchmark multi-agent research focusing on ecological challenges. HIVEX includes the following environments: Wind Farm Control, Wildfire Resource Management, Drone-Based Reforestation, Ocean Plastic Collection, and Aerial Wildfire Suppression. We provide environments, training examples, and baselines for the main and sub-tasks. All trained models resulting from the experiments of this work are hosted on Hugging Face. We also provide a leaderboard on Hugging Face and encourage the community to submit models trained on our environment suite.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Agents using Social Choice Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that many general evaluation problems can be viewed through the lens of voting theory. Each task is interpreted as a separate voter, which requires only ordinal rankings or pairwise comparisons of agents to produce an overall evaluation. By viewing the aggregator as a social welfare function, we are able to leverage centuries of research in social choice theory to derive principled evaluation frameworks with axiomatic foundations. These evaluations are interpretable and flexible, while avoiding many of the problems currently facing cross-task evaluation. We apply this Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE) framework across multiple settings, including reinforcement learning, large language models, and humans. In practice, we observe that VasE can be more robust than popular evaluation frameworks (Elo and Nash averaging), discovers properties in the evaluation data not evident from scores alone, and can predict outcomes better than Elo in a complex seven-player game. We identify one particular approach, maximal lotteries, that satisfies important consistency properties relevant to evaluation, is computationally efficient (polynomial in the size of the evaluation data), and identifies game-theoretic cycles.</description>

      <title>Social Interpretable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) bears the promise of being a game-changer in many applications. However, since most of the literature in the field is currently focused on opaque models, the use of RL in high-stakes scenarios, where interpretability is crucial, is still limited. Recently, some approaches to interpretable RL, e.g., based on Decision Trees, have been proposed, but one of the main limitations of these techniques is their training cost. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method, called Social Interpretable RL (SIRL), that can substantially reduce the number of episodes needed for training. Our method mimics a social learning process, where each agent in a group learns to solve a given task based both on its own individual experience as well as the experience acquired together with its peers. Our approach is divided into the following two phases. (1) In the collaborative phase, all the agents in the population interact with a shared instance of the environment, where each agent observes the state and independently proposes an action. Then, voting is performed to choose the action that will actually be deployed in the environment. (2) In the individual phase, then, each agent refines its individual performance by interacting with its own instance of the environment. This mechanism makes the agents experience a larger number of episodes with little impact on the computational cost of the process. Our results (on 6 widely-known RL benchmarks) show that SIRL not only reduces the computational cost by a factor varying from a minimum of 43% to a maximum 76%, but it also increases the convergence speed and, often, improves the quality of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Concurrent-Learning Based Relative Localization in Shape Formation of Robot Swarms (Extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06052v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the shape formation problem for massive robot swarms in environments where external localization systems are unavailable. Achieving this task effectively with solely onboard measurements is still scarcely explored and faces some practical challenges. To solve this challenging problem, we propose the following novel results. Firstly, to estimate the relative positions among neighboring robots, a concurrent-learning based estimator is proposed. It relaxes the persistent excitation condition required in the classical ones such as least-square estimator. Secondly, we introduce a finite-time agreement protocol to determine the shape location. This is achieved by estimating the relative position between each robot and a randomly assigned seed robot. The initial position of the seed one marks the shape location. Thirdly, based on the theoretical results of the relative localization, a novel behavior-based control strategy is devised. This strategy not only enables adaptive shape formation of large group of robots but also enhances the observability of inter-robot relative localization. Numerical simulation results are provided to verify the performance of our proposed strategy compared to the state-of-the-art ones. Additionally, outdoor experiments on real robots further demonstrate the practical effectiveness and robustness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Eavesdropping on Goal-Oriented Communication: Timing Attacks and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communication is a new paradigm that considers the meaning of transmitted information to optimize communication. One possible application is the remote monitoring of a process under communication costs: scheduling updates based on goal-oriented considerations can significantly reduce transmission frequency while maintaining high-quality tracking performance. However, goal-oriented scheduling also opens a timing-based side-channel that an eavesdropper may exploit to obtain information about the state of the remote process, even if the content of updates is perfectly secure. In this work, we study an eavesdropping attack against pull-based goal-oriented scheduling for the tracking of remote Markov processes. We provide a theoretical framework for defining the effectiveness of the attack and of possible countermeasures, as well as a practical heuristic that can provide a balance between the performance gains offered by goal-oriented communication and the information leakage.</description>

      <title>Characterising Simulation-Based Program Equilibria</title>

Abstract: In Tennenholtz's program equilibrium, players of a game submit programs to play on their behalf. Each program receives the other programs' source code and outputs an action. This can model interactions involving AI agents, mutually transparent institutions, or commitments. Tennenholtz (2004) proves a folk theorem for program games, but the equilibria constructed are very brittle. We therefore consider simulation-based programs -- i.e., programs that work by running opponents' programs. These are relatively robust (in particular, two programs that act the same are treated the same) and are more practical than proof-based approaches. Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot is such an approach. Unfortunately, it is not generally applicable to games of three or more players, and only allows for a limited range of equilibria in two player games. In this paper, we propose a generalisation to Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot. We prove a folk theorem for our programs in a setting with access to a shared source of randomness. We then characterise their equilibria in a setting without shared randomness. Both with and without shared randomness, we achieve a much wider range of equilibria than Oesterheld's (2019) $\epsilon$Grounded$\pi$Bot. Finally, we explore the limits of simulation-based program equilibrium, showing that the Tennenholtz folk theorem cannot be attained by simulation-based programs without access to shared randomness.</description>

      <title>Strategy Masking: A Method for Guardrails in Value-based Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of reward functions to structure AI learning and decision making is core to the current reinforcement learning paradigm; however, without careful design of reward functions, agents can learn to solve problems in ways that may be considered "undesirable" or "unethical." Without thorough understanding of the incentives a reward function creates, it can be difficult to impose principled yet general control mechanisms over its behavior. In this paper, we study methods for constructing guardrails for AI agents that use reward functions to learn decision making. We introduce a novel approach, which we call strategy masking, to explicitly learn and then suppress undesirable AI agent behavior. We apply our method to study lying in AI agents and show that it can be used to effectively modify agent behavior by suppressing lying post-training without compromising agent ability to perform effectively.</description>

      <title>Solving the Unsolvable: Translating Case Law in Hong Kong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges translating case law under Hong Kong's bilingual legal system. It highlights the initial success of translating all written statutes into Chinese before the 1997 handover, a task mandated by the Basic Law. The effort involved significant collaboration among legal, linguistic, and translation experts, resulting in a comprehensive and culturally appropriate bilingual legal system. However, translating case law remains a significant challenge due to the sheer volume and continuous growth of judicial decisions. The paper critiques the governments and judiciarys sporadic and uncoordinated efforts to translate case law, contrasting it with the thorough approach previously taken for statute translation. Although the government acknowledges the importance of legal bilingualism, it lacks a sustainable strategy for translating case law. The Judiciarys position that translating all judgments is unnecessary, unrealistic, and not cost-effectiveis analyzed and critiqued for its impact on legal transparency and public trust. A proposed solution involves leveraging machine translation technology through a human-machine interactive translation platform, which undergoes two major transitions. Initially based on a neural model, the platform transitions to using a large language model for improved translation accuracy. Furthermore, it evolves from a single-agent system to a multi-agent system, incorporating Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader agents. This multi-agent approach, supported by a grant, aims to facilitate efficient, high-quality translation of judicial judgments by integrating advanced artificial intelligence and continuous feedback mechanisms, thus better meeting the needs of a bilingual legal system.</description>
