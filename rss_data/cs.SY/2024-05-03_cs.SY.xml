      <title>Kernel-based Learning for Safe Control of Discrete-Time Unknown Systems under Incomplete Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe control for dynamical systems is critical, yet the presence of unknown dynamics poses significant challenges. In this paper, we present a learning-based control approach for tracking control of a class of high-order systems, operating under the constraint of partially observable states. The uncertainties inherent within the systems are modeled by kernel ridge regression, leveraging the proposed strategic data acquisition approach with limited state measurements. To achieve accurate trajectory tracking, a state observer that seamlessly integrates with the control law is devised. The analysis of the guaranteed control performance is conducted using Lyapunov theory due to the deterministic prediction error bound of kernel ridge regression, ensuring the adaptability of the approach in safety-critical scenarios. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, numerical simulations are performed, underscoring its contributions to the advancement of control strategies.</description>

      <title>Learning to Boost the Performance of Stable Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing scale and complexity of safety-critical control systems underscore the need to evolve current control architectures aiming for the unparalleled performances achievable through state-of-the-art optimization and machine learning algorithms. However, maintaining closed-loop stability while boosting the performance of nonlinear control systems using data-driven and deep-learning approaches stands as an important unsolved challenge. In this paper, we tackle the performance-boosting problem with closed-loop stability guarantees. Specifically, we establish a synergy between the Internal Model Control (IMC) principle for nonlinear systems and state-of-the-art unconstrained optimization approaches for learning stable dynamics. Our methods enable learning over arbitrarily deep neural network classes of performance-boosting controllers for stable nonlinear systems; crucially, we guarantee Lp closed-loop stability even if optimization is halted prematurely, and even when the ground-truth dynamics are unknown, with vanishing conservatism in the class of stabilizing policies as the model uncertainty is reduced to zero. We discuss the implementation details of the proposed control schemes, including distributed ones, along with the corresponding optimization procedures, demonstrating the potential of freely shaping the cost functions through several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Zonotope-based Symbolic Controller Synthesis for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the controller synthesis problem for nonlinear control systems under linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications using zonotope techniques. A local-to-global control strategy is proposed for the desired specification expressed as an LTL formula. First, a novel approach is developed to divide the state space into finite zonotopes and constrained zonotopes, which are called cells and allowed to intersect with the neighbor cells. Second, from the intersection relation, a graph among all cells is generated to verify the realization of the accepting path for the LTL formula. The realization verification determines if there is a need for the control design, and also results in finite local LTL formulas. Third, once the accepting path is realized, a novel abstraction-based method is derived for the controller design. In particular, we only focus on the cells from the realization verification and approximate each cell thanks to properties of zonotopes. Based on local symbolic models and local LTL formulas, an iterative synthesis algorithm is proposed to design all local abstract controllers, whose existence and combination establish the global controller for the LTL formula. Finally, the proposed framework is illustrated via a path planning problem of mobile robots.</description>

      <title>Active Cell Balancing for Extended Operational Time of Lithium-Ion Battery Systems in Energy Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell inconsistency within a lithium-ion battery system poses a significant challenge in maximizing the system operational time. This study presents an optimization-driven active balancing method to minimize the effects of cell inconsistency on the system operational time while simultaneously satisfying the system output power demand and prolonging the system operational time in energy storage applications. The proposed method utilizes a fractional order model to forecast the terminal voltage dynamics of each cell within a battery system, enhanced with a particle-swarm-optimisation-genetic algorithm for precise parameter identification. It is implemented under two distinct cell-level balancing topologies: independent cell balancing and differential cell balancing. Subsequently, the current distribution for each topology is determined by resolving two optimization control problems constrained by the battery's operational specifications and power demands. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by extensive experiments based on the two balancing topologies. The results demonstrate that the proposed method increases the operational time by 3.2%.</description>

      <title>Rare Collision Risk Estimation of Autonomous Vehicles with Multi-Agent Situation Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a formal framework for the rare collision risk estimation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with multi-agent situation awareness, affected by different sources of noise in a complex dynamic environment. In our proposed setting, the situation awareness is considered for one of the ego vehicles by aggregating a range of diverse information gathered from other vehicles into a vector. We model AVs equipped with the situation awareness as general stochastic hybrid systems (GSHS) and assess the probability of collision in a lane-change scenario where two self-driving vehicles simultaneously intend to switch lanes into a shared one, while utilizing the time-to-collision measure for decision-making as required. Due to the substantial data requirements of simulation-based methods for the rare collision risk estimation, we leverage a multi-level importance splitting technique, known as interacting particle system-based estimation with fixed assignment splitting (IPS-FAS). This approach allows us to estimate the probability of a rare event by employing a group of interacting particles. Specifically, each particle embodies a system trajectory and engages with others through resampling and branching, focusing computational resources on trajectories with the highest probability of encountering the rare event. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated through an extensive simulation of a lane-change scenario.</description>

      <title>Non-overshooting sliding mode for UAV control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of uncertain systems, a non-overshooting sliding mode control is presented to make them globally exponentially stable and without overshoot. Even when the unknown stochastic disturbance exists, and the time-variant reference trajectory is required, the strict non-overshooting stabilization is still achieved. The control law design is based on a desired second-order sliding mode (2-sliding mode), which successively includes two bounded-gain subsystems. Non-overshooting stability requires that the system gains depend on the initial values of system variables. In order to obtain the global non-overshooting stability, the first subsystem with non-overshooting reachability compresses the initial values of the second subsystem to a given bounded range. By partitioning these initial values, the bounded system gains are determined to satisfy the robust non-overshooting stability. In order to reject the chattering in the controller output, a tanh-function-based sliding mode is developed for the design of smoothed non-overshooting controller. The proposed method is applied to a UAV trajectory tracking when the disturbances and uncertainties exist. The control laws are designed to implement the non-overshooting stabilization in position and attitude. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the flying tests.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Sensitivity Identification for Cross-Directional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At Diamond Light Source, the UK's national synchrotron facility, electron beam disturbances are attenuated by the fast orbit feedback (FOFB), which controls a cross-directional (CD) system with hundreds of inputs and outputs. Due to the inability to measure the disturbance spectrum in real-time, the closed-loop sensitivity of the FOFB cannot be evaluated, making it difficult to compare FOFB algorithms and detect faults. Existing methods rely on comparing open-loop with closed-loop measurements, but they are prone to instabilities and actuator saturation because of the system's strong directionality. Here, we introduce a reference signal to estimate the complementary sensitivity in closed loop. By decoupling the system into sets of single-input, single-output (SISO) systems, we design the reference mode-by-mode to accommodate the system's strong directionality. This allows SISO system identification to be used, making our approach suitable for large-scale systems. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on reference amplitudes to achieve a predefined estimation error bound in the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. Our approach not only enables performance estimation of ill-conditioned CD systems in closed-loop but also provides a signal for fault detection. Its potential applications extend to other CD systems, such as papermaking, steel rolling, or battery manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Satellite Network Infrastructure: A Joint Approach to Gateway Placement and Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite constellation systems are becoming more attractive to provide communication services worldwide, especially in areas without network connectivity. While optimizing satellite gateway placement is crucial for operators to minimize deployment and operating costs, reducing the number of gateways may require more inter-satellite link hops to reach the ground network, thereby increasing latency. Therefore, it is of significant importance to develop a framework that optimizes gateway placement, dynamic routing, and flow management in inter-satellite links to enhance network performance. To this end, we model an optimization problem as a mixed-integer problem with a cost function combining the number of gateways, flow allocation, and traffic latency, allowing satellite operators to set priorities based on their policies. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach effectively reduces the number of active gateways by selecting their most appropriate locations while balancing the trade-off between the number of gateways and traffic latency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of different weights in the cost function on performance through comparative analysis.</description>

      <title>Learning-to-solve unit commitment based on few-shot physics-guided spatial-temporal graph convolution network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a few-shot physics-guided spatial temporal graph convolutional network (FPG-STGCN) to fast solve unit commitment (UC). Firstly, STGCN is tailored to parameterize UC. Then, few-shot physics-guided learning scheme is proposed. It exploits few typical UC solutions yielded via commercial optimizer to escape from local minimum, and leverages the augmented Lagrangian method for constraint satisfaction. To further enable both feasibility and continuous relaxation for integers in learning process, straight-through estimator for Tanh-Sign composition is proposed to fully differentiate the mixed integer solution space. Case study on the IEEE benchmark justifies that, our method bests mainstream learning ways on UC feasibility, and surpasses traditional solver on efficiency.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Landing of Reusable Launch Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a landing guidance strategy for reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) using a model predictive approach based on sequential convex programming (SCP). The proposed approach devises two distinct optimal control problems (OCPs): planning a fuel-optimal landing trajectory that accommodates practical path constraints specific to RLVs, and determining real-time optimal tracking commands. This dual optimization strategy allows for reduced computational load through adjustable prediction horizon lengths in the tracking task, achieving near closed-loop performance. Enhancements in model fidelity for the tracking task are achieved through an alternative rotational dynamics representation, enabling a more stable numerical solution of the OCP and accounting for vehicle transient dynamics. Furthermore, modifications of aerodynamic force in both planning and tracking phases are proposed, tailored for thrust-vector-controlled RLVs, to reduce the fidelity gap without adding computational complexity. Extensive 6-DOF simulation experiments validate the effectiveness and improved guidance performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/hslyu/dbspf.</description>

      <title>Market Power and Withholding Behavior of Energy Storage Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electricity markets are experiencing a rapid increase in energy storage unit participation. Unlike conventional generation resources, quantifying the competitive operation and identifying if a storage unit is exercising market power is challenging, particularly in the context of multi-interval bidding strategies. We present a framework to differentiate strategic capacity withholding behaviors attributed to market power from inherent competitive bidding in storage unit strategies. Our framework evaluates the profitability of strategic storage unit participation, analyzing bidding behaviors as both price takers and price makers using a self-scheduling model, and investigates how they leverage market inefficiencies. Specifically, we propose a price sensitivity model derived from the linear supply function equilibrium model to examine the price-anticipating bidding strategy, effectively capturing the influence of market power. We introduce a sufficient ex-post analysis for market operators to identify potential exploitative behaviors by monitoring instances of withholding within the bidding profiles, ensuring market resilience and competitiveness. We discuss and verify applicability of the proposed framework to realistic settings. Our analysis substantiates commonly observed economic bidding behaviors of storage units. Furthermore, it demonstrates that significant price volatility offers considerable profit opportunities not only for participants possessing market power but also for typical strategic profit seekers.</description>

      <title>Delay and Overhead Efficient Transmission Scheduling for Federated Learning in UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the wireless scheduling design to coordinate the transmissions of (local) model parameters of federated learning (FL) for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The overall goal of the proposed design is to realize the FL training and aggregation processes with a central aggregator exploiting the sensory data collected by the UAVs but it considers the multi-hop wireless network formed by the UAVs. Such transmissions of model parameters over the UAV-based wireless network potentially cause large transmission delays and overhead. Our proposed framework smartly aggregates local model parameters trained by the UAVs while efficiently transmitting the underlying parameters to the central aggregator in each FL global round. We theoretically show that the proposed scheme achieves minimal delay and communication overhead. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Efficacy of the Use of Inertial Measurement and Global Positioning System Data to Reverse Engineer Automotive CAN Bus Steering Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle control is growing in availability for new vehicles and there is a potential need to retrofit older vehicles with this capability. Additionally, automotive cybersecurity has become a significant concern in recent years due to documented attacks on vehicles. As a result, researchers have been exploring reverse engineering techniques to automate vehicle control and improve vehicle security and threat analysis. In prior work, a vehicle's accelerator and brake pedal controller area network (CAN) channels were identified using reverse engineering techniques without prior knowledge of the vehicle. However, the correlation results for deceleration were lower than those for acceleration, which may be able to be improved by incorporating data from an additional telemetry device. In this paper, a method that uses IMU and GPS data to reverse-engineer a vehicle's steering wheel position CAN channels, without prior knowledge of the vehicle, is presented. Using GPS data is shown to greatly improve correlation values for deceleration, particularly for the brake pedal CAN channels. This work demonstrates the efficacy of using these data sources for automotive CAN reverse engineering. This has potential uses in automotive vehicle control and for improving vehicle security and threat analysis.</description>

      <title>A Convex Formulation of the Soft-Capture Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fast trajectory optimization algorithm for the soft capture of uncooperative tumbling space objects. Our algorithm generates safe, dynamically feasible, and minimum-fuel trajectories for a six-degree-of-freedom servicing spacecraft to achieve soft capture (near-zero relative velocity at contact) between predefined locations on the servicer spacecraft and target body. We solve a convex problem by enforcing a convex relaxation of the field-of-view constraint, followed by a sequential convex program correcting the trajectory for collision avoidance. The optimization problems can be solved with a standard second-order cone programming solver, making the algorithm both fast and practical for implementation in flight software. We demonstrate the performance and robustness of our algorithm in simulation over a range of object tumble rates up to 10{\deg}/s.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Dynamic Modeling Approach to Integrated Motion Planning and Actuator Physical Design for Mobile Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the differentiable dynamic modeling of mobile manipulators to facilitate efficient motion planning and physical design of actuators, where the actuator design is parameterized by physically meaningful motor geometry parameters. These parameters impact the manipulator's link mass, inertia, center-of-mass, torque constraints, and angular velocity constraints, influencing control authority in motion planning and trajectory tracking control. A motor's maximum torque/speed and how the design parameters affect the dynamics are modeled analytically, facilitating differentiable and analytical dynamic modeling. Additionally, an integrated locomotion and manipulation planning problem is formulated with direct collocation discretization, using the proposed differentiable dynamics and motor parameterization. Such dynamics are required to capture the dynamic coupling between the base and the manipulator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of differentiable dynamics in speeding up optimization and advantages in task completion time and energy consumption over established sequential motion planning approach. Finally, this paper introduces a simultaneous actuator design and motion planning framework, providing numerical results to validate the proposed differentiable modeling approach for co-design problems.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of infinite-dimensional systems under quantization and packet loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of stabilizing infinite-dimensional systems with input and output quantization. The closed-loop system we consider is subject to packet loss in the sensor-to-controller channels, whose duration is assumed to be averagely bounded. Given a bound on the initial state, we propose design methods for dynamic quantizers with zoom parameters. We show that the closed-loop state staring in a given region exponentially converges to zero if the bounds of quantization errors and packet-loss duration satisfy suitable conditions. Since the norms of the operators representing the system dynamics are used in the proposed quantization schemes, we also present methods for approximately computing the operator norms.</description>

      <title>Co-Optimization of EV Charging Control and Incentivization for Enhanced Power System Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how high charging rate demands from electric vehicles (EVs) in a power distribution grid may collectively cause its dynamic instability, and, accordingly, how a price incentivization strategy can be used to steer customers to settle for lesser charging rate demands so that these instabilities can be avoided. We pose the problem as a joint optimization and optimal control formulation. The optimization determines the optimal charging setpoints for EVs to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm of the transfer function of the grid model, while the optimal control simultaneously develops a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based state-feedback control signal for the battery-currents of those EVs to jointly minimize the risk of grid instability. A subsequent algorithm is developed to determine how much customers may be willing to sacrifice their intended charging rate demands in return for financial incentives. Results are derived for both unidirectional and bidirectional charging, and validated using numerical simulations of multiple EV charging stations in the IEEE 33-bus power distribution model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce Generative Manufacturing Systems (GMS) as a novel approach to effectively manage and coordinate autonomous manufacturing assets, thereby enhancing their responsiveness and flexibility to address a wide array of production objectives and human preferences. Deviating from traditional explicit modeling, GMS employs generative AI, including diffusion models and ChatGPT, for implicit learning from envisioned futures, marking a shift from a model-optimum to a training-sampling decision-making. Through the integration of generative AI, GMS enables complex decision-making through interactive dialogue with humans, allowing manufacturing assets to generate multiple high-quality global decisions that can be iteratively refined based on human feedback. Empirical findings showcase GMS's substantial improvement in system resilience and responsiveness to uncertainties, with decision times reduced from seconds to milliseconds. The study underscores the inherent creativity and diversity in the generated solutions, facilitating human-centric decision-making through seamless and continuous human-machine interactions.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Multi-Application Packet Scheduling for Application-Specific QoE Enhancement Based on Knowledge-Embedded DDPG in 6G RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapidly growing diversity of concurrent applications from both different users and same devices calls for application-specific Quality of Experience (QoE) enhancement of future wireless communications. Achieving this goal relies on application-specific packet scheduling, as it is vital for achieving tailored QoE enhancement by realizing the application-specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and for optimal perceived QoE values. However, the intertwining diversified QoE perception mechanisms, fairness among concurrent applications, and the impact of network dynamics inevitably complicate tailored packet scheduling. To achieve concurrent application-specific QoE enhancement, the problem of multi-user multi-application packet scheduling in downlink 6G radio access network (RAN) is first formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem in this paper. For solving this problem, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based solution is proposed. However, due to the high dimensionalities of both the state and action spaces, the trained DDPG agents might generate decisions causing unnecessary resource waste. Hence, a knowledge embedding method is proposed to adjust the decisions of the DDPG agents according to human insights. Extensive experiments are conducted, which demonstrate the superiority of DDPG-based packet schedulers over baseline algorithms and the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge embedding technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex and unknown processes, global models are initially generated over the entire experimental space, but they often fail to provide accurate predictions in local areas. Recognizing this limitation, this study addresses the need for models that effectively represent both global and local experimental spaces. It introduces a novel machine learning (ML) approach: Polynomial Chaos Expanded Gaussian Process (PCEGP), leveraging polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to calculate input-dependent hyperparameters of the Gaussian process (GP). This approach provides a mathematically interpretable method that incorporates non-stationary covariance functions and heteroscedastic noise estimation to generate locally adapted models. The model performance is compared to different algorithms in benchmark tests for regression tasks. The results demonstrate low prediction errors of the PCEGP in these benchmark applications, highlighting model performance that is often competitive with or superior to previous methods. A key advantage of the presented model is the transparency and traceability in the calculation of hyperparameters and model predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a wireless network with multiple single-antenna repeaters that amplify and instantaneously re-transmit the signals they receive to improve the channel rank and system coverage. Due to the positive feedback formed by inter-repeater interference, stability could become a critical issue. We investigate the problem of determining the maximum amplification gain that the repeaters can use without breaking the system stability. Specifically, we obtain a bound by using the Gershgorin disc theorem, which reveals that the maximum amplification gain is restricted by the sum of channel amplitude gains. We show by case studies the usefulness of the so-obtained bound and provide insights on how the repeaters should be deployed.</description>

      <title>CoViS-Net: A Cooperative Visual Spatial Foundation Model for Multi-Robot Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial understanding from vision is crucial for robots operating in unstructured environments. In the real world, spatial understanding is often an ill-posed problem. There are a number of powerful classical methods that accurately regress relative pose, however, these approaches often lack the ability to leverage data-derived priors to resolve ambiguities. In multi-robot systems, these challenges are exacerbated by the need for accurate and frequent position estimates of cooperating agents. To this end, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot, visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data. Unlike prior work evaluated primarily on offline datasets, we design our model specifically for online evaluation and real-world deployment on cooperative robots. Our model is completely decentralized, platform agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing network infrastructure. In this work, we focus on relative pose estimation and local Bird's Eye View (BEV) prediction tasks. Unlike classical approaches, we show that our model can accurately predict relative poses without requiring camera overlap, and predict BEVs of regions not visible to the ego-agent. We demonstrate our model on a multi-robot formation control task outside the confines of the laboratory.</description>

      <title>A New Self-Alignment Method without Solving Wahba Problem for SINS in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initial alignment is one of the key technologies in strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) to provide initial state information for vehicle attitude and navigation. For some situations, such as the attitude heading reference system, the position is not necessarily required or even available, then the self-alignment that does not rely on any external aid becomes very necessary. This study presents a new self-alignment method under swaying conditions, which can determine the latitude and attitude simultaneously by utilizing all observation vectors without solving the Wahba problem, and it is different from the existing methods. By constructing the dyadic tensor of each observation and reference vector itself, all equations related to observation and reference vectors are accumulated into one equation, where the latitude variable is extracted and solved according to the same eigenvalues of similar matrices on both sides of the equation, meanwhile the attitude is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition. Simulation and experiment tests verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and the alignment result is better than TRIAD in convergence speed and stability and comparable with OBA method in alignment accuracy with or without latitude. It is useful for guiding the design of initial alignment in autonomous vehicle applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Worldwide Cross-cultural Differences in Implicit Driving Cues: Review, Comparative Analysis, and Research Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing and understanding implicit driving cues across diverse cultures is imperative for fostering safe and efficient global transportation systems, particularly when training new immigrants holding driving licenses from culturally disparate countries. Additionally, it is essential to consider cross-cultural differences in the development of Automated Driving features tailored to different countries. Previous piloting studies have compared and analyzed cross-cultural differences in selected implicit driving cues, but they typically examine only limited countries. However, a comprehensive worldwide comparison and analysis are lacking. This study conducts a thorough review of existing literature, online blogs, and expert insights from diverse countries to investigate cross-cultural disparities in driving behaviors, specifically focusing on implicit cues such as non-verbal communication (e.g., hand gestures, signal lighting, honking), norms, and social expectations. Through comparative analysis, variations in driving cues are illuminated across different cultural contexts. Based on the findings and identified gaps, a research roadmap is proposed for future research to further explore and address these differences, aiming to enhance intercultural communication, improve road safety, and increase transportation efficiency on a global scale. This paper presents the pioneering work towards a comprehensive understanding of the implicit driving cues across cultures. Moreover, this understanding will inform the development of automated driving systems tailored to different countries considering cross-cultural differences.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz constant estimation for general neural network architectures using control tools</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the estimation of the Lipschitz constant of neural networks using semidefinite programming. For this purpose, we interpret neural networks as time-varying dynamical systems, where the $k$-th layer corresponds to the dynamics at time $k$. A key novelty with respect to prior work is that we use this interpretation to exploit the series interconnection structure of neural networks with a dynamic programming recursion. Nonlinearities, such as activation functions and nonlinear pooling layers, are handled with integral quadratic constraints. If the neural network contains signal processing layers (convolutional or state space model layers), we realize them as 1-D/2-D/N-D systems and exploit this structure as well. We distinguish ourselves from related work on Lipschitz constant estimation by more extensive structure exploitation (scalability) and a generalization to a large class of common neural network architectures. To show the versatility and computational advantages of our method, we apply it to different neural network architectures trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Modeling pedestrian fundamental diagram based on Directional Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding pedestrian dynamics is crucial for appropriately designing pedestrian spaces. The pedestrian fundamental diagram (FD), which describes the relationship between pedestrian flow and density within a given space, characterizes these dynamics. Pedestrian FDs are significantly influenced by the flow type, such as uni-directional, bi-directional, and crossing flows. However, to the authors' knowledge, generalized pedestrian FDs that are applicable to various flow types have not been proposed. This may be due to the difficulty of using statistical methods to characterize the flow types. The flow types significantly depend on the angles of pedestrian movement; however, these angles cannot be processed by standard statistics due to their periodicity. In this study, we propose a comprehensive model for pedestrian FDs that can describe the pedestrian dynamics for various flow types by applying Directional Statistics. First, we develop a novel statistic describing the pedestrian flow type solely from pedestrian trajectory data using Directional Statistics. Then, we formulate a comprehensive pedestrian FD model that can be applied to various flow types by incorporating the proposed statistics into a traditional pedestrian FD model. The proposed model was validated using actual pedestrian trajectory data. The results confirmed that the model effectively represents the essential nature of pedestrian dynamics, such as the capacity reduction due to conflict of crossing flows and the capacity improvement due to the lane formation in bi-directional flows.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a setting where heterogeneous agents with connectivity are performing inference using unlabeled streaming data. Observed data are only partially informative about the target variable of interest. In order to overcome the uncertainty, agents cooperate with each other by exchanging their local inferences with and through a fusion center. To evaluate how each agent influences the overall decision, we adopt a causal framework in order to distinguish the actual influence of agents from mere correlations within the decision-making process. Various scenarios reflecting different agent participation patterns and fusion center policies are investigated. We derive expressions to quantify the causal impact of each agent on the joint decision, which could be beneficial for anticipating and addressing atypical scenarios, such as adversarial attacks or system malfunctions. We validate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and a real-world application of multi-camera crowd counting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the design of data-driven predictive controllers for nonlinear systems from input-output data via linear-in-control input Koopman lifted models. Instead of identifying and simulating a Koopman model to predict future outputs, we design a subspace predictive controller in the Koopman space. This allows us to learn the observables minimizing the multi-step output prediction error of the Koopman subspace predictor, preventing the propagation of prediction errors. To avoid losing feasibility of our predictive control scheme due to prediction errors, we compute a terminal cost and terminal set in the Koopman space and we obtain recursive feasibility guarantees through an interpolated initial state. As a third contribution, we introduce a novel regularization cost yielding input-to-state stability guarantees with respect to the prediction error for the resulting closed-loop system. The performance of the developed Koopman data-driven predictive control methodology is illustrated on a nonlinear benchmark example from the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling contact forces during interactions is critical for locomotion and manipulation tasks. While sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) has succeeded in many contact-rich problems, current RL methods achieve forceful interactions implicitly without explicitly regulating forces. We propose a method for training RL policies for direct force control without requiring access to force sensing. We showcase our method on a whole-body control platform of a quadruped robot with an arm. Such force control enables us to perform gravity compensation and impedance control, unlocking compliant whole-body manipulation. The learned whole-body controller with variable compliance makes it intuitive for humans to teleoperate the robot by only commanding the manipulator, and the robot's body adjusts automatically to achieve the desired position and force. Consequently, a human teleoperator can easily demonstrate a wide variety of loco-manipulation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first deployment of learned whole-body force control in legged manipulators, paving the way for more versatile and adaptable legged robots.</description>

Abstract: Feedback-evolving games is a framework that models the co-evolution between payoff functions and an environmental state. It serves as a useful tool to analyze many social dilemmas such as natural resource consumption, behaviors in epidemics, and the evolution of biological populations. However, it has primarily focused on the dynamics of a single population of agents. In this paper, we consider the impact of two populations of agents that share a common environmental resource. We focus on a scenario where individuals in one population are governed by an environmentally "responsible" incentive policy, and individuals in the other population are environmentally "irresponsible". An analysis on the asymptotic stability of the coupled system is provided, and conditions for which the resource collapses are identified. We then derive consumption rates for the irresponsible population that optimally exploit the environmental resource, and analyze how incentives should be allocated to the responsible population that most effectively promote the environment via a sensitivity analysis.</description>

Abstract: Quantum parameter estimation theory is an important component of quantum information theory and provides the statistical foundation that underpins important topics such as quantum system identification and quantum waveform estimation. When there is more than one parameter the ultimate precision in the mean square error given by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound is not necessarily achievable. For non-full rank quantum states, it was not known when this bound can be saturated (achieved) when only a single copy of the quantum state encoding the unknown parameters is available. This single-copy scenario is important because of its experimental/practical tractability. Recently, necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound in the multiparameter single-copy scenario have been established in terms of i) the commutativity of a set of projected symmetric logarithmic derivatives and ii) the existence of a unitary solution to a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. New sufficient conditions were also obtained that only depend on properties of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives. In this paper, key structural properties of optimal measurements that saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound are illuminated. These properties are exploited to i) show that the sufficient conditions are in fact necessary and sufficient for an optimal measurement to be projective, ii) give an alternative proof of previously established necessary conditions, and iii) describe general POVMs, not necessarily projective, that saturate the multiparameter QCRB. Examples are given where a unitary solution to the system of nonlinear partial differential equations can be explicitly calculated when the required conditions are fulfilled.</description>

      <title>Evaluation and Optimization of Adaptive Cruise Control in Autonomous Vehicles using the CARLA Simulator: A Study on Performance under Wet and Dry Weather Conditions</title>

Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control ACC can change the speed of the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from the following vehicle automatically. The primary purpose of this research is to use cutting-edge computing approaches to locate and track vehicles in real time under various conditions to achieve a safe ACC. The paper examines the extension of ACC employing depth cameras and radar sensors within Autonomous Vehicles AVs to respond in real time by changing weather conditions using the Car Learning to Act CARLA simulation platform at noon. The ego vehicle controller's decision to accelerate or decelerate depends on the speed of the leading ahead vehicle and the safe distance from that vehicle. Simulation results show that a Proportional Integral Derivative PID control of autonomous vehicles using a depth camera and radar sensors reduces the speed of the leading vehicle and the ego vehicle when it rains. In addition, longer travel time was observed for both vehicles in rainy conditions than in dry conditions. Also, PID control prevents the leading vehicle from rear collisions</description>

Abstract: Designing distributed algorithms for multi-agent problems is vital for many emerging application domains, and game-theoretic approaches are emerging as a useful paradigm to design such algorithms. However, much of the emphasis of the game-theoretic approach is on the study of equilibrium behavior, whereas transient behavior is often less explored. Therefore, in this paper we study the transient efficiency guarantees of best response processes in the context of resource-allocation games, which are used to model a variety of engineering applications. Specifically, the main focus of the paper is on designing utility functions of agents to induce optimal short-term system-level behavior under a best-response process. Interestingly, the resulting transient performance guarantees are relatively close to the optimal asymptotic performance guarantees. Furthermore, we characterize a trade-off that results when optimizing for both asymptotic and transient efficiency through various utility designs.</description>

      <title>Motor State Prediction and Friction Compensation for Brushless DC Motor Drives Using Data-Driven Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16533v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to provide robust, reliable, and accurate position and velocity control of motor drives, friction compensation has emerged as a key difficulty. Non-characterised friction could give rise to large position errors and vibrations which could be intensified by stick-slip motion and limit cycles. This paper presents an application of two data-driven nonlinear model identification techniques to discover the governing equations of motor dynamics that also characterise friction. Namely, the extraction of low-power data from time-delayed coordinates of motor velocity and sparse regression on nonlinear terms was applied to data acquired from a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor, to identify the underlying dynamics. The latter can be considered an extension of the conventional linear motor model commonly used in many model-based controllers. The identified nonlinear model was then contrasted with a nonlinear model that included the LuGre friction model and a linear model without friction. A nonlinear grey box model estimation method was used to calculate the optimum friction parameters for the LuGre model. The resulting nonlinear motor model with friction characteristics was then validated using a feedback friction compensation algorithm. The novel model showed more than 90% accuracy in predicting the motor states in all considered input excitation signals. In addition, the model-based friction compensation scheme showed a relative increase in performance when compared with a system without friction compensation.</description>

Abstract: Cybersecurity in building energy management is crucial for protecting infrastructure, ensuring data integrity, and preventing unauthorized access or manipulation. This paper investigates the energy efficiency and cybersecurity of building energy management systems (BMS) against false data injection (FDI) attacks using proportional-integral (PI) and model predictive control (MPC) methods. Focusing on a commercial building model with five rooms, vulnerability of PI-based BMS and nonlinear MPC-based BMS against FDIs on sensors and actuators is studied. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of these control strategies in maintaining system performance and lifespan, highlighting the potential of MPC in enhancing system resilience against cyber threats. Our case studies demonstrate that even a short term FDIA can cause a 12% reduction in lifetime of a heat-pump under an MPC controller, and cause a near thirty-fold overuse of flow valves under a PI controller.</description>

      <title>Voltage Restoration in MVDC Shipboard Microgrids with Economic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future Naval Microgrids (MGs) will include hybrid energy storage systems (ESS), including battery and supercapacitors to respond to emerging constant power loads (CPLs) and fluctuating pulsed power loads (PPLs). Voltage regulation of naval microgrids and power sharing among these resources become critical for success of a mission. This paper presents a novel control strategy using nonlinear model predictive controller embedded with a complex droop control architecture for voltage restoration and power sharing in medium voltage DC (MVDC) Naval MGs. The complex droop control ensures allocating supercapacitors (SCs) for high-frequency loads (i.e., PPLs), while battery energy storage system (BESS) and auxiliary generators share the steady-state load (i.e., CPL). Compared to state-of-the-art control of the naval ship MGs that relies on linear models, the proposed method incorporates the nonlinear behavior of the MGs in the closed-loop control framework via nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). A reduced order representation of the MVDC dynamic is employed as the prediction model, augmented with a multi-objective, constraints-based, optimal control formulation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control framework for voltage restoration and power sharing of resources in naval MGs.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel control strategy for medium voltage DC (MVDC) naval shipboard microgrids (MGs), employing a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) enhanced with stabilizing features and an intricate droop control architecture. This combination quickly regulates the output voltage and adeptly allocates supercapacitors for pulsed power loads (PPLs), while the battery energy storage system (BESS) and auxiliary generators handle the steady state loads. A key feature of this study is the formulation of terminal cost and constraints, providing recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability in the Lyapunov sense, that offers a more robust and effective approach to naval power and energy management. By comparing the proposed Lyapunov-based NMPC with conventional PI controller under fluctuating PPLs, the control robustness is validated.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Operational Metrics for Real-time Resilience Assessment in DC Microgrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resilience is emerging as an evolving notion, reflecting a system's ability to endure and adapt to sudden and catastrophic changes and disruptions. This paper spotlights the significance of the quantitative resilience indices of medium-voltage DC (MVDC) distribution technology in marine vessels, notably naval ships. Given the intricate electrical requirements of modern naval ships, the need for a robust power supply underlines the imperative of resilient DC microgrids. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel quantitative metric for operational resilience of DC microgrids based on the measured voltage of main DC bus. This metric not only fuses real-time tracking, compatibility, and computational efficiency, but also adeptly monitors multiple event phases based on time-domain analysis of dc bus voltage dynamics. The intricacies of the dc bus voltage, including overshoots and undershoots, are meticulously accounted for in the algorithm design. With respect to existing research that typically focuses on offline resilience assessments, the proposed index provides valuable real-time information for microgrid operators and identifies whether microgrid resilience is deteriorating over time.</description>

      <title>Learning the Dynamics of Future Marine Microgrids Using Temporal Convolutional Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medium-voltage direct-current (MVDC) ship-board microgrids (SMGs) are the state-of-the-art architecture for onboard power distribution in navy. These systems are considered to be highly dynamic due to high penetration of power electronic converters and volatile load patterns such as pulsed-power load (PPL) and propulsion motors demand variation. Obtaining the dynamic model of an MVDC SMG is a challenging task due to the confidentiality of system components models and uncertainty in the dynamic models through time. In this paper, a dynamic identification framework based on a temporal convolutional neural network (TCN) is developed to learn the system dynamics from measurement data. Different kinds of testing scenarios are implemented, and the testing results show that this approach achieves an exceptional performance and high generalization ability, thus holding substantial promise for development of advanced data-driven control strategies and stability prediction of the system.</description>

      <title>Coordination of Damping Controllers: A Novel Data-Informed Approach for Adaptability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the novel concept of damping controller coordination, which aims to minimize the Total Action metric by identifying an optimal switching combination (on/off) of these controllers. The metric is rooted in power system physics, capturing oscillation energy associated with all synchronous generators in the grid. While coordination has shown promising results, it has relied on computing linear sensitivities based on the grid model. This paper proposes a data-informed framework to accurately estimate total action and subsequently determine an optimal switching combination. The estimation is provided by a multivariate function approximator that captures the nonlinear relationship between system-wide area measurements, the status of damping controllers, and the conditions of the disturbance. By enabling real-time coordination, electromechanical oscillations are reduced, enhancing power system stability. The concept is tested in the Western North America Power System (wNAPS) and compared with the model-based approach for coordination. The proposed coordination outperforms the model-based approach, demonstrating effective adaptability and performance in handling multi-mode events. Additionally, the results show significant reductions in low-frequency electromechanical oscillations even under various operating conditions, fault locations, and time delay considerations.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed controller synthesis framework for safe navigation of multi-agent systems. We leverage control barrier functions to formulate collision avoidance with obstacles and teammates as constraints on the control input for a state-dependent network optimization problem that encodes team formation and the navigation task. Our algorithmic solution is valid for general nonlinear control dynamics and optimization problems. The resulting controller is distributed, satisfies the safety constraints at all times, and is asymptotically optimal. We illustrate its performance in a team of differential-drive robots in a variety of complex environments, both in simulation and in hardware.</description>

Abstract: This paper delves into a rendezvous scenario involving a chaser and a target spacecraft, focusing on the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to design a controller capable of guiding the chaser toward the target. The operational principle of spacecraft thrusters, requiring a minimum activation time that leads to the existence of a control deadband, introduces mixed-integer constraints into the optimization, posing a considerable computational challenge due to the exponential complexity on the number of integer constraints. We address this complexity by presenting two solver algorithms that efficiently approximate the optimal solution in significantly less time than standard solvers, making them well-suited for real-time applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variability of renewable energy generation and the unpredictability of electricity demand create a need for real-time economic dispatch (ED) of assets in microgrids. However, solving numerical optimization problems in real-time can be incredibly challenging. This study proposes using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning to address these challenges. Compared to traditional methods, CNN is more efficient, delivers more dependable results, and has a shorter response time when dealing with uncertainties. While CNN has shown promising results, it does not extract explainable knowledge from the data. To address this limitation, a physics-inspired CNN model is developed by incorporating constraints of the ED problem into the CNN training to ensure that the model follows physical laws while fitting the data. The proposed method can significantly accelerate real-time economic dispatch of microgrids without compromising the accuracy of numerical optimization techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed data-driven approach for optimal allocation of microgrid resources in real-time is verified through a comprehensive comparison with conventional numerical optimization approaches.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to introduce a new statistical learning technique based on sparsity promoting for data-driven modeling and control of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Compared with conventional sparse regression techniques that might introduce computational complexities when the number of candidate functions increases, an innovative algorithm, named adaptive regulated sparse regression (ARSR) is proposed that adaptively regulates the hyperparameter weights of candidate functions to best represent the dynamics of PV systems. Utilizing this algorithm, open-loop and closed-loop models of single-stage and two-stage PV systems are obtained from measurements and are utilized for control design purposes. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed data-driven approach can successfully be employed for fault analysis studies, which distinguishes its capabilities compared with other data-driven techniques. Finally, the proposed approach is validated through real-time simulations.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Minimization using Multi-agent UAVs based on AI-Enhanced Mean Field Resource Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms play an effective role in timely data collection from ground sensors in remote and hostile areas. Optimizing the collective behavior of swarms can improve data collection performance. This paper puts forth a new mean field flight resource allocation optimization to minimize age of information (AoI) of sensory data, where balancing the trade-off between the UAVs movements and AoI is formulated as a mean field game (MFG). The MFG optimization yields an expansive solution space encompassing continuous state and action, resulting in significant computational complexity. To address practical situations, we propose, a new mean field hybrid proximal policy optimization (MF-HPPO) scheme to minimize the average AoI by optimizing the UAV's trajectories and data collection scheduling of the ground sensors given mixed continuous and discrete actions. Furthermore, a long short term memory (LSTM) is leveraged in MF-HPPO to predict the time-varying network state and stabilize the training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MF-HPPO reduces the average AoI by up to 45 percent and 57 percent in the considered simulation setting, as compared to multi-agent deep Q-learning (MADQN) method and non-learning random algorithm, respectively.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning based Autonomous Multi-Rotor Landing on Moving Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-rotor UAVs suffer from a restricted range and flight duration due to limited battery capacity. Autonomous landing on a 2D moving platform offers the possibility to replenish batteries and offload data, thus increasing the utility of the vehicle. Classical approaches rely on accurate, complex and difficult-to-derive models of the vehicle and the environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides an attractive alternative due to its ability to learn a suitable control policy exclusively from data during a training procedure. However, current methods require several hours to train, have limited success rates and depend on hyperparameters that need to be tuned by trial-and-error. We address all these issues in this work. First, we decompose the landing procedure into a sequence of simpler, but similar learning tasks. This is enabled by applying two instances of the same RL based controller trained for 1D motion for controlling the multi-rotor's movement in both the longitudinal and the lateral directions. Second, we introduce a powerful state space discretization technique that is based on i) kinematic modeling of the moving platform to derive information about the state space topology and ii) structuring the training as a sequential curriculum using transfer learning. Third, we leverage the kinematics model of the moving platform to also derive interpretable hyperparameters for the training process that ensure sufficient maneuverability of the multi-rotor vehicle. The training is performed using the tabular RL method Double Q-Learning. Through extensive simulations we show that the presented method significantly increases the rate of successful landings, while requiring less training time compared to other deep RL approaches. Finally, we deploy and demonstrate our algorithm on real hardware. For all evaluation scenarios we provide statistics on the agent's performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finite-time identification of linear dynamical systems from $T$ samples of a single trajectory. Recent results have predominantly focused on the setup where no structural assumption is made on the system matrix $A^* \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, and have consequently analyzed the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator in detail. We assume prior structural information on $A^*$ is available, which can be captured in the form of a convex set $\mathcal{K}$ containing $A^*$. For the solution of the ensuing constrained least squares estimator, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds in the Frobenius norm that depend on the local size of $\mathcal{K}$ at $A^*$. To illustrate the usefulness of these results, we instantiate them for four examples, namely when (i) $A^*$ is sparse and $\mathcal{K}$ is a suitably scaled $\ell_1$ ball; (ii) $\mathcal{K}$ is a subspace; (iii) $\mathcal{K}$ consists of matrices each of which is formed by sampling a bivariate convex function on a uniform $n \times n$ grid (convex regression); (iv) $\mathcal{K}$ consists of matrices each row of which is formed by uniform sampling (with step size $1/T$) of a univariate Lipschitz function. In all these situations, we show that $A^*$ can be reliably estimated for values of $T$ much smaller than what is needed for the unconstrained setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback control of a two-atom network closed by a semi-infinite waveguide</title>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a coherent feedback network where two two-level atoms are coupled with a semi-infinite waveguide. In this set-up, the two-level atoms can work as the photon source, and the photons can be emitted into the waveguide via the nonchiral or chiral couplings between the atom and the waveguide, according to whether the coupling strengths between the atoms and different directional propagating modes in the waveguide are identical or not. For the photon emitted by one of the two atoms, it can be reflected by the terminal mirror, or interact with the other atom, and then the photon can re-interact with the former atom. When the two atoms are both initially excited, finally there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide via the spontaneous emission and feedback interactions, and this is influenced by the locations of the atoms and the chirality of the coupling between the atom and the waveguide. Similarly, if only one of the two atoms is initially excited, there can be zero or one photon in the waveguide. Thus we can control the number of the photons in the waveguide and the atomic states by tuning the feedback loop length and the chiral couplings between the atom and waveguide. The photonic state in the waveguide is analyzed in the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions can be better understood based on the comprehensive analysis in these two domains.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-based neural representations for computational adaptive optics in widefield microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</description>
