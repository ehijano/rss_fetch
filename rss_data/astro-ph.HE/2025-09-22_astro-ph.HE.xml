      <title>Anisotropic Cosmic Ray Transport resulting from Magnetic Mirroring and Resonant Curvature Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation, and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring, or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a L\'evy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation, and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories which fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of seasonal variations of the muon energy spectrum in air showers to hadronic interaction models and the cosmic-ray mass composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of muons produced in air showers depends not only on the properties of the primary particle, but also on the atmosphere. This is because of the competition between decay and interaction of the parent mesons, which depends on the atmospheric density. As a result, the number of muons at ground shows a seasonal variation, with the strength of the variation depending on the primary cosmic-ray energy, mass, as well as the energy of the detected muons. In this contribution, we study the variations of the muon energy spectrum in air showers using MCEq, a numerical solver of the cascade equations. In particular, we show how the amplitude of the seasonal variations of the number of high-energy (O(TeV)) muons in the shower depends on the primary energy, mass, as well as the assumed hadronic interaction model. A measurement of these variations is possible with the combination of a surface air-shower array and a deep underground detector, which provide a simultaneous measurement of the primary energy and the high-energy muon multiplicity, and may provide a new way to probe the cosmic-ray mass composition and hadronic interactions.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Muon and Pion Cooling on the Neutrino Spectrum of NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected a flux of $\sim 1-10 \, {\rm TeV}$ neutrinos from the active galaxy, NGC 1068. The soft spectral index of these neutrinos has previously been interpreted as an indication that this source accelerates protons only up to energies of several hundred TeV. Here, we propose that this source might instead accelerate protons to significantly higher energies, but that the charged pions and muons produced in their interactions undergo significant synchrotron energy losses before they can decay, leading to a cutoff in the neutrino spectrum at TeV-scale energies. This scenario would require very strong magnetic fields to be present in the acceleration region of NGC 1068, on the order of $B \sim 10^7 \, {\rm G}$. We point out that this synchrotron cooling would impact the flavor ratios of the neutrinos from this source, providing a means to test this scenario with future very-large volume neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>$\nu$SpaceSim: A Comprehensive Simulation Package for Modeling the Measurement of Cosmic Neutrinos using the Earth as the Neutrino Target and Space-based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\nu$SpaceSim is a highly-efficient (e.g., fast) module-based, end-to-end simulation package that models the physical processes of cosmic neutrino interactions that leads to detectable signals for sub-orbital and space-based instruments. Starting with an input flux of neutrinos incident on a user-specified geometry in the Earth, the flux of Earth-emergent leptons are calculated followed by their subsequent extensive air showers (EAS). Next, the EAS optical Cherenkov and radio emission, signal attenuation to the detector, and the detector response are modeled to determine the sensitivity to both the diffuse cosmic neutrinos and transient neutrino sources. Using the Earth as a tau neutrino target and the atmosphere as the signal generator effectively forms a detector with a mega-gigaton mass. Furthermore, \taon decays and neutrino neutral-current interactions within the Earth (re)generates a flux of lower energy tau neutrinos that can also interact in the Earth thus enhancing the detection probability. $\nu$SpaceSim provides a tool to both understand the data from recent experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 as well as design/understand the performance the next generation of balloon- and space-based experiments, including POEMMA Balloon with Radio (PBR) and the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO). In this paper the $\nu$SpaceSim software, physics modeling, and the cosmic neutrino measurement capabilities of example sub-orbital and space-based experimental configurations are presented as well as status of planned modeling upgrades.</description>

      <title>The 2025 outburst of IGR J17511-3057: timing and spectral insights from NICER and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IGR J17511-3057 was observed in a new outburst phase starting in February 2025 and lasting at least nine days. We investigated the spectral and temporal properties of IGR J17511-3057, aiming to characterise its current status and highlight possible long-term evolution of its properties. We analysed the available NICER and NuSTAR observations performed during the latest outburst of the source. We updated the ephemerides of the neutron star and compared them to previous outbursts to investigate its long-term evolution. We also performed spectral analysis of the broadband energy spectrum in different outburst phases, and investigated the time-resolved spectrum of the type-I X-ray burst event observed with NuSTAR. We detected X-ray pulsations at a frequency of around 245 Hz. The long-term evolution of the neutron star ephemerides suggests a spin-down derivative of about -2.3e-15 Hz/s, compatible with a rotation-powered phase while in quiescence. Moreover, the evolution of the orbital period and the time of the ascending node suggests a fast orbital shrinkage, which challenges the standard evolution scenario for this class of pulsars involving angular momentum loss via gravitational wave emission. The spectral analysis revealed a dominant power-law-like Comptonisation component, along with a thermal blackbody component, consistent with a hard state. Weak broad emission residuals around 6.6 keV suggest the presence of a K-alpha transition of neutral or He-like Fe originating from the inner region of the accretion disc. Self-consistent reflection models confirmed a moderate ionisation of the disc truncated at around (82-370) km from the neutron star. Finally, the study of the type-I X-ray burst revealed no signature of photospheric radius expansion. We found marginally significant burst oscillations during the rise and decay of the event, consistent with the neutron star spin frequency.</description>

      <title>Collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores leading to a black hole and a massive disk as a source of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive models of rotating very massive stellar cores with mass $\approx 10^2$--$10^4M_\odot$ which are marginally stable to the pair-unstable collapse, assuming that the core is isentropic and composed primarily of oxygen. It is shown that the cores with mass $\lesssim 10^3M_\odot$ can form a massive disk with the mass more than 10% of the core mass around the formed black hole if the core is rotating with more than 30% of the Keplerian limit. We also indicate that the formation of rapidly spinning massive black holes such as the black holes of GW231123 naturally accompanies the massive disk formation. By using the result of our previous study which showed that the massive disk is unstable to the non-axisymmetric deformation, we predict the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves and show that the collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores can be a promising source of gravitational waves for Einstein Telescope. The detection of such gravitational waves will provide us with important information about a formation process of intermediate mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Three Subpopulations of Merging Binary Black Holes at Different Primary Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the release of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA gravitational-wave catalog (GWTC-4), we are starting to gain a detailed view of the population of merging binary black holes. The formation channels of these black holes is not clearly understood, but different formation mechanisms may lead to subpopulations with different properties visible in gravitational-wave data. Adopting a phenomenological approach, we find GWTC-4 data supports the presence of at least three subpopulations, each associated with a different range of black hole mass and with sharp transition boundaries between them. Each subpopulation is characterized by different distributions for either the mass ratios, the black-hole spin magnitudes or both. Subpopulation A with primary mass $m_1 \leq 27.7^{+4.1}_{-3.4} M_{\odot}$ ($90 \%$ credibility), is characterized by a nearly flat mass ratio distribution $q=m_2/m_1$, and by small spin magnitudes ($\chi \leq 0.5^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$). Subpopulation B with $27.7^{+4.1}_{-3.4} M_{\odot} \leq m_1 \leq 40.2^{+4.7}_{-3.2} M_{\odot}$, has a much sharper preference for mass ratio $q \approx 1$. Subpopulation C, with $m_1 \geq 40.2^{+4.7}_{-3.2} M_{\odot}$, has support for large spin magnitudes, and tentative support for mass ratios $q\approx0.5$. We interpret these transitions as evidence for multiple subpopulations, each potentially associated with a different formation pathways. We suggest potential formation scenarios for each subpopulations, and suggest that Subpopulation B may be associated with chemically homogeneous evolution or population III stars. Our findings for Subpopulation C are largely consistent with recent claims of hierarchical mergers, but with some curious differences in properties.</description>

      <title>Broadband radio study of the supernova remnant Kes 73</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong shocks occurring in supernova remnants (SNRs), and their interaction with an often anisotropic surrounding medium, make SNRs ideal laboratories for studying the production and acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs). Due to their complex morphology and phenomenology, different CR populations are expected to exist throughout the remnants, each characterized by its own energy spectrum. A comprehensive understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms and energetics in SNRs requires spatially resolved spectral and morphological studies. We want to highlight the crucial role of high-resolution radio images at high frequencies (&gt; 10 GHz) for studying the spectral properties of different remnant regions and better constraining the models that describe their non-thermal emission from radio to $\gamma$-ray wavelengths. We studied the integrated radio spectrum of the SNR Kes 73 using single-dish observations performed with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) between 6.9 and 24.8 GHz, complemented by published data. The high-resolution map at 24.8 GHz was used to search for spatial variations in the spectral index across the remnant. We present the SRT images of Kes 73, providing the highest-frequency morphological and spectral characterization ever obtained for this source. By combining our 18.7 and 24.8 GHz maps with previously published interferometric images at 1.4 and 5 GHz, we identify a flatter spectrum in the western bright region compared to the rest of the shell. In the same region, we detect overlapping $^12$CO molecular emission and $\gamma$-ray radiation, providing strong evidence of SNR-molecular cloud interaction and enhanced CR production. We modelled the non-thermal radio to $\gamma$-ray emission from this region, favouring a lepto-hadronic scenario with a maximum electron energy of 1.1 TeV and a magnetic field strength of 25 $\mu$G.</description>

      <title>Search for cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission from local galaxy clusters using Fermi-LAT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. Even if clusters are nearly virialized structures, they undergo merging processes, creating merging shocks, and suffer from feedback from galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei; causing complex turbulent motions and amplifying their magnetic fields. These processes act as acceleration mechanisms for the plasma of the intracluster medium (ICM), originating a population of cosmic rays (CRs). Leptonic CRs have long been detected, but we should also expect a CR hadronic population that, through interactions with the ICM, should produce neutral pions that decay into gamma-rays. The detection of diffuse gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters is one of the long-awaited milestones for the high-energy astroparticle physics community. Still, no unambiguous detection has yet been obtained. In this talk, we will present the results of a combined cluster analysis searching for CR-induced gamma-ray signals, using 16 years of Fermi-LAT data. In our previous work (di Mauro et al. 2023) we obtained from the combined analysis of 49 local galaxy clusters (12 years of data) a hint of signal between 2.5-3 sigma. These results are consistent with other works as well, which consistently find a non-vanishing hint of signal, around the detection threshold. In this new work, we use a sample of near, well-known galaxy clusters and develop CR-induced emission templates using well-established X-ray measurements for calibration, assuming self similarity for the members of our sample. To strengthen the robustness of our analysis, we define benchmark models to encapsulate the uncertainties in the spectral and spatial profiles for the CR-induced emission and perform the standard template-fitting analysis using the likelihood ratio test.</description>

      <title>Absence of Radio Emission Reveals an Exceptionally Weak Explosion of the Putative Historical Supernova Pa 30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first deep radio continuum observations of Pa 30, a nebula hosting a unique optical source driven by an ultrafast outflow with a velocity of 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. The nebula was proposed to be the remnant of a white dwarf merger that occurred in 1181CE. We report no detection of the radio diffuse emission from Pa 30 or radio emission from the central source, setting $3\sigma$ upper limit flux densities of $0.84\,\rm mJy$ and $0.29\,\rm mJy$ at 1.5 GHz and 6 GHz, respectively, for Pa 30. The radio surface brightness of Pa 30 is $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude smaller than that of typical supernova remnants (SNRs) with comparable angular size. If Pa 30 is an SNR, our observations show it to be the faintest known in the radio band. Considering that 10\% of the supernova (SN) kinetic energy is transferred to cosmic rays (CRs), the absence of radio synchrotron emission suggests that the SN kinetic energy $\lesssim3\times 10^{47}(B/10 \mu\rm G)^{-1.65}$ erg, which is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of typical SNRs and the lowest measured among Galactic SNRs. There is also an indication of inefficient CR acceleration for this source. The low SN kinetic energy either implies the potential existence of many more radio-faint, sub-energetic SNRs in our Galaxy or challenges the SNR interpretation of Pa 30.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a brief appearance of gamma-ray periodicity after a compact star merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The product of a compact star merger is usually hypothesized to be a hyperaccreting black hole, typically resulting in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration shorter than 2~s. However, recent observations of GRB~211211A and GRB~230307A, both arising from compact star mergers, challenge this model due to their minute-long durations. The data from both events are consistent with having a nascent, rapidly spinning highly magnetized neutron star (a millisecond magnetar) as the merger product and GRB engine, but a smoking gun signature is still missing. Here we report strong but not yet conclusive evidence for the detection of a 909-Hz gamma-ray periodic signal during a brief time window of GRB~230307A, which is consistent with the rotation frequency of such a millisecond magnetar. Notably, the periodic signal appeared for only 160~ms at an epoch coinciding with the transition epoch when the jet emission from the GRB central engine ceased and when the delayed emission from high latitudes started. If this signal is real, the temporal and spectral features of this gamma-ray periodicity can be consistently interpreted as asymmetric mini-jet emission from a dissipating Poynting-flux-dominated jet, as revealed by the energy-dependent light curve data of this burst.</description>

      <title>Simulating radio emission from extensive air showers with CORSIKA 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CORSIKA 8 is a modern, flexible framework for simulating particle cascades in air and dense media, allowing for fully customizable shower simulations. The radio module autonomously handles electric field calculations and propagation to observer locations. It supports simultaneous simulations with both the ``Endpoint formalism'' as implemented in CoREAS and the ``ZHS'' algorithm from ZHAireS. In this contribution, we validate the radio module by comparing air-shower simulations in CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7, and ZHAireS. We investigate the impact of simulation parameters, such as the step size of particle tracks, on the resulting radio signals and perform a detailed comparison of the ``Endpoints'' and ``ZHS'' formalisms. For the same underlying showers simulated with CORSIKA 8 with optimized step sizes, both formalisms converge to the same radiation energy within 2%. For CORSIKA 8 and CORSIKA 7, agreement on the radiation energy is better than 10% in the 30-80 MHz band and improves to better than 2% for 50-350 MHz. This consistency provides further confirmation of the accuracy of microscopic air-shower radio emission simulations which is crucial for precise energy scale estimations using radio detection.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Galactic Center in the Sub-MeV Gamma-Ray Band with an Electron-Tracking Compton Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center in the 150-600 keV band using a linear, imaging-spectroscopy approach used in common telescopes with an electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC) aboard the SMILE-2+ balloon experiment. A one-day flight over Australia resulted in a significant gamma-ray detection in the light curve and revealed a $7.9\sigma$ excess in the image map from the Galactic center region. These results, obtained through a simple and unambiguous analysis, demonstrate the high reliability and sensitivity of the ETCC and establish its potential for future high-precision MeV gamma-ray observations. The measured intensity and spatial distribution were tested against three emission models: a single point-like source, a multi-component structure, and a symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian. All models were found to be statistically consistent with the data. The positronium-related flux in the multi-component model is $(3.2~\pm~1.4)~\times~10^{-2}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is approximately a factor of two higher than the value reported by INTEGRAL, with a discrepancy at the $2\sigma$ level. This difference may arise from unresolved sources or truly diffuse emission, such as exotic processes involving light dark matter or primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>A new view of UHECRs with the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In its Phase I, the Pierre Auger Observatory has led to several observations, driving the field of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) research over the last 20 years. Major achievements obtained so far include the unprecedented precise energy spectrum and its features, the observables linked to the UHECR mass composition and the distribution of arrival directions of the most energetic events. These results, together with the non-observation of high-energy neutrinos and photons, strongly disfavor the pre-Auger pure-proton paradigm. In this talk, we will provide an overview on the main results of the Observatory, and describe possible astrophysical scenarios for their interpretation. The prospects of improving the current understanding about UHECR characteristics during the Phase II of the Observatory will be also shown.</description>

      <title>Fifteen years of Gamma-Ray Burst observations at Very High Energies with H.E.S.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) follow-up observations of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) between 2004 and 2019. We are focusing on non-detections and providing the most extensive set of very-high-energy (VHE, &gt;100 GeV) upper limits to date. We use this catalogue to constrain the properties of VHE-detected GRBs and compare them to those detected at VHE. Our study finds that VHE-detected GRBs are not a distinct population but are instead associated with bright X-ray afterglows and low redshifts. In addition, we model the multi-wavelength emission of a few of the observed GRBs and discuss the results in the context of their obtained microphysical parameters. The results from this work help put current VHE observations into perspective and highlight the capabilities of next-generation instruments, in detecting fainter and more distant GRBs at VHE.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT -- XVIII. Complex sub-pulse modulation patterns, bi-drifting and mode changing of nine radio pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of sub-pulse modulations in nine pulsars which show evidence of changes in sub-pulse drift direction as a function of pulse longitude in the Thousand Pulsar Array single pulse survey with MeerKAT. We confirm that all of these are consistent with persistent drift direction changes. These 'bi-drifting' pulsars present a challenge to the classical carousel model for sub-pulse drifting. In general, bi-drifting in this expanded sample is less clear than some of the previously published cases, which we attribute to narrower profile widths ($&lt;20$ degrees) or smaller $P_3$ values (close to 2$P$). However, given the broad variety of pulse shapes and drift behaviours across the pulsar population, it is unsurprising that the phenomenon is not limited to only those where it can most easily be detected. Four of our samples show at least two emission modes with different profile shapes and drift properties, which seems to be a relatively common feature of bi-drifting pulsars. We also find jumps in sub-pulse phase between adjacent components in two pulsars. In addition to our MeerKAT L-band data, we used GMRT observations for four, and MeerKAT UHF observations for two of these pulsars to investigate the frequency dependence of sub-pulse drift. We find subtle changes in the drift as a function of frequency, but no clear overall pattern. Looking at the distribution of bi-drifting pulsars over $P$, $\dot{P}$ and $P_3$ suggests they are consistent with the underlying population of all drifting pulsars.</description>

      <title>Why Do We See So Few Black Holes in Massive Binaries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer a simple explanation for the small number of black holes observed in pairs with massive stars. In detached massive binaries, spherically symmetric accretion takes place. This accretion could result in effective energy release in the hard band only if the equipartition of the gravitational and magnetic energy of plasma is established (Shvartsmans theorem). However, we show that due to the magnetic exhaust effect this equilibrium is virtually never established for the actual magnetic fields observed on massive stars: Shvartsmans theorem does not work. As a result, it is virtually impossible to detect black holes in detached massive binaries by currently available means (mainly, through X-ray observations).</description>

      <title>Pair luminosity and cooling of newborn strange star I. Noninteracting quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown that pair luminosity of the newborn strange star with temperature of $10^{11}$ K may be as high as $L_\pm\simeq 10^{52}$ erg/s. The question remains: can a strange star maintain such a high surface temperature for a long time? To answer this question we studied thermal evolution of newborn strange star taking into account thermal conductivity of free quarks and neutrino emission by the URCA process. Our results show that extremely high luminosity due to the Schwinger process and insufficient thermal conductivity of quarks leads to development of steep temperature gradient at the surface of strange star. As a result, the temperature at the surface and hence its luminosity decreases as a power law, reaching $10^{40}$ erg/s already at 10 ms. This result holds even in the presence of neutrinosphere.</description>

      <title>Expected Constraints on the Intergalactic Magnetic Field using Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The InterGalactic Magnetic Field (IGMF), which could permeate the cosmic voids but was never detected so far, is considered a relic of the early Universe. Constraints on its strength $B$ can be derived from its influence on time-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the electromagnetic cascades along their path to the Earth. The present lower limit achieved on its intensity is $10^{-18}\;\mathrm{G}$. In this work, we simulate data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), accounting for realistic observational constraints, and we apply a joint spectral and temporal fit to characterize the IGMF. GRBs 190114C and 221009A are used as test cases to assess the sensitivity of CTAO. They demonstrate that a broad range of IGMF strengths can be probed with a lower bound as high as $10^{-15}\;\mathrm{G}$. Notably, we show that observations by the CTAO first large telescope, LST-1, already allow us to exclude field strengths up to $3\times 10^{-17}\;\mathrm{G}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantized vortices under quasi-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is widely used for vortex dynamics, but finite domains with hard walls or confining potentials distort bulk behavior through vortex-image effects or induced flows. Periodic boundaries reduce wall artifacts yet cannot realize finite net vorticity because of topological obstruction, so bulk simulations with non-zero circulation are typically unavailable. Hence, we impose quasi-periodic boundary conditions that keep the superfluid's density periodic while enforcing phase windings consistent with a net prescribed total vorticity. This setting conserves the net number of vortices and enables long-time tracking of vortex trajectories in settings that finite containers cannot capture. This allows us to study vortex depinning and nucleation leading to the creation of K\'arm\'an vortex streets and the creation of perfectly periodic vortex arrays. The framework also provides a toy model for studying vortex dynamics in the bulk of neutron stars, free of possible limitations induced by confining potentials.</description>

      <title>Neutron star evolution with BDNK viscous hydrodynamics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed first-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics formulation by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (commonly known as the BDNK formulation) has been shown to be causal, stable, strongly hyperbolic, and thus locally well-posed. It is now a viable new option for modelling out-of-equilibrium effects in fluids, and has attracted wide attention in its potential applications to astrophysical systems. In this work, we present the first non-linear numerical simulation of spherically symmetric neutron stars using the BDNK formulation under the Cowling approximation. Using a simplified equation of state, we show that stable evolutions can be constructed within a restricted parameter space up to the simulation time we explored. From these simulations, we analyse the frequency content of the quasi-normal modes and the decay rate of the fundamental mode. This analysis serves as a first step towards constructing a fully consistent model of neutron stars using the BDNK formulation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of $K^-$ condensation on neutron star structure and $f-$mode frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antikaon ($K^-$) condensation within neutron star matter (NS) depends on the antikaon-nucleon interaction potential ($U_K$). Appearance of $K^-$ generally softens the equation of state (EOS). The impact of this softening on the structure of the NS can be leveraged to find a telltale sign of the phase transition from nucleonic matter to $K^-$ condensation. To investigate the impact of $K^-$ condensation on NS properties using a Bayesian inference framework, we choose two sets of RMF model parameters to obtain a stiff (DD2) and relatively soft (FSU) nucleonic EOS, and explore a wide range of optical potential depths. Multimessenger observations from NICER and LIGO/Virgo constrain the optical potential values to $U_K = -104.72^{+13.82}_{-12.48}$ MeV and $U_K = -66.46^{+2.47}_{-3.42}$ MeV for the stiff and soft cases, respectively. Deeper $K^-$ potentials trigger condensation at a lower density, softening the EOS and lowering the corresponding maximum masses. While slopes of mass-radius and tidal deformability curves overlap between nucleonic and exotic EOSs, their curvature and $f-$mode oscillation properties (frequency and damping time) reveal features attributable to EOS softening. However, distinguishing the specific exotic degrees of freedom responsible for the softening remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>Optimizing HERON for 100 PeV Neutrino Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to target the astrophysical flux of Earth-skimming tau neutrinos at 100 PeV. HERON consists of multiple compact, phased radio arrays embedded within a larger sparse array of antennas, located on the side of a mountain. This hybrid design provides both excellent sensitivity and a sub-degree pointing resolution. To design HERON, a suite of simulations accounting for tau propagation, shower development, radio emission, and antenna response were used. These simulations were used to discover the array layout which provides maximum sensitivity at 100 PeV, as well to select the optimal antenna design. Additionally, the event reconstruction accuracy has been tested for various designs of the sparse array via simulated interferometry. Here, we present the HERON simulation procedure and its results.</description>

      <title>Predictions of Neutrino Fluxes at the Forward Physics Facility at the High-Luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have traditionally focused on particle production at small pseudorapidities. However, to further utilize the valuable data from particles produced at the ATLAS interaction point along the beamline, the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) aims to study particle production in the far-forward region at the high-luminosity LHC. The FPF will house a suite of experiments with the ability of enhancing hadronic interaction models by measurement of the resulting neutrino fluxes. These advancements are critical for astroparticle physics, linking forward scattering processes to extensive air showers and improving our understanding of cosmic-ray interactions. This work investigates simulated neutrino fluxes in the far-forward region from proton-proton collisions at ATLAS, analyzing final state particles propagated to this new facility. Results from this simulation provide theoretical expectations for the neutrino fluxes at the FPF, offering insights to refine hadronic interaction models, including the most recently developed, and better estimate atmospheric neutrino backgrounds in astrophysical neutrino telescopes.</description>

Abstract: Undergraduate research in STEM can be a transformative experience, especially for Community College students, many of whom come from under-represented backgrounds. However, undergraduate research at Community Colleges is relatively rare, due in part to their focus on teaching excellence. Research partnerships with four year colleges about exciting and accessible science topics, facilitated by researchers such as postdoctoral fellows, can be a powerful path forward. We describe our program, the Dead Stars Society (DSS), as a successful example of such a research partnership, focused on the topic of observational astronomy, specifically stellar science with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and X-ray astronomy with Chandra, NICER and NuSTAR.</description>

      <title>The new architecture design of the Science Alert Generation pipeline of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) represents the next-generation gamma-ray observatory and will operate for several decades. It will be particularly suited to analyse transients and variable phenomena, which will trigger real-time scientific alerts. To support this, the Science Alert Generation (SAG) pipeline within the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA) system will process data from telescope arrays in real time, using dedicated pipelines for data reconstruction (SAG-RECO), data quality monitoring (SAG-DQ) and science monitoring (SAG-SCI). The Supervisor (SAG-SUP) oversees the dynamic operations of SAG and its integration with other ACADA components. SAG is designed to issue candidate science alerts within 20 s of data availability, processing events on multiple time scales (seconds to hours) and handling trigger rates of tens of kHz. Meeting these requirements necessitates optimised software and hardware architectures. This work presents recent developments in SAG's architecture, aimed at two main challenges: (1) selecting data only from telescopes that have entered a stable tracking state, even when they begin tracking at different times during multi-telescope observations, and (2) incorporating environmental and system monitoring information to ensure high data quality. SAG-SUP can retrieve real-time telescope status and environmental conditions from telescope managers and the weather station through the ACADA Monitoring system, collect them in a database and then use them to filter out data from slewing phases or degraded conditions. These enhancements are crucial to ensure the reliability of science alerts and improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the CTAO real-time analysis framework.</description>

      <title>A New Broadband Spectral State in the Ultraluminous X-ray Source Holmberg IX X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a series of five new broadband X-ray observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source Holmberg IX X-1, performed by $XMM$-$Newton$ and $NuSTAR$ in coordination. The first three of these show high soft X-ray fluxes but a near total collapse of the high-energy ($\gtrsim$15 keV) emission, previously seen to be surprisingly stable across all prior broadband observations of the source. The latter two show a recovery in hard X-rays, remarkably once again respecting the same stable high-energy flux exhibited by all of the archival observations. We also present a joint analysis of all broadband observations of Holmberg IX X-1 to date (encompassing 11 epochs in total) in order to investigate whether it shows the same luminosity-temperature behaviour as NGC 1313 X-1 (which also shows a stable high-energy flux), whereby the hotter disc component in the spectrum exhibits two distinct, positively-correlated tracks in the luminosity-temperature plane. Holmberg IX X-1 may show similar behaviour, but the results depend on whether the highest energy emission is assumed to be an up-scattering corona or an accretion column. The strongest evidence for this behaviour is found in the former case, while in the latter the new 'soft' epochs appear distinct from the other high-flux epochs. We discuss possible explanations for these new 'soft' spectra in the context of the expected structure of super-Eddington accretion flows around black holes and neutron stars, and highlight a potentially interesting analogy with the recent destruction and re-creation of the corona seen in the AGN 1ES 1927+654.</description>

      <title>A Black Hole is Born: 3D GRMHD Simulation of Black Hole Formation from Core-Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulation of a black hole (BH) formed from the collapsed core of a massive star. The ability to self-consistently capture the birth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties (including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained elusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse, core-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar progenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a one-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45 M_\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from stellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The collapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km before stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron star accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t_{BH} \approx 325$ ms after core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably similar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the horizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity of $v_{kick} \approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M_{BH} \approx 2.62 M_\odot$, which is still rising at the end of the simulation.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission of the Nuclear Stellar Disk as seen by SRG/ART-XC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD), together with the Nuclear Stellar Cluster and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, forms the central region of the Milky Way. Galactic X-ray background emission is known to be associated with the old stellar population, predominantly produced by accreting white dwarfs. In this work we characterize the X-ray emission of the Galactic Center (GC) region using wide-field observations with the ART-XC telescope on board the SRG observatory in the 4-12 keV energy band. Our analysis demonstrates that the X-ray emission of the GC at a spatial scale of a few hundred parsecs is dominated by the regularly shaped NSD aligned in the Galactic plane, and characterized by latitudinal and longitudinal scale heights of approximately 20 pc and approximately 100 pc, respectively. The measured flux, 6.8 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 4-12 keV band, corresponds to a luminosity of 5.9 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^36 erg/s, assuming the GC distance of 8.178 kpc. The average mass-normalized X-ray emissivity of the NSD, 5.6 (+0.5, -0.7) x 10^27 erg/s/M_sun, exceeds the corresponding value of the Galactic ridge by a factor of 3.3 (+0.4, -0.5), confirming other studies. We also perform a deprojection of the observed NSD surface brightness distribution in order to construct a three-dimensional X-ray luminosity density model, which can be directly compared to the existing 3D stellar mass models. Finally, we conclude that the spatial distribution of the X-ray emission from the NSD is consistent with the most recent stellar mass density distribution model within 30%, which suggests that this emission is dominated by unresolved point X-ray sources rather than by diffuse X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>From collider to cosmic rays: Pythia 8/Angantyr for air shower simulations in CORSIKA 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of extensive air showers is pivotal for advancing our understanding of high-energy cosmic ray interactions in Earth's atmosphere. The CORSIKA 8 framework is being developed as a modern, flexible, and efficient tool for simulating these interactions with a variety of high-energy hadronic models. We present the ongoing implementation and validation of Pythia 8/Angantyr within CORSIKA 8. Pythia 8, successfully used in collider physics, provides a detailed and well-tested treatment of hadronic interactions, while the Angantyr model extends its capabilities to describe heavy-ion collisions in a consistent manner. With the inclusion of Pythia 8, the CORSIKA 8 suite now enables further tuning possibilities, improving the exploration of hadronic interactions in air showers.
  In this contribution, we compare the capability of Pythia 8/Angantyr to reproduce fundamental observables of high-energy particle collisions $-$ inelastic cross-sections and multiplicities $-$ to that of several established high-energy interaction models in air shower simulations. We further compare the predictions for key air shower properties, including longitudinal shower development and muon content, for iron-induced shower.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Polarimetric Structure of Jets from Radio Galaxy MRC 0600-399 in A3376</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MRC 0600-399, in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3376, is one of the unique Head-Tail radio galaxies having abruptly bending structures, the origin of which is still under discussion. A previous study suggested that the interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the jet propagates the long distance keeping the sharp shape. In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600-399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L-band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed the Pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function 3D cube. MRC 0600-399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600-399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with the other observation, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.</description>

      <title>HST Deep Upper Limits Rule Out a Surviving Massive Binary Companion to the Type Ic Supernova 2012fh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current explanations of the mass-loss mechanism for stripped-envelope supernovae remain divided between single and binary progenitor systems. Here we obtain deep ultraviolet (UV) imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the Type Ic SN 2012fh to search for the presence of a surviving companion star to the progenitor. We synthesize these observations with archival HST imaging, ground-based spectroscopy, and previous analyses from the literature to provide three independent constraints on the progenitor system. We fit the color-magnitude diagram of the surrounding population to constrain the most likely age of the system to be $&lt;20$ Myr. Analysis of spectra of SN 2012fh provide an estimate of the He core mass of the progenitor star, $&gt;5.6$ M$_{\odot}$. We analyze deep HST images at the precise location after the SN faded to constrain the luminosity of any remaining main-sequence binary companion to be $\log(L/L_{\odot}) \lesssim 3.35$. Combining observational constraints with current binary population synthesis models excludes the presence of a faint stellar companion to SN 2012fh at the $\lesssim10\%$ level. The progenitor was therefore either effectively isolated at the time of explosion or orbited by a black-hole companion. The latter scenario dominates if we only consider models that produce successful supernovae.</description>

      <title>Smooth binary evolution from wide resonances in boson clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes. These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.</description>
