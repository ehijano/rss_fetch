      <title>GAMMA-PD: Graph-based Analysis of Multi-Modal Motor Impairment Assessments in Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of medical technology has led to an exponential increase in multi-modal medical data, including imaging, genomics, and electronic health records (EHRs). Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to represent this data due to their prominent performance in capturing pairwise relationships. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of multi-modal medical data still pose significant challenges for standard GNNs, which struggle with learning higher-order, non-pairwise relationships. This paper proposes GAMMA-PD (Graph-based Analysis of Multi-modal Motor Impairment Assessments in Parkinson's Disease), a novel heterogeneous hypergraph fusion framework for multi-modal clinical data analysis. GAMMA-PD integrates imaging and non-imaging data into a "hypernetwork" (patient population graph) by preserving higher-order information and similarity between patient profiles and symptom subtypes. We also design a feature-based attention-weighted mechanism to interpret feature-level contributions towards downstream decision tasks. We evaluate our approach with clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and a private dataset. We demonstrate gains in predicting motor impairment symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Our end-to-end framework also learns associations between subsets of patient characteristics to generate clinically relevant explanations for disease and symptom profiles.

      <title>Regional End-Systolic Circumferential Strain Demonstrates Reduced Function in Remote Myocardium after Anterior STEMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with severe adverse remodeling and increased mortality rates. In this study, anterior STEMI patients were treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention and then imaged with cardiac magnetic resonance 1-2 days later. The cine images were analyzed with computational feature-tracking algorithms to assess end-systolic circumferential (ESC) strain. It was found that contractile function is not only depressed in the infarct and border zone regions, but also in the remote myocardium. This is contrary to other types of infarctions where remote myocardium shows enhanced compensatory function. Quantifying ESC could help identify high risk patients.</description>

      <title>ANTIPASTI: interpretable prediction of antibody binding affinity exploiting Normal Modes and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high binding affinity of antibodies towards their cognate targets is key to eliciting effective immune responses, as well as to the use of antibodies as research and therapeutic tools. Here, we propose ANTIPASTI, a Convolutional Neural Network model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in the prediction of antibody binding affinity using as input a representation of antibody-antigen structures in terms of Normal Mode correlation maps derived from Elastic Network Models. This representation captures not only structural features but energetic patterns of local and global residue fluctuations. The learnt representations are interpretable: they reveal similarities of binding patterns among antibodies targeting the same antigen type, and can be used to quantify the importance of antibody regions contributing to binding affinity. Our results show the importance of the antigen imprint in the Normal Mode landscape, and the dominance of cooperative effects and long-range correlations between antibody regions to determine binding affinity.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Games for Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization with Application to Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework to optimize black-box expensive-to-evaluate functions via sequential interactions. In several important problems (e.g. drug discovery, circuit design, neural architecture search, etc.), though, such functions are defined over large $\textit{combinatorial and unstructured}$ spaces. This makes existing BO algorithms not feasible due to the intractable maximization of the acquisition function over these domains. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{GameOpt}$, a novel game-theoretical approach to combinatorial BO. $\textbf{GameOpt}$ establishes a cooperative game between the different optimization variables, and selects points that are game $\textit{equilibria}$ of an upper confidence bound acquisition function. These are stable configurations from which no variable has an incentive to deviate$-$ analog to local optima in continuous domains. Crucially, this allows us to efficiently break down the complexity of the combinatorial domain into individual decision sets, making $\textbf{GameOpt}$ scalable to large combinatorial spaces. We demonstrate the application of $\textbf{GameOpt}$ to the challenging $\textit{protein design}$ problem and validate its performance on four real-world protein datasets. Each protein can take up to $20^{X}$ possible configurations, where $X$ is the length of a protein, making standard BO methods infeasible. Instead, our approach iteratively selects informative protein configurations and very quickly discovers highly active protein variants compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Seasonal Dengue Dynamics in Bangladesh: A Bayesian-Stochastic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bangladesh's worsening dengue crisis, fueled by its tropical climate, poor waste management infrastructure, rapid urbanization, and dense population, has led to increasingly deadly outbreaks, posing a significant public health threat. To address this, we propose a nonlinear, time-nonhomogeneous SEIR model incorporating seasonality through a novel transmission rate function. The model parameters are estimated using Bayesian inference with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, calibrated with real-life dengue data from Bangladesh. To account for stochasticity and better assess outbreak probabilities, we extend the model to a time-nonhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) framework. Our model provides new insights that can guide policymakers and offer a robust mathematical framework to better combat this crisis.</description>

      <title>Compressing Recurrent Neural Networks for FPGA-accelerated Implementation in Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is an important technique for studying cellular environments and molecular interactions, but its real-time application is limited by slow data acquisition, which requires capturing large time-resolved images and complex post-processing using iterative fitting algorithms. Deep learning (DL) models enable real-time inference, but can be computationally demanding due to complex architectures and large matrix operations. This makes DL models ill-suited for direct implementation on field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based camera hardware. Model compression is thus crucial for practical deployment for real-time inference generation. In this work, we focus on compressing recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are well-suited for FLI time-series data processing, to enable deployment on resource-constrained FPGA boards. We perform an empirical evaluation of various compression techniques, including weight reduction, knowledge distillation (KD), post-training quantization (PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT), to reduce model size and computational load while preserving inference accuracy. Our compressed RNN model, Seq2SeqLite, achieves a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly at 8-bit precision. By applying KD, the model parameter size was reduced by 98\% while retaining performance, making it suitable for concurrent real-time FLI analysis on FPGA during data capture. This work represents a big step towards integrating hardware-accelerated real-time FLI analysis for fast biological processes.</description>

      <title>Generating Seamless Virtual Immunohistochemical Whole Slide Images with Content and Color Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains play a vital role in a pathologist's analysis of medical images, providing crucial diagnostic information for various diseases. Virtual staining from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) allows the automatic production of other useful IHC stains without the expensive physical staining process. However, current virtual WSI generation methods based on tile-wise processing often suffer from inconsistencies in content, texture, and color at tile boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to artifacts that compromise image quality and potentially hinder accurate clinical assessment and diagnoses. To address this limitation, we propose a novel consistent WSI synthesis network, CC-WSI-Net, that extends GAN models to produce seamless synthetic whole slide images. Our CC-WSI-Net integrates a content- and color-consistency supervisor, ensuring consistency across tiles and facilitating the generation of seamless synthetic WSIs while ensuring Sox10 immunohistochemistry accuracy in melanocyte detection. We validate our method through extensive image-quality analyses, objective detection assessments, and a subjective survey with pathologists. By generating high-quality synthetic WSIs, our method opens doors for advanced virtual staining techniques with broader applications in research and clinical care.</description>

Abstract: In the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics data, detecting spatially variable genes (SVGs) is crucial. Numerous computational methods exist, but varying SVG definitions and methodologies lead to incomparable results. We review 33 state-of-the-art methods, categorizing SVGs into three types: overall, cell-type-specific, and spatial-domain-marker SVGs. Our review explains the intuitions underlying these methods, summarizes their applications, and categorizes the hypothesis tests they use in the trade-off between generality and specificity for SVG detection. We discuss challenges in SVG detection and propose future directions for improvement. Our review offers insights for method developers and users, advocating for category-specific benchmarking.</description>

      <title>SOWAHA as a Cancer Suppressor Gene Influence Metabolic Reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SOWAHA is a protein-coding gene, also known as ANKRD43. Studies have indicated that SOWAHA can serve as a prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer. However, there are few reports about SOWAHA in other types of cancer and the specific mechanism of action of SOWAHA in cancer is also not clear. Based on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), cBioPortal, Human Protein Atlas (HPA), etc., we adopted bioinformatics methods to uncover the potential tumor genomic features of SOWAHA, including the correlation with prognosis, gene mutation, immune cell infiltration, and DNA methylation in different tumors and evaluated the association with tumor heterogeneity, stemness, chemokines chemokine receptors, and immunomodulators in pan-cancer. Besides, we knocked down SOWAHA in SW620 cells and performed RNA-seq analysis, then we conducted functional enrichment to uncover the biological significance of the gene set. SOWAHA has early diagnostic potential, and low expression of SOWAHA was associated with poor prognosis in was associated with poor prognosis in GBMLGG, PAAD, READ, etc. SOWAHA is associated with most tumor immune-infiltrating cells in pan-cancer. SOWAHA correlates with DNA methylation, tumor heterogeneity, and stemness in many epithelial carcinomas. Furthermore, SOWAHA is involved in many enzyme activity and metabolic pathways, mainly metabolic programming pathways in cancer. Additionally, we identified two potential transcription factors of SOWAHA, TBX4, and FOXP2, which are dysregulated in SW620 cells. Besides, the cell proliferation and viability in siSOWAHA groups are better than in siNC groups.SOWAHA, identified as a suppressor gene, and its role in the progression of colorectal cancer is primarily mediated through metabolic reprogramming mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A primer on the use of probability generating functions in infectious disease modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.05136v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of probability generating functions (PGFs) to invasive processes, focusing on infectious disease introduced into large populations. Our goal is to acquaint the reader with applications of PGFs, moreso than to derive new results. PGFs help predict a number of properties about early outbreak behavior while the population is still effectively infinite, including the probability of an epidemic, the size distribution after some number of generations, and the cumulative size distribution of non-epidemic outbreaks. We show how PGFs can be used in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings, and discuss how to use these results to infer disease parameters from observed outbreaks. In the large population limit for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemics PGFs lead to survival-function based models that are equivalent the the usual mass-action SIR models but with fewer ODEs. We use these to explore properties such as the final size of epidemics or even the dynamics once stochastic effects are negligible. We target this tutorial to biologists and public health researchers who want to learn how to apply PGFs to invasive diseases, but it could also be used in an introductory mathematics course on PGFs. We include many exercises to help demonstrate concepts and to give practice applying the results. We summarize our main results in a few tables. Additionally we provide a small python package which performs many of the relevant calculations.</description>

      <title>A motion-based compression algorithm for resource-constrained video camera traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field-captured video facilitates detailed studies of spatio-temporal aspects of animal locomotion, decision-making and environmental interactions including predator-prey relationships and habitat utilisation. But even though data capture is cheap with mass-produced hardware, storage, processing and transmission overheads provide a hurdle to acquisition of high resolution video from field-situated edge computing devices. Efficient compression algorithms are therefore essential if monitoring is to be conducted on single-board computers in situations where such hurdles must be overcome. Animal motion tracking in the field has unique characteristics that necessitate the use of novel video compression techniques, which may be underexplored or unsuitable in other contexts. In this article, we therefore introduce a new motion analysis-based video compression algorithm specifically designed for camera traps. We implemented and tested this algorithm using a case study of insect-pollinator motion tracking on three popular edge computing platforms. The algorithm identifies and stores only image regions depicting motion relevant to pollination monitoring, reducing overall data size by an average of 87% across diverse test datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the algorithm's capability to preserve critical information for insect behaviour analysis through both manual observation and automatic analysis of the compressed footage. The method presented in this paper enhances the applicability of low-powered computer vision edge devices to remote, in situ animal motion monitoring, and improves the efficiency of playback during behavioural analyses. Our new software, EcoMotionZip, is available Open Access.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Models for Controllable RNA Sequence Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents RNAdiffusion, a latent diffusion model for generating and optimizing discrete RNA sequences of variable lengths. RNA is a key intermediary between DNA and protein, exhibiting high sequence diversity and complex three-dimensional structures to support a wide range of functions. We utilize pretrained BERT-type models to encode raw RNA sequences into token-level, biologically meaningful representations. A Query Transformer is employed to compress such representations into a set of fixed-length latent vectors, with an autoregressive decoder trained to reconstruct RNA sequences from these latent variables. We then develop a continuous diffusion model within this latent space. To enable optimization, we integrate the gradients of reward models--surrogates for RNA functional properties--into the backward diffusion process, thereby generating RNAs with high reward scores. Empirical results confirm that RNAdiffusion generates non-coding RNAs that align with natural distributions across various biological metrics. Further, we fine-tune the diffusion model on mRNA 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) and optimize sequences for high translation efficiencies. Our guided diffusion model effectively generates diverse 5'-UTRs with high Mean Ribosome Loading (MRL) and Translation Efficiency (TE), outperforming baselines in balancing rewards and structural stability trade-off. Our findings hold potential for advancing RNA sequence-function research and therapeutic RNA design.</description>
