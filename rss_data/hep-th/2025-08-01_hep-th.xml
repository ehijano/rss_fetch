      <title>Harmonic Superspace for Ali-Ilahi's ADHM Instanton Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ADHM Yang-Mills instantons are extended field theoretical objects. These are more general than the more familiar 't Hooft Yang-Mills instantons. Their counter parts exist in string theory in terms of sigma models. Nearly three decades ago Witten constructed a (0,4) supersymmetric linear sigma model incorporating ADHM instantons. Witten's construction was in component form. Galperin and Sokatchev constructed the corresponding off-shell supersymmetric version using the harmonic superspace. Recently Ali and Ilahi constructed an ADHM instanton linear sigma model that is complementary, in the sense of being dual, to the original model constructed by Witten. Full (0,4) supersymmetric off-shell harmonic superspace formalism for Ali-Ilahi's complementary ADHM instanton sigma model is developed in this note.</description>

      <title>A Note on the AdS/CFT Equivalence Transformation for Galileons in General Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AdS/CFT equivalence transformation is a field redefinition that relates the Weyl dilaton and AdS brane realizations of broken conformal symmetry. Acting on theories with second order equations of motion, it maps the conformal galileons to the DBI galileons for a flat brane probing an AdS bulk. Here we extend this map to arbitrary dimensions and resolve an apparent puzzle regarding the Wess-Zumino terms in odd dimensions.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional spectrum generating algebra for the superstring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the spectrum generating algebra for the hybrid string with manifest $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Poincar\'e symmetry in $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}\times\mathbb{R}^{6}$. Our DDF operators establish a one-to-one correspondence with the conventional superstring spectrum, while making its four-dimensional structure manifest. We also discuss part of the antifield spectrum, and introduce a simple realization of the supersymmetry charges involving the $\mathbb{R}^{6}$ directions. As an application, we algebraically compute the helicity partition function. These results provide new tools for analyzing four-dimensional on-shell superspaces and may extend naturally to phenomenologically relevant compactifications.</description>

      <title>Thermal $n$-Point Conformal Blocks in Four Dimensions from Oscillator Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and compute the four-dimensional thermal $n$-point conformal block in the projection channel using oscillator representations on $\mathbb{S}^1_\beta \times \mathbb{S}^3$. This is done by evaluating a class of integrals over the homogeneous space $\mathbb{D}_4$ of the four-dimensional conformal group. We restrict ourselves to scalar external operators and scalar exchange. In the low-temperature limit, our result reduces correctly to the vacuum $(n+2)$-point block in the comb channel. The corresponding expressions can be written as a series of terminating hypergeometric functions or equivalently, a series of weighted SU(2) spin-networks. Alternatively, functions adapted to the SU(2,2) representation are introduced and some properties are discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Conserved Currents and Continuous Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embark on a systematic study of continuous non-invertible symmetries, focusing on 1+1d CFTs. We describe a generalized version of Noether's theorem, where continuous non-invertible symmetries are associated to $\textit{non-local}$ conserved currents: point-like operators attached to extended topological defects. The generalized Noether's theorem unifies several constructions of continuous non-invertible symmetries in the literature, and allows us to exhibit many more examples in diverse theories of interest. We first review known examples which are non-intrinsic (i.e., invertible up to gauging), and then describe $\textit{new}$ examples in Wess-Zumino-Witten models and products of minimal models. For some of these new examples, we show that these continuous non-invertible symmetries are intrinsic if we demand that a certain global symmetry is preserved. The continuous non-invertible symmetries in products of minimal models also allow us to construct new examples of defect conformal manifolds in a single copy of a minimal model. Finally, we comment on continuous non-invertible symmetries in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Spherically Symmetric Causal Diamond in Minkowski Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute a gravitational on-shell action of a finite, spherically symmetric causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, finding it is proportional to the area of the bifurcate horizon $A_{\mathcal{B}}$. We then identify the on-shell action with the saddle point of the Euclidean gravitational path integral, which is naturally interpreted as a partition function. This partition function is thermal with respect to a modular Hamiltonian $K$. Consequently, we determine, from the on-shell action using standard thermodynamic identities, both the mean and variance of the modular Hamiltonian, finding $\langle K \rangle = \langle (\Delta K)^2 \rangle = \frac{A_{\mathcal{B}}}{4 G_N}$. Finally, we show that modular fluctuations give rise to fluctuations in the geometry, and compute the associated phase shift of massless particles traversing the diamond under such fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the disk solutions which are obtained from the spindle solutions from non-conformal D$p$-branes recently constructed by Boisvert and Ferrero. Then we study the global geometry of the disk solutions. We discover several common features of disk solutions, $e.g.$, monopoles and smeared branes, in most cases, but there are also exceptions.</description>

      <title>From confinement to chaos in AdS/CFT correspondence via non-equilibrium local states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to operator quenches for free fields in AdS. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff, creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators the fluctuations approach quite close those of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Finally, we extend our analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and its hard wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar behavior.</description>

      <title>Three-loop banana integrals with four unequal masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a system of canonical differential equations satisfied by the three-loop banana integrals with four distinct non-zero masses in $D = 2-2\eps$ dimensions. Together with the initial condition in the small-mass limit, this provides all the ingredients to find analytic results for three-loop banana integrals in terms of iterated integrals to any desired order in the dimensional regulator. To obtain this result, we rely on recent advances in understanding the K3 geometry underlying these integrals and in how to construct rotations to an $\eps$-factorized basis. This rotation typically involves the introduction of objects defined as integrals of (derivatives of) K3 periods and rational functions. We apply and extend a method based on results from twisted cohomology to identify relations among these functions, which allows us to reduce their number considerably. We expect that the methods that we have applied here will prove useful to compute further multiloop multiscale Feynman integrals attached to non-trivial geometries.</description>

      <title>Nil-Equivariant Tropological Sigma Models on Filtered Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of tropological (tropical topological) sigma models on higher dimensional target spaces and show that higher dimensional spaces explicitly admit nested Maslov dequantizations which lead to nontrivial anisotropic filtration structures. We provide a classification of all inequivalent tropological sigma models that can be constructed for the case of 4D targets and show that, generically, the corresponding sigma-models are not defined on foliated geometries like in the 2D case but instead are defined on filtered manifolds. We find that the nontrivial filtration structures lead to enhanced global symmetries characterized by noncompact nilpotent Lie algebras given by the 4 dimensional step 3 Engel algebra on the space of fields. We provide a Nilmanifold lattice regularization of the noncompact symmetry group and use this Nilmanifold symmetry to construct a natural equivariant extension of the tropological sigma model. We conjecture that these equivariant tropological sigma models are associated with a new version of GW invariants on filtered manifolds known as \textit{filtered Gromov Witten invariants</description>

      <title>On the reggeon model with the pomeron and odderon: singularities with non-zero masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in the non-trivial transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied. The singuarities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase transition are found in the vicinity of five fixed points found in the previous publication. Since new phases violate the projectile-target symmetry the model is found non-physical for the bare intercepts above their critical value.</description>

      <title>Path integral analysis of Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problems in the complex plane: Establishing the relation between instantons and resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problems are ubiquitous in theoretical physics, with quantum-mechanical applications typically confined to cases for which the eigenfunctions are required to be normalizable on the real axis. However, seeking the spectrum of resonant states for metastable potentials or comprehending $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric scenarios requires the broader study of eigenvalue problems for which the boundary conditions are provided in specific angular sectors of the complex plane. We generalize the conventional path integral treatment to such nonstandard boundary value problems, allowing the extraction of spectral information using functional methods. We find that the arising functional integrals are naturally defined on a complexified integration contour, encapsulating the demanded sectorial boundary conditions of the associated eigenvalue problem. The attained results are applied to the analysis of resonant ground-state energies, through which we identify the previously elusive one-to-one correspondence between decay rates derived from real-time quantum tunneling dynamics and those obtained via the Euclidean instanton method.</description>

      <title>High-order QED correction impacts on phase transition of the Euler-Heisenberg dS spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that AdS black holes possess the basic characteristics of a standard thermodynamic system. Concurrently, the thermodynamic properties of spacetimes featuring multiple horizons with distinct radiation temperatures have also attracted research interest. In this work, considering the high-order quantum electrodynamics (QED) correction, we initially establish an equivalent thermodynamic system for the coexistence region of black hole and cosmological horizons. On this basis, we conduct a detailed investigation into the thermodynamic properties of this dual-horizon coexistence region. Our results demonstrate that this equivalent thermodynamic system exhibits van der Waals-like thermodynamic behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a nonlinear parameter $\gamma$ to analyze its impact on phase transitions within the equivalent thermodynamic system. Under specific conditions, the system undergoes first- or second-order phase transitions for $\gamma=0$, and zeroth- or second-order phase transitions for $\gamma\neq0$. Finally, by utilizing the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy within the thermodynamic topological framework for black holes, we extend this methodology to investigate the topological properties of de Sitter (dS) spacetime. We compute the topological number characterizing the coexistence region of dual horizons in Euler-Heisenberg (EH) dS spacetime using equivalent thermodynamic state parameters. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the nonlinear parameter $\gamma$ on the thermodynamic characteristics of the equivalent system.</description>

      <title>Inflation models selected by the swampland distance conjecture with the Lyth bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models, independent of empirical data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Kaluza-Klein monopole solutions with scalar hair provied by a massive complex scalar field multiplet that minimally couples to five-dimensional Einstein gravity. Writing the scalar field multiplet in terms of the Wigner D-matrices, we introduce the ansatz of the scalar multiplet compatible with the symmetries of the Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole, on which the scalar hair grows. We give the ansatz for a multiplet with arbitrary number of components, whereas we show numerical solutions of the hairy Kaluza-Klein monopole specifically for the cases of scalar triplet and quadruplet. These generaize the preceding study on a doublet \cite{Brihaye:2023vox}. We find that the range of the mass and angular momentum of the hairy solutions are larger for higher multiplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for deriving on-shell recursion relations, with a specific focus on biadjoint and pure Yang-Mills theories. Starting from the double-cover CHY factorization formulae, we identify a suitable set of independent kinematic variables that enables the reconstruction of amputated currents from amplitudes. As a byproduct, this new recursive structure recasts the BCJ numerators into an explicitly on-shell factorized form.</description>

This integral is associated to a family of K3 surfaces, thus representing an example for Feynman integrals with geometries beyond elliptic curves. We evaluate the integral by deriving an $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation, for which we rely on the algorithm presented in a recent publication. Equipping the space of differential forms in Baikov representation by a set of filtrations inspired by Hodge theory, we first obtain a differential equation with entries as Laurent polynomials in $\varepsilon$. Via a sequence of basis rotations we then remove any non-$\varepsilon$-factorising terms. This procedure is algorithmic and at no point relies on prior knowledge of the underlying geometry.</description>

Abstract: I give an account of the discovery of supergravity and the first six years of its development which lead to the most general coupling of supergravity to matter. I restrict the discussion to theories with only one supersymmetry that are in four dimensions. As well as describing the contents of the papers I will also discuss the ideas and techniques they used. I begin by giving an account of the discovery of supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Universal Time Evolution of Holographic and Quantum Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic complexity, as the bulk dual of quantum complexity, encodes the geometric structure of black hole interiors. Motivated by the complexity=anything proposal, we introduce the spectral representation for generating functions associated with codimension-one and codimension-zero holographic complexity measures. These generating functions exhibit a universal slope-ramp-plateau structure, analogous to the spectral form factor in chaotic quantum systems. In such systems, quantum complexity evolves universally, displaying long-time linear growth followed by saturation at late times. By employing the generating function formalism, we demonstrate that this universal behavior originates from random matrix universality in spectral statistics and from a particular pole structure of the matrix elements of the generating functions in the energy eigenbasis. Using the residue theorem, we prove that the existence of this pole structure is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the linear growth of complexity measures. Furthermore, we show that the late-time saturation plateau arises directly from the spectral level repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the concept of Krylov complexity to include general unitary evolutions involving multiple generators. This generalization enables us to formulate a framework for generalized Krylov complexity, which serves as a measure of the complexity of states associated with continuous symmetries within a model. Furthermore, we investigate scenarios where different directions of transformation lead to varying degrees of complexity, which can be compared to geometric approaches to understanding complexity, such as Nielsen complexity. In this context, we introduce a generalized orthogonalization algorithm and delineate its computational framework, which is structured as a network of orthogonal blocks rather than a simple linear chain. Additionally, we provide explicit evaluations of specific illustrative examples to demonstrate the practical application of this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an exact count of protected states, the superconformal index provides a powerful probe into holography and quantum aspects of gravity, reproducing the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of supersymmetric AdS black holes in the large-$N$ limit. As a step toward understanding quantum black hole microstates, we study the finite-$N$ index of the 3d ADHM quiver gauge theory, a UV description of the 3d $\mathcal N=8$ SCFT dual to M-theory on AdS$_4 \times S^7$. In this note, we analyze both microcanonical and canonical features of the superconformal index. By computing the index to sufficiently high orders, we identify signatures of quantum black hole states in the finite-$N$ spectrum of the ADHM quiver, which align with the leading large-$N$ contribution reflecting the holographic dual black hole entropy. Furthermore, we introduce the complex-$\beta$ phase diagram of the index, which exhibits distinct peaks potentially associated with different gravitational saddles. To enable high-order computations, we employ the factorized index and also examine its Higgs branch Hilbert series limit. Our results demonstrate that the finite-$N$ index encodes rich information about black hole microstates and their quantum gravitational interpretation.</description>

      <title>Graded Unitarity in the SCFT/VOA Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertex algebras that arise from four-dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories inherit a collection of novel structural properties from their four-dimensional ancestors. Crucially, when the parent SCFT is unitary, the corresponding vertex algebra is not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we motivate and define a generalized notion of unitarity for vertex algebras that we call \emph{graded unitarity}, and which captures the consequences of four-dimensional unitarity under this correspondence. We also take the first steps towards a classification program for graded-unitary vertex algebras whose underlying vertex algebras are Virasoro or affine Kac--Moody vertex algebras. Remarkably, under certain natural assumptions about the $\mathfrak{R}$-filtration for these vertex algebras, we show that only the $(2,p)$ central charges for Virasoro VOAs and boundary admissible levels for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Kac--Moody vertex algebras can possibly be compatible with graded unitarity. These are precisely the cases of these vertex algebras that are known to arise from four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Black Holes as Sources of High-Energy Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07037v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \textit{memory burden} effect, the idea that the amount of information stored within a system contributes to its stabilization, is particularly relevant for systems with a large information storage capacity, such as black holes. In these objects, the evaporation process halts, at the latest, once approximately half of the initial mass has been radiated away. As a result, light primordial black holes (PBHs) with mass $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{g}$, which are traditionally assumed to have fully evaporated by the present time, may instead survive and constitute viable dark matter candidates. Ongoing mergers of such PBHs would give rise to ``young'' black holes that resume their evaporation, emitting ultrahigh-energy particles potentially detectable by current experiments. The resulting emission spectrum would be thermal across all Standard Model particle species, offering a clear and distinctive signature. We demonstrate that, if the memory burden effect activates after PBHs have lost around half of their initial mass, current measurements of the neutrino flux at Earth place strong constraints on such dark matter candidates for $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$. This suggests that the memory burden must set in at earlier stages of evaporation. Unlike existing bounds, our results depend solely on the mass of the remnant, and not on model-dependent details of the stabilized phase. We also discuss the potential for refining these constraints through observations of gamma rays, cosmic rays, and gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity, describing a collinear array of an arbitrary number of Kerr black holes inside an expanding bubble of nothing is built, thanks to the inverse scattering technique. Physical properties and thermodynamics of the single Kerr in the bubble are studied. No cosmic strings or struts are present. The binary black hole system displays equilibrium configurations, because the expanding bubble surrounding the black holes balances the mutual gravitational attraction of the two constituents.</description>

Abstract: The particle creation via quantum tunneling was recently calculated for the Schwarzschild non-commutative black hole solution in Ref. [Phys. Lett. B 848 (2024) 138335, e-Print: 2310.02445 [gr-qc]]. Nevertheless, it contains inconsistencies in the calculations that need to be properly corrected. In particular, the event horizon was incorrectly determined in that work, which affected all the subsequent calculations. Moreover, the same issue have been repeated elsewhere by the same authors in Refs. [1-4].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To facilitate a simultaneous treatment of an arbitrary number of colors in representation theory-based descriptions of QCD color structure, we derive an $N$-independent reduction of SU($N$) tensor products. To this end, we label each irreducible representation by a pair of Young diagrams, with parts acting on quarks and antiquarks. By combining this with a column-wise multiplication of Young diagrams, we generalize the Littlewood-Richardson rule for the product of two Young diagrams to the product of two Young diagram pairs, achieving a general-$N$ decomposition.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Love numbers of black holes: theory and gravitational waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e., in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at finite frequency. In this work, we compute the dynamical tidal perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing conservative correction at second-order in frequency, thereby possibly demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. We then assess the impact of these dynamical tidal effects on the gravitational-wave phase, which enter at 8th post-Newtonian order, and express the correction in terms of generic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to be matched to the perturbative result. Despite their conceptual interest, we argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>A Perturbative Approach to Symmetric Mass Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau paradigm has been a powerful framework for understanding phase transitions involving spontaneous symmetry breaking. In contrast, phase transitions between two symmetric phases, where neither phase breaks any symmetry, remain less explored. One intriguing class of such transitions involves "symmetric mass generation" (SMG), where interactions drive a transition from a gapless symmetric phase to a gapped symmetric phase. In this work, we develop a controlled perturbative approach to study a class of such transitions, based on an $\epsilon$-expansion around the critical dimension where the SMG-inducing-interaction becomes marginal. Applying this method to two distinct models, we identify a single-parameter-tuned transition in each case, which we conjecture captures the universal critical behavior of the SMG transition in these models. We compute universal quantities associated with these transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local spin polarization of quarks induced by color-field correlators stemming from the correlation of chromo-Lorentz force and chromo-magnetic polarization or chromo-spin Hall effect in the presence of momentum anisotropy. Such effects can trigger longitudinal polarization from fluctuating color fields in glasma or quark gluon plasma phases with transverse expansion for relativistic heavy ion collisions. Especially, from the glasma effect, the resulting longitudinal polarization spectrum of $\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons has a sinusoidal structure with twice the azimuthal angle relative to the anisotropic direction. An order-of-magnitude estimate of the effect aligns with experimental observations. Our findings highlight the significant role of coherent gluon fields as a novel source for spin polarization phenomena in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of a spherically symmetric spacetime that corresponds to the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. The resulting phase space involves two independent dynamical variables along with their conjugate momenta. We quantize the associated minisuperspace using the affine quantization method, which is particularly suited for systems with positive-definite configuration variables. We then explore whether the quantum effects encoded in this wave function can lead to the avoidance of classical singularities.</description>

Abstract: We shall investigate the inflation for the D-brane model, motivated by the modified gravity $F(\phi,T)$. This gravity has been recently introduced in the literature. The feasibility of the D-brane inflation theory in the $F(\phi,T)$-gravity has been studied in conjunction with the most recent Planck data. We shall analyze the slow-roll inflation in the context of the $F(\phi)T$-gravity, via the D-brane model. Then, we shall calculate the inflation dynamics to obtain the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$'' and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ``$r$''. Besides, we investigate the dynamics of the reheating for this model. Our model accurately covers the left-hand side of the Planck data and the D-brane inflation.</description>

      <title>Squeezed gravitons from superradiant axion fields around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity (GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.</description>

      <title>Holographic Strange Metals for Philosophers and Physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the physics and philosophy of strange metals, which are characterized by unusual electrical and thermal properties that deviate from conventional metallic behaviour. The anomalous strange-metal behaviour discussed here appears in the normal state of a copper-oxide high-temperature superconductor, and it cannot be described using standard condensed-matter physics. Currently, it can only be described through a holographic dual, viz.~a four-dimensional black hole in anti-de Sitter spacetime. This paper first introduces the theory of, and specific experiments carried out on, strange metals. Then it discusses a number of philosophical questions that strange metals open up regarding the experimental evidence for holography and its realist interpretation. Strange metals invert the explanatory arrows, in that usual holographic arguments are seen as giving explanations of the bulk quantum-gravity theory from the boundary. By contrast, the aim here is, by using holography, to explain the experimentally discovered and anomalous properties of strange metals.</description>

      <title>Cheng's eigenvalue comparison on metric measure spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the localization technique, we prove a sharp upper bound on the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of metric balls in essentially non-branching $\mathsf{CD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces. This extends a celebrated result of Cheng to the non-smooth setting of metric measure spaces satisfying Ricci curvature lower bounds in a synthetic sense, via optimal transport. A rigidity statement is also provided for $\mathsf{RCD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces. We then present some mathematical and physical applications: in the former, we obtain an upper bound on the $j^{th}$ Neumann eigenvalue in essentially non-branching $\mathsf{CD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces and a bound on the essential spectrum in non-compact $\mathsf{RCD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces; in the latter, the eigenvalue bounds correspond to general upper bounds on the masses of the spin-2 Kaluza-Klein excitations around general warped compactifications of higher-dimensional theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Applying the Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo method to the Hubbard model away from half filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an efficient and low-cost algorithm for addressing the sign problem. It mitigates the sign problem while avoiding the ergodicity issues that are intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In this study, we apply the WV-HMC method to the Hubbard model away from half filling, which is known to suffer from a severe sign problem. We compute the number density on lattices of spatial size $6 \times 6$ and $8 \times 8$ at inverse temperature $\beta = 6.4$ using $N_t = 20$ Trotter steps. Our results show that the WV-HMC method remains effective even in parameter regions where non-thimble Monte Carlo methods fail due to severe sign problems. In this work, we employ direct solvers for fermion matrix inversion, with a computational cost of $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom and proportional to the spacetime lattice volume. An alternative algorithm employing pseudofermions and iterative solvers, which reduces the cost to $O(N^2)$ at the expense of careful parameter tuning, will be discussed in a separate publication.</description>

      <title>Universal tradeoff relations between resource cost and irreversibility of channels: General-resource Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorems and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies offer exceptional -- sometimes almost magical -- speed and performance, yet every quantum process costs physical resources. Designing next-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following question: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a desired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum resource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the lower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required resource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of resources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others -- yielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel. Its broad scope positions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results: (1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the irreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff for any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to free energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem, which is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a wide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing resourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource cost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in fact require an infinite implementation cost. These findings reveal a universal relationship between quantumness and irreversibility, providing a first step toward a general theory that explains when -- and how -- quantumness can suppress irreversibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the confining pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form.</description>

      <title>God of the Gaps: Random matrix models and the black hole spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that random matrix models are a natural tool for understanding the appearance of a large gap in the microstate spectrum of black holes when there is a high degeneracy of states, in a variety of settings. While the most natural context is extended supersymmetry, where the number of BPS states scales as ${\rm e}^{S_0}$, where $S_0$ is the $T{=}0$ entropy, it is a robust feature that a large gap will appear whenever there is a mechanism producing a high degree of degeneracy. In random matrix model terms, the phenomenon is simply an extreme case of eigenvalue repulsion in the effective log gas description. We exhibit several examples for illustration, starting with the simple Wishart model, continuing with extensions of it that incorporate multicritical behaviour allowing for the emergence of gravity, and culminating in constructing multicritical matrix models of ${N}{=}2$ and ${N}{=}4$ JT supergravity theories, the latter of which is new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyon condensation in wormhole geometries is investigated in the Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) formulation, a proposed reformulation of 3d AdS quantum gravity. We first review some elementary techniques of VTQFT and summarize a gauging scheme for non-invertible symmetries referred to as anyon condensation. We then exhibit that anyon condensation is applicable to VTQFT even though the category of Wilson lines associated with it is not strictly a modular tensor category (MTC) due to the continuously infinite label $p\in\mathbb{R}_+$. More specifically, it is shown that the partition function of the wormhole factorizes upon condensing the so-called diagonal condensable anyon $\mathcal{A}=\int_{0}^{\infty}dp\,L_p\boxtimes\overline{L}_p$ in VTQFT. The resulting $2$d boundary theory is Liouville CFT by symmetry TFT construction, and to our knowledge, this is among the very few explicit computational examples of gauging \textit{continuous non-invertible} symmetries in the literature.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Overlaps in JT Gravity: From Spectral Form Factor to Generating Functions of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between black hole interior dynamics and quantum chaos provides a crucial framework for probing quantum effects in quantum gravity. In this work, we investigate non-perturbative overlaps in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to uncover universal signatures of quantum chaos and quantum complexity. Taking advantage of universal spectral correlators from random matrix theory, we compute the overlaps between the thermofield double (TFD) state and two distinct classes of states: fixed-length states, which encode maximal volume slices, and time-shifted TFD states. The squared overlaps naturally define probability distributions that quantify the expectation values of gravitational observables. Central to our results is the introduction of generating functions for quantum complexity measures, such as $\langle e^{-\alpha \ell} \rangle$. The time evolution of these generating functions exhibits the universal slope-ramp-plateau structure, mirroring the behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF). Using generating functions, we further demonstrate that the universal time evolution of complexity for chaotic systems, which is characterized by a linear growth followed by a late-time plateau, arises from the disappearance of the linear ramp as the regularization parameter $\alpha$ decreases. With regard to the time-shifted TFD state, we derive a surprising result: the expectation value of the time shift, which classically grows linearly, vanishes when non-perturbative quantum corrections are incorporated. This cancellation highlights a fundamental distinction between semiclassical and quantum gravitational descriptions of the black hole interior. All our findings establish generating functions as powerful probes of quantum complexity and chaos in gravitational and quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical understanding of deep learning remains elusive despite its empirical success. In this study, we propose a novel "synaptic field theory" that describes the training dynamics of synaptic weights and biases in the continuum limit. Unlike previous approaches, our framework treats synaptic weights and biases as fields and interprets their indices as spatial coordinates, with the training data acting as external sources. This perspective offers new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of deep learning and suggests a pathway for leveraging well-established field-theoretic techniques to study neural network training.</description>

Abstract: We study the Higgs branch moduli space of certain 6d $(1,0)$ SCFTs after gauging their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Green-Schwarz automorphism. We explain how to read the flavor symmetry of such SCFTs directly from the 6d construction, and we confirm the expectation by computing the Coulomb branch Hilbert series of their $\mathbb{Z}_2$-wreathed 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ magnetic quiver. To perform the latter computation, we explicitly introduce a methodology to determine such Hilbert series for $\mathbb{Z}_2$-wreathed orthosymplectic quivers.</description>

In this setting we show that, to one-loop order and at late time, the norm of the no-boundary state vanishes, going as $e^{S_0} \frac{Z S_0^{-d(d+1)/4}}{\text{vol}(SO(d,1))}$ with $S_0$ the tree-level entropy of the static patch, $d$ the spacetime dimension, and $Z$ non-negative. We show that the presence of an observer stabilizes the norm to a large, positive value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of electromagnetic and gravitational waves off a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the low-temperature regime where the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations. We find that the black hole is transparent to electromagnetic and gravitational radiation of fixed helicity below a certain frequency threshold. This phenomenon arises because the angular momentum of the black hole is quantized, creating an energy gap between the spinless black hole state and the first excited spinning states. Radiation with angular momentum -- such as photons, gravitons, and partial waves of a massless scalar field, which we also study -- must supply enough energy to bridge this gap to be absorbed. Below this threshold, no absorption can occur, rendering the black hole transparent. For frequencies above the gap, the scarcity of black hole states continues to suppress the absorption cross-section relative to semiclassical predictions, making the black hole translucent rather than completely transparent. Notably, electromagnetic absorption is significantly stronger than gravitational absorption, beyond what differences in spin alone would suggest.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions for open XXZ spin 1/2 quantum chains with unparallel boundary magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue our derivation of the correlation functions of open quantum spin 1/2 chains with unparallel magnetic fields on the edges; this time for the more involved case of the XXZ spin 1/2 chains. We develop our study in the framework of the quantum Separation of Variables (SoV), which gives us both the complete spectrum characterization and simple scalar product formulae for separate states, including transfer matrix eigenstates. Here, we leave the boundary magnetic field in the first site of the chain completely arbitrary, and we fix the boundary field in the last site $N$ of the chain to be a specific value along the $z$-direction. This is a natural first choice for the unparallel boundary magnetic fields. We prove that under these special boundary conditions, on the one side, we have a simple enough complete spectrum description in terms of homogeneous Baxter like $TQ$-equation. On the other side, we prove a simple enough description of the action of a basis of local operators on transfer matrix eigenstates as linear combinations of separate states. Thanks to these results, we achieve our main goal to derive correlation functions for a set of local operators both for the finite and half-infinite chains, with multiple integral formulae in this last case.</description>

      <title>On correlation functions for the open XXZ chain with non-longitudinal boundary fields : the case with a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of [1], in which a set of matrix elements of local operators was computed for the XXZ spin-1/2 open chain with a particular case of unparallel boundary fields. Here, we extend these results to the more general case in which both fields are non-longitudinal and related by one constraint, allowing for a partial description of the spectrum by usual Bethe equations. More precisely, the complete spectrum and eigenstates can be characterized within the Separation of Variables (SoV) framework. One uses here the fact that, under the constraint, a part of this SoV spectrum can be described via solutions of a usual, homogeneous, TQ-equation, with corresponding transfer matrix eigenstates coinciding with generalized Bethe states. We explain how to generically compute the action of a basis of local operators on such kind of states, and this under the most general boundary condition on the last site of the chain. As a result, we can compute the matrix elements of some of these basis elements in any eigenstate described by the homogenous TQ-equation. Assuming, following a conjecture of Nepomechie and Ravanini, that the ground state itself can be described in this framework, we obtain multiple integral representations for these matrix elements in the half-infinite chain limit, generalizing those previously obtained in the case of longitudinal boundary fields and in the case of the special boundary conditions considered in [1].</description>

      <title>The Riemannian curvature identities of a $G_2$ connection with skew-symmetric torsion and generalized Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05619v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curvature properties of the characteristic connection on an integrable $G_2$ manifold are investigated. We consider integrable $G_2$ manifold of constant type, i.e. the scalar product of the exterior derivative of the $G_2$ form with its Hodge dual is a constant. We show that on an integrable $G_2$ manifold of constant type with $G_2$-instanton characteristic curvature and vanishing Ricci tensor the torsion 3-form is harmonic. Consequently, we prove that the characteristic curvature is symmetric in exchange the first and the second pair and Ricci flat if and only if the three-form torsion is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita and to the characteristic connection simultaneously and this is equivalent to the condition that the characteristic curvature satisfies the Riemannian first Bianchi identity. We find that the Hull connection is a $G_2$-instanton exactly when the torsion is closed. We observe that any compact integrable $G_2$ manifold with closed torsion is a generalized gradient Ricci soliton and this is equivalent to a certain vector field to be parallel with respect to the characteristic connection. In particular, this vector field is an infinitesimal automorphism of the $G_2$ structure and preserves the torsion three form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06438v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that on compact $Spin(7)$--manifold with exterior derivative of the Lee form lying in the Lie algebra $spin(7)$ the curvature $R$ of the $Spin(7)$--torsion connection $R\in S^2\Lambda^2$ with vanishing Ricci tensor if and only if the $3$-form torsion is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection. It is also proved that $R$ satisfies the Riemannian first Bianchi identity exactly when the $3$-form torsion is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita and to the $Spin(7)$--torsion connections simultaneously.
  Precise conditions for a compact $Spin(7)$--manifold to has closed torsion are given in terms of the Ricci tensor of the $Spin(7)$--torsion connection. It is shown that a compact $Spin(7)$--manifold with closed torsion is Ricci flat if and only if either the norm of the torsion or the Riemannian scalar curvature is constant. It is proved that any compact $Spin(7)$--manifold with closed torsion 3-form is a generalized gradient Ricci soliton and this is equivalent to a certain vector field to be parallel with respect to the torsion connection. In particular, this vector field preserves the $Spin(7)$--structure.</description>

      <title>Two-Parameter Quantum Groups and $R$-Matrices: Classical Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct finite $R$-matrices for the first fundamental representation $V$ of two-parameter quantum groups $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$, both through the decomposition of $V\otimes V$ into irreducibles $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$-submodules as well as by evaluating the universal $R$-matrix. The latter is crucially based on the construction of dual PBW-type bases of $U^{\pm}_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ consisting of the ordered products of quantum root vectors defined via $(r,s)$-bracketings and combinatorics of standard Lyndon words. We further derive explicit formulas for affine $R$-matrices, both through the Yang-Baxterization technique of [Internat. J. Modern Phys. A 6 (1991), 3735-3779] and as the unique intertwiner between the tensor product of $V(u)$ and $V(v)$, viewed as modules over two-parameter quantum affine algebras $U_{r,s}(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$. The latter generalizes the formulas of [Comm. Math. Phys. 102 (1986), 537-547] for one-parametric quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>Flatness of $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and commutativity of Frobenius algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor functor called $\alpha$-induction produces a new unitary fusion category from a Frobenius algebra, or a $Q$-system, in a braided unitary fusion category. A bi-unitary connection, which is a finite family of complex number subject to some axioms, realizes an object in any unitary fusion category. It also gives a characterization of a finite-dimensional nondegenerate commuting square in subfactor theory of Jones and realizes a certain $4$-tensor appearing in recent studies of $2$-dimensional topological order. We study $\alpha$-induction for bi-unitary connections, and show that flatness of the resulting $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections implies commutativity of the original Frobenius algebra. This gives a converse of our previous result and answers a question raised by R. Longo. We furthermore give finer correspondence between the flat parts of the $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and the commutative Frobenius subalgebras studied by B\"ockenhauer-Evans.</description>

      <title>Gravitization Equation and Zero Energy Momentum Tensor Theorem with Cancellation Law in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the essential properties of gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT) based on spin gauge symmetry, using the general theory of quantum electrodynamics as an example. A constraint equation for the field strength of the gravigauge field is derived, serving as a gravitization equation within the spin-related gravigauge spacetime. This equation reveals how gravitational effects emerge from the non-commutative relation of the gravigauge derivative operator. By transmuting the action from gravigauge spacetime to Minkowski spacetime, we demonstrate that translational invariance results in a vanishing energy-momentum tensor in GQFT when the equations of motion are applied to all fundamental fields, including the gravigauge field. This extends the conservation law of the energy-momentum tensor in quantum field theory to a cancellation law of the energy-momentum tensor in GQFT. As a result, an equivalence between the general gravitational equation and the zero energy-momentum tensor theorem naturally arises in GQFT. Certain aspects of the Poincar\'e gauge theory are also briefly discussed. Furthermore, a GQFT incorporating the Chern-Simons action in three-dimensional spacetime is developed, based on the inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry WS(1,2) and the global Poincar\'e symmetry PO(1,2). This framework provides a basis for exploring its connection to Witten's perspective on three-dimensional gravity.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Heavy Quarks in Strongly Coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the probability distribution $P({\bf k})$ for a heavy quark with velocity $v$ propagating through strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma in the 't Hooft limit at a temperature $T$ to acquire a momentum ${\bf k}$ due to interactions with the plasma. This distribution encodes the well-known drag coefficient $\eta_D$ and the transverse and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_L$. Furthermore, our calculation determines all of the higher order and mixed moments to leading order in $1/\sqrt{\lambda}$ for the first time. These non-Gaussian features of $P({\bf k})$ include qualitatively novel correlations between longitudinal energy loss and transverse momentum broadening at nonzero $v$. We demonstrate that these non-Gaussian characteristics can be sizable in magnitude and even dominant in physically relevant situations. We use these results to derive a Kolmogorov equation for the evolution of the probability distribution for the total momentum of a heavy quark that propagates through strongly coupled plasma. This evolution equation accounts for all higher order correlations between transverse momentum broadening and longitudinal energy loss, which we have calculated from first principles. It reduces to a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation when truncated to only include the effects of $\eta_D$, $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_L$. Remarkably, while heavy quarks do not reach kinetic equilibrium with the plasma if evolved with this FP equation, we demonstrate that heavy quarks do reach kinetic equilibrium if evolved with the all-order Kolmogorov equation we have derived. Our results thus provide a dynamically complete framework for understanding the thermalization of a heavy quark that may be initially far from equilibrium in the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma -- as well as new insight into heavy quark transport and equilibration in quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several inequalities between the curvature invariants, which impose constraints on curvature singularities. Some of the inequalities hold for a family of spacetimes which include static, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker, and Bianchi type I metrics, independently of whether they are solutions of some particular field equations. In contrast, others hold for solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equation and a family of energy-momentum tensors (featuring ideal fluids, scalar fields and nonlinear electromagnetic fields), independently of the specific form of the spacetime metric. We illustrate different behaviour of the basic curvature invariants with numerous examples and discuss the consequences and limitations of the proven results.</description>

      <title>Properties of solutions by the Schwinger-Dyson equation at finite temperature and density : A four-fermion interaction model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the properties of the solutions obtained by the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE).
  As a simple example, we consider a two-dimensional model including four-fermion interaction. It is shown that when this model is solved by an iterative method using the SDE at finite density, multiple solutions depending on the initial input values are obtained.
  We investigate the reasons for this situation by examining the convergence of the solutions obtained by iterative method. We also consider the solution of the SDE using alternative methods. Furthermore, we compare these results with analytical solutions at zero temperature and discuss the relation with the behavior of the effective potential. We extend these considerations to finite temperatures.
  Based on these analyses, we consider ways to avoid spurious solutions that appear in the iterative method.</description>

      <title>Conformal Phase Transition in Supersymmetric QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional supersymmetric QCD in conformal window with a marginally relevant deformation which triggers the spontaneous breaking of (approximate) scale invariance and the subsequent confinement, generating a mass gap, at an energy scale hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale without fine-tuning. We analyze the finite temperature system and show that the phase transition associated with the breaking of conformal invariance is of the strong first order. When such a phase transition takes place at a temperature of the Universe around the electroweak scale, it generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background probed by future space-based interferometers, while a conformal phase transition in a dark sector at $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV generates GWs to explain the reported pulsar timing array signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we construct a formalism that can reveal the general characteristics of classes of viable $F(R)$ inflationary theories. The assumptions we make is that the slow-roll era occurs, and that the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$ of the $F(R)$ gravity is positive or zero, for both the inflationary and late-time quasi de Sitter eras, a necessary condition for the stability of the de Sitter spacetime. In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m_s^2=\frac{\kappa^2 \rho_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\rho_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\Lambda,m_s^2)$. Using these general assumptions we provide the general features of viable classes of $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theories which remarkably can also simultaneously describe successfully the dark energy era. This unique feature of a unified description of the dark energy and inflationary eras stems from the requirement of the monotonicity of the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$. These viable classes are either deformations of the $R^2$ model or $\alpha$-attractors type theories. The analysis of the viability of a general $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theory is reduced in evaluating the parameter $x=\frac{R F_{RRR}}{F_{RR}}$ and the first slow-roll index of the theory, either numerically or approximately. We also disentangle the power-law $F(R)$ gravities from power-law evolution.</description>

      <title>Schott term in the binding energy for compact binaries on circular orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phasing for compact binary systems on circular orbits was obtained in arXiv:2304.11185 at fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order thanks to two main ingredients: the 4PN conservative energy (associated to a nonradiative spacetime) in terms of the orbital frequency and the 4.5PN flux in terms of the waveform frequency (i.e., the half-frequency of the $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ mode). When obtaining the phasing, a key physical postulate was made: the expression of the binding energy in terms of the waveform frequency was assumed to be identical to the expression of the conservative energy in terms of the orbital frequency. This postulate was necessary to ensure that the frequency evolution obtained through the flux-balance law (which involves the binding energy) was independent of the choice of spacetime foliation. In this work, I show that the binding energy entering the flux-balance law differs from the 4PN conservative energy by a 4PN pseudo-Schott term, associated with radiation-reaction effects due to gravitational tails. Unlike the usual Schott terms (at 2.5PN, 3.5PN and 4.5PN), the pseudo-Schott term is not a total derivative and is in fact hereditary, so it does not vanish for circular orbits. Remarkably, the binding energy thus obtained is in perfect agreement with the one obtained using the aforementioned physical postulate, which confirms that the 4.5PN phasing associated to the waveform frequency computed in arXiv:2304.11185 is indeed correct. This result is extended to the other Poincar\'e invariants, and `thermodynamic' relations between the binding energy and angular momentum are established. Finally, the chirp and phasing associated to the orbital frequency are presented at 4.5PN, including horizon-absorption effects.</description>

      <title>Affine connections for Galilean and Carrollian structures: a unified perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a classification of general Carrollian structures, permitting affine connections with both torsion and non-metricity. We compare with a recent classification of general Galilean structures in order to present a unified perspective on both. Moreover, we demonstrate how both sets of structures emerge from the most general possible Lorentzian structures in their respective limits, and we highlight the role of global hyperbolicity in constraining both structures. We then leverage this work in order to construct for the first time an ultra-relativistic geometric trinity of gravitational theories, and consider connections which are simultaneously compatible with Galilean and Carrollian structures. We close by outlining a number of open questions and future prospects.</description>

      <title>GW170817 Viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation Compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate several Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models that are compatible with the GW170817 event, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the BICEP/Keck updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We consider two distinct classes of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories, which are equally successful for GW170817-compatible model building and we examine their viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The two models are distinct since the first class relates directly the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function with the scalar potential and yields $c_T^2=1$ while in the second class, the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function and the scalar potential are freely but conveniently chosen and the class of models respects the constraint $\left| c_T^2 - 1 \right| &lt; 6 \times 10^{-15}$. We provide several examples of models belonging to both the two classes of GW170817-compatible Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories and we demonstrate that Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories provide a promising theoretical framework for inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scalar tidal response of static and rotating black holes in anti-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal response of both static and rotating black holes in anti de-Sitter spacetime. We perform the neutral scalar field perturbation for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. On the other hand, charged scalar field are used for perturbing Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman black holes. We find that the tidal Love number for all black holes are always nonvanishing due to the presence of cosmological constant. In contrast, tidal dissipation can vanish for certain conditions depending on the scalar field's frequency and the black hole's parameters.</description>
