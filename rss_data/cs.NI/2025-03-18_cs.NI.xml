      <title>End-to-End Edge AI Service Provisioning Framework in 6G ORAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of 6G, Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architectures are evolving to support intelligent, adaptive, and automated network orchestration. This paper proposes a novel Edge AI and Network Service Orchestration framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents deployed as O-RAN rApps. The proposed LLM-agent-powered system enables interactive and intuitive orchestration by translating the user's use case description into deployable AI services and corresponding network configurations. The LLM agent automates multiple tasks, including AI model selection from repositories (e.g., Hugging Face), service deployment, network adaptation, and real-time monitoring via xApps. We implement a prototype using open-source O-RAN projects (OpenAirInterface and FlexRIC) to demonstrate the feasibility and functionality of our framework. Our demonstration showcases the end-to-end flow of AI service orchestration, from user interaction to network adaptation, ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) compliance. This work highlights the potential of integrating LLM-driven automation into 6G O-RAN ecosystems, paving the way for more accessible and efficient edge AI ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Evolutionary Optimization with Predictive Modeling for Stable Delay-Constrained Routing in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a cornerstone of intelligent transportation systems, facilitating real-time communication between vehicles and infrastructure. However, the dynamic nature of VANETs introduces significant challenges in routing, especially in minimizing communication delay while ensuring route stability. This paper proposes a hierarchical evolutionary optimization framework for delay-constrained routing in vehicular networks. Leveraging multi-objective optimization, the framework balances delay and stability objectives and incorporates adaptive mechanisms like incremental route adjustments and LSTM-based predictive modeling. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework maintains low delay and high stability, adapting effectively to frequent topology changes in dynamic vehicular environments.</description>

      <title>Open Wireless Digital Twin: End-to-End 5G Mobility Emulation in O-RAN Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end wireless digital twin platform constructed using open-source software and open data to enhance the evaluation of mobile communication systems. The proposed open wireless digital twin (OWDT) integrates OpenAirInterface (OAI) for 5G NR protocol stack emulation and NVIDIA Sionna RT for high-resolution ray tracing based radio propagation modeling. This integration enables realistic emulation of vehicular mobility scenarios, leveraging real-world geographic and building data to bridge the gap between theoretical simulations and real-world deployments. The platform utilizes O-RAN's Near-RT RIC via OAI FlexRIC to dynamically monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as RSRP, MCS, BLER, and throughput in real time. Through extensive evaluation in urban environments, this study demonstrates the validity of the emulation framework, revealing its capability to replicate real-world communication dynamics with high fidelity. The results underscore the potential of OWDT in accelerating wireless system development, reducing experimental costs, and optimizing network configurations.</description>

      <title>MODRIC: A Cost Effective MODular Data Center Network Architecture with Rich InterConnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shipping container based modular architectures provide design flexibility in data centers with building blocks to expand the network as and when needed. In this paper, high capacity Modular Data Center (MDC) network architecture with Rich Inter Connections named MODRIC is proposed. MODRIC is a cost-effective switch-centric network design which allows building a flexible MDC network with commodity switches. It uses an inter-container connectivity similar to the structure of generalized hypercube in order to provide high inter-container bandwidth. Further, a hybrid Clos topology is used to build the container network. MODRIC is highly suitable for cost effectively building mega data centers requiring high throughput capacity and resilience against failures. This paper presents the proposed architecture, discusses its relevant properties, and proposes suitable addressing, routing and network construction schemes. The paper also presents comparative studies on its cost and performance with existing network topologies.</description>

      <title>Agentic Search Engine for Real-Time IoT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled diverse devices to communicate over the Internet, yet the fragmentation of IoT systems limits seamless data sharing and coordinated management. We have recently introduced SensorsConnect, a unified framework to enable seamless content and sensor data sharing in collaborative IoT systems, inspired by how the World Wide Web (WWW) enabled a shared and accessible space for information among humans. This paper presents the IoT Agentic Search Engine (IoT-ASE), a real-time search engine tailored for IoT environments. IoT-ASE leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to address the challenge of searching vast, real-time IoT data, enabling it to handle complex queries and deliver accurate, contextually relevant results. We implemented a use-case scenario in Toronto to demonstrate how IoT-ASE can improve service quality recommendations by leveraging real-time IoT data. Our evaluation shows that IoT-ASE achieves a 92\% accuracy in retrieving intent-based services and produces responses that are concise, relevant, and context-aware, outperforming generalized responses from systems like Gemini. These findings highlight the potential IoT-ASE to make real-time IoT data accessible and support effective, real-time decision-making.</description>

      <title>Mentor-Telemachus Bond: Transferring Knowledge in Semantic Communication via Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoder, decoder and knowledge base are three major components for semantic communication. Recent advances have achieved significant progress in the encoder-decoder design. However, there remains a considerable gap in the construction and utilization of knowledge base, which plays important roles in establishing consensus among communication participants through knowledge transferring and sharing. Current knowledge base designs typically involve complex structures, which lead to significant computational overheads and heavy reliance on manually annotated datasets, making it difficult to adapt to existing encoder-decoder models. Hence, without knowledge transferring and sharing within the network results in poor generalization of encoder-decoder. This necessitates model training for specific tasks and datasets, significantly limiting the scalability of semantic communication systems to larger networks. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Contrastive Representations Learning based Semantic Communication Framework (CRLSC). In CRLSC, the server-side pre-trained large model utilizes large-scale public datasets to construct shared knowledge base. Local-side encoders in terminal devices conduct training guided by shared knowledge base. These trained encoders can then build private knowledge bases from private datasets and fine-tune decoders for specific tasks. This simple and effective approach can facilitate the knowledge transferring across large-scale heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>SafeSlice: Enabling SLA-Compliant O-RAN Slicing via Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based slicing policies have shown significant success in simulated environments but face challenges in physical systems such as open radio access networks (O-RANs) due to simulation-to-reality gaps. These policies often lack safety guarantees to ensure compliance with service level agreements (SLAs), such as the strict latency requirements of immersive applications. As a result, a deployed DRL slicing agent may make resource allocation (RA) decisions that degrade system performance, particularly in previously unseen scenarios. Real-world immersive applications require maintaining SLA constraints throughout deployment to prevent risky DRL exploration. In this paper, we propose SafeSlice to address both the cumulative (trajectory-wise) and instantaneous (state-wise) latency constraints of O-RAN slices. We incorporate the cumulative constraints by designing a sigmoid-based risk-sensitive reward function that reflects the slices' latency requirements. Moreover, we build a supervised learning cost model as part of a safety layer that projects the slicing agent's RA actions to the nearest safe actions, fulfilling instantaneous constraints. We conduct an exhaustive experiment that supports multiple services, including real virtual reality (VR) gaming traffic, to investigate the performance of SafeSlice under extreme and changing deployment conditions. SafeSlice achieves reductions of up to 83.23% in average cumulative latency, 93.24% in instantaneous latency violations, and 22.13% in resource consumption compared to the baselines. The results also indicate SafeSlice's robustness to changing the threshold configurations of latency constraints, a vital deployment scenario that will be realized by the O-RAN paradigm to empower mobile network operators (MNOs).</description>

      <title>A Reference Architecture for Autonomous Networks: An Agent-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12871v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vision of autonomous systems is becoming increasingly important in many application areas, where the aim is to replace humans with agents. These include autonomous vehicles and other agents' applications in business processes and problem-solving. For networks, the increasing scale and operation and management (O&amp;M) complexity drive the need for autonomous networks (AN). The technical objective of AN is to ensure trustworthy O&amp;M without human intervention for higher efficiency and lower operating costs. However, realizing AN seems more difficult than autonomous vehicles. It encounters challenges of networks' structural and functional complexity, which operate as distributed dynamic systems governed by various technical and economic constraints. A key problem lies in formulating a rigorous development methodology that facilitates a seamless transition from traditional networks to AN. Central to this methodology is the definition of a reference architecture for network agents, which specifies the required functionalities for their realization, regardless of implementation choices. This article proposes a reference architecture characterizing main functional features, illustrating its application with network use cases. It shows how artificial intelligence components can be used to implement the required functionality and its coordination. The latter is achieved through the management and generation of shared domain-specific knowledge stored in long-term memory, ensuring the overall consistency of decisions and their execution. The article concludes with a discussion of architecture specialization for building network layer agents. It also identifies the main technical challenges ahead, such as satisfying essential requirements at development or runtime, as well as the issue of coordinating agents to achieve collective intelligence in meeting overall network goals.</description>

      <title>Enable Time-Sensitive Applications in Kubernetes with Container Network Interface Plugin Agnostic Metadata Proxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application deployment in cloud environment is dominated by Kubernetes-orchestrated microservices. Provides a secure environment, networking, storage, isolation, scheduling, and many other abstractions that can be easily extended to meet our needs. Time-Sensitive Applications (TSAs) have special requirements for compute and network. Deploying TSAs in Kubernetes is challenging because the networking implemented by Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins is not aware of the traffic characteristic required by Time-Sensitive Network. Even if a network interface supports TSN features (e.g.: Scheduled Traffic) and a modified CNI plugin is aware of this interface, the pod network isolation built on top of Linux deletes the metadata required for TSN protocols to work with.
  We propose TSN metadata proxy, a simple architecture that allows any TSA microservice to use the TSN capabilities of the physical NIC, without any modification. This architecture is tightly integrated with the Kubernetes networking model, works with popular CNI plugins, and supports services such as ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer without additional configuration. Unlike former proposals, this architecture does not require either bypassing the Linux kernel network stack, direct access to the physical NIC, escalated privileges for the TSA microservice, or even modification of the TSA.</description>

      <title>Toward Generative 6G Simulation: An Experimental Multi-Agent LLM and ns-3 Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The move toward open Sixth-Generation (6G) networks necessitates a novel approach to full-stack simulation environments for evaluating complex technology developments before prototyping and real-world implementation. This paper introduces an innovative approach\footnote{A lightweight, mock version of the code is available on GitHub at that combines a multi-agent framework with the Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to automate and optimize the generation, debugging, execution, and analysis of complex 5G network scenarios. Our framework orchestrates a suite of specialized agents -- namely, the Simulation Generation Agent, Test Designer Agent, Test Executor Agent, and Result Interpretation Agent -- using advanced LangChain coordination. The Simulation Generation Agent employs a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process, leveraging LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to translate natural language simulation specifications into precise ns-3 scripts. Concurrently, the Test Designer Agent generates comprehensive automated test suites by integrating knowledge retrieval techniques with dynamic test case synthesis. The Test Executor Agent dynamically deploys and runs simulations, managing dependencies and parsing detailed performance metrics. At the same time, the Result Interpretation Agent utilizes LLM-driven analysis to extract actionable insights from the simulation outputs. By integrating external resources such as library documentation and ns-3 testing frameworks, our experimental approach can enhance simulation accuracy and adaptability, reducing reliance on extensive programming expertise. A detailed case study using the ns-3 5G-LENA module validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The code generation process converges in an average of 1.8 iterations, has a syntax error rate of 17.0%, a mean response time of 7.3 seconds, and receives a human evaluation score of 7.5.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Resiliency of Sketch-based Security via LSB Sharing-based Dynamic Late Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the exponentially growing Internet traffic, sketch data structure with a probabilistic algorithm has been expected to be an alternative solution for non-compromised (non-selective) security monitoring. While facilitating counting within a confined memory space, the sketch's memory efficiency and accuracy were further pushed to their limit through finer-grained and dynamic control of constrained memory space to adapt to the data stream's inherent skewness (i.e., Zipf distribution), namely small counters with extensions. In this paper, we unveil a vulnerable factor of the small counter design by introducing a new sketch-oriented attack, which threatens a stream of state-of-the-art sketches and their security applications. With the root cause analyses, we propose Siamese Counter with enhanced adversarial resiliency and verified feasibility with extensive experimental and theoretical analyses. Under a sketch pollution attack, Siamese Counter delivers 47% accurate results than a state-of-the-art scheme, and demonstrates up to 82% more accurate estimation under normal measurement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Decentralized Federated Learning Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of smartphones and smart wearable devices has led to the widespread use of Centralized Federated Learning (CFL) for training powerful machine learning models while preserving data privacy. However, CFL faces limitations due to its overreliance on a central server, which impacts latency and system robustness. Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is introduced to address these challenges. It facilitates direct collaboration among participating devices without relying on a central server. Each device can independently connect with other devices and share model parameters. This work explores crucial factors influencing the convergence and generalization capacity of DFL models, emphasizing network topologies, non-IID data distribution, and training strategies. We first derive the convergence rate of different DFL model deployment strategies. Then, we comprehensively analyze various network topologies (e.g., linear, ring, star, and mesh) with different degrees of non-IID data and evaluate them over widely adopted machine learning models (e.g., classical, deep neural networks, and Large Language Models) and real-world datasets. The results reveal that models converge to the optimal one for IID data. However, the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the degree of non-IID data distribution. Our findings will serve as valuable guidelines for designing effective DFL model deployments in practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Modular Quantum Network Architecture for Integrating Network Scheduling with Local Program Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for scheduling network operations enabling the end-to-end generation of entanglement according to user demand. The main challenge solved by this architecture is to allow for the integration of a network schedule with the execution of quantum programs running on processing end nodes in order to realise quantum network applications. A key element of this architecture is the definition of an entanglement packet to meet application requirements on near-term quantum networks where the lifetimes of the qubits stored at the end nodes are limited. Our architecture is fully modular and hardware agnostic, and defines a framework for further research on specific components that can now be developed independently of each other. In order to evaluate our architecture, we realise a proof of concept implementation on a simulated 6-node network in a star topology. We show our architecture facilitates the execution of quantum network applications, and that robust admission control is required to maintain quality of service. Finally, we comment on potential bottlenecks in our architecture and provide suggestions for future improvements.</description>

Abstract: As the demand for 6G technologies continues to grow, the radio access infrastructure is expected to become increasingly dense. Cell-free (CF) Massive MIMO systems provide remarkable flexibility by enabling coherent service to users through multiple Access Points (APs). This innovative paradigm necessitates precise and stable phase synchronization. This paper examines the standardized 5G New Radio (NR) framework, focusing on subcarrier spacing, OFDM symbol duration, and allocation, while investigating the impact of Phase Noise (PN) on the performance of scalable massive MIMO cell-free systems. Unlike existing studies that typically employ a simplified model of a free-running oscillator characterized by a Wiener process, we present a realistic phase noise model inspired by actual hardware, designed to accurately capture the Local Oscillator (LO) phase drift. Furthermore, our PN model extends its applicability beyond cell-free systems, making it relevant for any RF system operating within the sub-6 GHz band. This model provides a robust foundation for the practical design of cell-free systems, encompassing numerology and pilot allocation strategies. Our findings reveal that even cost-effective low-cost Local Oscillators can achieve sufficient stability, resulting in negligible degradation of uplink Spectral Efficiency (SE) within the standardized 5G Transmission Time Interval of 1 ms. These results affirm the viability of cell-free massive MIMO systems based on 5G standards and their potential integration into future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Loss-tolerant neural video codec aware congestion control for real time video communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of reinforcement learning's (RL) ability to automatically create more adaptive controlling logics beyond the hand-crafted heuristics, numerous effort has been made to apply RL to congestion control (CC) design for real time video communication (RTC) applications and has successfully shown promising benefits over the rule-based RTC CCs. Online reinforcement learning is often adopted to train the RL models so the models can directly adapt to real network environments. However, its trail-and-error manner can also cause catastrophic degradation of the quality of experience (QoE) of RTC application at run time. Thus, safeguard strategies such as falling back to hand-crafted heuristics can be used to run along with RL models to guarantee the actions explored in the training sensible, despite that these safeguard strategies interrupt the learning process and make it more challenging to discover optimal RL policies.
  The recent emergence of loss-tolerant neural video codecs (NVC) naturally provides a layer of protection for the online learning of RL-based congestion control because of its resilience to packet losses, but such packet loss resilience have not been fully exploited in prior works yet. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) based congestion control which can be aware of and takes advantage of packet loss tolerance characteristic of NVCs via reward in online RL learning. Through extensive evaluation on various videos and network traces in a simulated environment, we demonstrate that our NVC-aware CC running with the loss-tolerant NVC reduces the training time by 41\% compared to other prior RL-based CCs. It also boosts the mean video quality by 0.3 to 1.6dB, lower the tail frame delay by 3 to 200ms, and reduces the video stalls by 20\% to 77\% in comparison with other baseline RTC CCs.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Enabled Blockage-Aware Dynamic mmWave Multi-Hop V2X Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication offers unprecedented data rates and low latency, but faces significant reliability challenges due to signal blockages and limited range. This paper introduces a novel system for managing dynamic multi-hop mmWave V2X communications in complex blocking environments. We present a system architecture that integrates a mobility digital twin (DT) with the multi-hop routing control plane, providing a comprehensive, real-time view of the network and its surrounding traffic environment. This integration enables the control plane to make informed routing decisions based on rich contextual data about vehicles, infrastructure, and potential signal blockages. Leveraging this DT-enhanced architecture, we propose an advanced routing algorithm that combines high-precision environmental data with trajectory prediction to achieve blockage-aware mmWave multi-hop V2X routing. Our algorithm anticipates network topology changes and adapts topology dynamically to maintain reliable connections. We evaluate our approach through proof-of-concept simulations using a mobility DT of the Nishishinjuku area. Results demonstrate that our DT-enabled routing strategy significantly outperforms conventional methods in maintaining reliable mmWave V2X connections across various traffic scenarios, including fully connected and mixed traffic environments.</description>

      <title>AmazonNetLink: Enabling Education Access in Remote Amazonian Regions through Delay-Tolerant Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Access to educational materials in remote Amazonian communities is challenged by limited communication infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel delay-tolerant network (DTN) approach for content distribution and compares the Epidemic, MaxProp, and PRoPHETv2 routing protocols using the ONE simulator under dynamically changing educational file sizes. Results show that while Epidemic routing achieves higher delivery rates due to extensive message replication, it also leads to increased resource usage. MaxProp offers a balance between delivery efficiency and resource utilization by prioritizing message delivery based on predefined heuristics but struggles under high congestion and resource constraints. PRoPHETv2, with its probability-based forwarding, uses resources more efficiently but is less effective in dynamic, dense networks. This analysis highlights trade-offs between delivery performance and resource efficiency, guiding protocol selection for specific community needs. In our future work, we aim to explore adaptive buffer management and congestion-aware DTN protocols.</description>

      <title>MAREA: A Delay-Aware Multi-time-Scale Radio Resource Orchestrator for 6G O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN)-compliant solutions often lack crucial details for implementing effective control loops at various time scales. To overcome this, we introduce MAREA, an O-RAN-compliant mathematical framework designed for the allocation of radio resources to multiple ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) services. In the near-real-time (RT) control loop, MAREA employs a novel Martingales-based model to determine the guaranteed radio resources for each uRLLC service. Unlike traditional queueing theory approaches, this model ensures that the probability of packet transmission delays exceeding a predefined threshold -- the violation probability -- remains below a target tolerance.
  Additionally, MAREA uses a real-time control loop to monitor transmission queues and dynamically adjust guaranteed radio resources in response to traffic anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, MAREA is the first O-RAN-compliant solution that leverages Martingales for both near-RT and RT control loops. Simulations demonstrate that MAREA significantly outperforms reference solutions, achieving an average violation probability that is x10 lower.</description>

      <title>The Best Time for an Update: Risk-Sensitive Minimization of Age-Based Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Popular methods to quantify transmitted data quality are the Age of Information (AoI), the Query Age of Information (QAoI), and the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII). We consider these metrics in a point-to-point wireless communication system, where the transmitter monitors a process and sends status updates to a receiver. The challenge is to decide on the best time for an update, balancing the transmission energy and the age-based metric at the receiver. Due to the inherent risk of high age-based metric values causing complications such as unstable system states, we introduce the new concept of risky states to denote states with high age-based metric. We use this new notion of risky states to quantify and minimize this risk of experiencing high age-based metrics by directly deriving the frequency of risky states as a novel risk-metric. Building on this foundation, we introduce two risk-sensitive strategies for AoI, QAoI and AoII. The first strategy uses system knowledge, i.e., channel quality and packet arrival probability, to find an optimal strategy that transmits when the age-based metric exceeds a tunable threshold. A lower threshold leads to higher risk-sensitivity. The second strategy uses an enhanced Q-learning approach and balances the age-based metric, the transmission energy and the frequency of risky states without requiring knowledge about the system. Numerical results affirm our risk-sensitive strategies' high effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Scaling Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language model-driven autonomous agents have revealed that multi-agent collaboration often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning. Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons enhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of collaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration network (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically orchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale, with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their multidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement, thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/macnet.</description>

      <title>Automata Size Reduction by Procedure Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel paradigm for reducing the size of finite automata by compressing repeating sub-graphs. These repeating sub-graphs can be viewed as invocations of a single procedure. Instead of representing each invocation explicitly, they can be replaced by a single procedure that uses a small runtime memory to remember the call context. We elaborate on the technical details of a basic implementation of this idea, where the memory used by the procedures is a simple finite-state register. We propose methods for identifying repetitive sub-graphs, collapsing them into procedures, and measuring the resulting reduction in automata size. Already this basic implementation of reduction by procedure finding yields practically relevant results, particularly in the context of FPGA-accelerated pattern matching, where automata size is a primary bottleneck. We achieve a size reduction of up to 70\% in automata that had already been minimized using existing advanced methods.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Stable Matching between Workers and Spatial-Temporal Tasks for Dynamic MCS: A Stagewise Service Trading Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing proper incentives in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) networks represents a critical mechanism in engaging distributed mobile users (workers) to contribute heterogeneous data for diverse applications (tasks). We develop a novel stagewise trading framework to reach efficient and stable matching between tasks and workers, upon considering the diversity of tasks and the dynamism of MCS networks. This framework integrates futures and spot trading stages, where in the former, we propose futures trading-driven stable matching and pre-path-planning (FT-SMP$^3$) for long-term task-worker assignment and pre-planning of workers' paths based on historical statistics and risk analysis. While in the latter, we investigate spot trading-driven DQN path planning and onsite worker recruitment (ST-DP$^2$WR) mechanism to enhance workers' and tasks' practical utilities by facilitating temporary worker recruitment. We prove that our proposed mechanisms support crucial properties such as stability, individual rationality, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality theoretically. Also, comprehensive evaluations confirm the satisfaction of these properties in practical network settings, demonstrating our commendable performance in terms of service quality, running time, and decision-making overheads.</description>

      <title>Uni-Gaussians: Unifying Camera and Lidar Simulation with Gaussians for Dynamic Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles necessitates comprehensive simulation of multi-sensor data, encompassing inputs from both cameras and LiDAR sensors, across various dynamic driving scenarios. Neural rendering techniques, which utilize collected raw sensor data to simulate these dynamic environments, have emerged as a leading methodology. While NeRF-based approaches can uniformly represent scenes for rendering data from both camera and LiDAR, they are hindered by slow rendering speeds due to dense sampling. Conversely, Gaussian Splatting-based methods employ Gaussian primitives for scene representation and achieve rapid rendering through rasterization. However, these rasterization-based techniques struggle to accurately model non-linear optical sensors. This limitation restricts their applicability to sensors beyond pinhole cameras. To address these challenges and enable unified representation of dynamic driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach. Our method utilizes rasterization for rendering image data while employing Gaussian ray-tracing for LiDAR data rendering. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This work presents a unified and efficient solution for realistic simulation of camera and LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, offering significant advancements in both rendering quality and computational efficiency.</description>
