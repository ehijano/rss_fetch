      <title>Accounting for Selection Effects in Supernova Cosmology with Simulation-Based Inference and Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear exploding stars that can be used to put constraints on the nature of our universe. One challenge with population analyses of SNe Ia is Malmquist bias, where we preferentially observe the brighter SNe due to limitations of our telescopes. If untreated, this bias can propagate through to our posteriors on cosmological parameters. In this paper, we develop a novel technique of using a normalising flow to learn the non-analytical likelihood of observing a SN Ia for a given survey from simulations, that is independent of any cosmological model. The learnt likelihood is then used in a hierarchical Bayesian model with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling to put constraints on different sets of cosmological parameters conditioned on the observed data. We verify this technique on toy model simulations finding excellent agreement with analytically-derived posteriors to within $1 \sigma$.</description>

      <title>Emulation of $f(R)$ modified gravity from $\Lambda$CDM using conditional GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major aim of current and upcoming cosmological surveys is testing deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the full scientific value of these surveys will only be realised through efficient simulation methods that keep up with the increasing volume and precision of observational data. $N$-body simulations of modified gravity (MG) theories are computationally expensive since highly non-linear equations need to be solved to model the non-linear matter evolution; this represents a significant bottleneck in the path to reach the data volume and resolution attained by equivalent $\Lambda$CDM simulations. We develop a field-level, neural-network-based emulator that generates density and velocity divergence fields under the $f(R)$ gravity MG model from the corresponding $\Lambda$CDM simulated fields. Using attention mechanisms and a complementary frequency-based loss function, our model is able to learn this intricate mapping. We further use the idea of latent space extrapolation to generalise our emulator to $f(R)$ models with differing field strengths. The predictions of our emulator agree with the $f(R)$ simulations to within 5% for matter density and to within 10% for velocity divergence power spectra up to $k \sim 2\,h$ $\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. But for a few select cases, higher-order statistics are reproduced with $\lesssim$10% agreement with the $f(R)$ simulations. Latent extrapolation allows our emulator to generalise to different $f(R)$ model variants without explicitly training on those variants. Given a $\Lambda$CDM simulation, the GPU-based emulator is able to reproduce the equivalent $f(R)$ realisation $\sim$600 times faster than full $N$-body simulations. This lays the foundations for a valuable tool for realistic yet rapid mock field generation and robust cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>TensorFlow Hydrodynamics Analysis for Ly-$\alpha$ Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Python program THALAS (TensorFlow Hydrodynamics Analysis for Lyman-Alpha Simulations), which maps baryon fields (baryon density, temperature, and velocity) to Ly$\alpha$ optical depth fields in both real space and redshift space. Unlike previous Ly$\alpha$ codes, THALAS is fully differentiable, enabling a wide variety of potential applications for general analysis of hydrodynamical simulations and cosmological inference. To demonstrate THALAS's capabilities, we apply it to the Ly$\alpha$ forest inversion problem: given a Ly$\alpha$ optical depth field, we reconstruct the corresponding real-space dark matter density field. Such applications are relevant to both cosmological and three-dimensional tomographic analyses of Lyman Alpha forest data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian recalibration of Planck galaxy cluster scaling relations including relativistic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of relativistic SZ corrections on Planck measurements of massive galaxy clusters, finding that they have a significant impact at the $\approx$5 -- 15% and up to $\approx 3\sigma$ level. We investigate the possibility of constraining temperature directly from these SZ measurements but find that only weak constraints are possible for the most significant detections; for most clusters, an external temperature measurement is required to correctly measure integrated Compton-$y$. We also investigate the impact of profile shape assumptions and find that these have a small but non-negligible impact on measured Compton-$y$, at the $\approx$5% level.
  Informed by the results of these investigations, we recalibrate the Planck SZ observable-mass scaling relation, using the updated NPIPE data release and a larger sample of X-ray mass estimates. Along with the expected change in the high-mass end of the scaling relation, which does not impact Planck mass estimation, we also find hints of a low-mass deviation but this requires better understanding of the selection function in order to confirm.</description>

      <title>Primordial Intermediate-mass Binary Black Holes as Targets for Space Laser Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with log-normal mass spectrum with masses up to $\sim 10^4-10^5 M_\odot$ can be created after QCD phase transition in the early Universe at $z\sim 10^{12}$ by the modified Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. Using a model binary PBH formation, the expected detection rate of such binary intermediate-mass PBHs by the TianQin space laser interferometer is calculated to be from a few to hundreds events per year for the assumed parameters of the PBH log-normal mass spectrum and abundance consistent with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA results. Distinctive features of such primordial IMBH mergings are vanishingly small effective spins, possible high redshifts $z&gt;20$ and lack of association with gas-rich regions or galaxies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Web Dynamics: Forces and Strains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study concerns an inventory of the gravitational force and tidal field induced by filaments, walls, cluster nodes and voids on Megaparsec scales and how they assemble and shape the Cosmic Web. The study is based on a N$_{\rm Part}=512^3$ $\Lambda$CDM dark matter only N-body simulation in a (300$h^{-1}$~Mpc)$^3$ box at $z=0$. We invoke the density field NEXUS+ multiscale morphological procedure to assign the appropriate morphological feature to each location. We then determine the contribution by each of the cosmic web components to the local gravitational and tidal forces. We find that filaments are, by far, the dominant dynamical component in the interior of filaments, in the majority of underdense void regions and in all wall regions. The gravitational influence of cluster nodes is limited, and they are only dominant in their immediate vicinity. The force field induced by voids is marked by divergent outflowing patterns, yielding the impression of a segmented volume in which voids push matter towards their boundaries. Voids manifest themselves strongly in the tidal field as a cellular tapestry that is closely linked to the multiscale cosmic web. However, even within the interior of voids, the dynamical influence of the surrounding filaments is stronger than the outward push by voids. Therefore, the dynamics of voids cannot be understood without taking into account the influence of the environment. We conclude that filaments constitute the overpowering gravitational agent of the cosmic web, while voids are responsible for the cosmic web's spatial organisation and hence of its spatial connectivity.</description>

      <title>Constraining the impact of standard model phase transitions on primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions in the early universe lead to a reduction in the equation of state of the primordial plasma. This exponentially enhances the formation rate of primordial black holes. However, this sensitivity to the equation of state is the same that primordial black hole abundances show to the primordial curvature power spectrum amplitude. In this paper, we investigate peaked power spectra and show the challenges associated with motivating populations of primordial black holes with standard model enhancements. The parametrisation of different power spectra plays an important role in this discussion. The allowed parameter space consistent with a large QCD phase transition impact on the primordial black hole abundance differs greatly. This is particularly evident for wider spectra.</description>

      <title>Analytical Emulator for the Linear Matter Power Spectrum from Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and future large-scale structure surveys aim to constrain cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision by analyzing vast amounts of data. This imposes a pressing need to develop fast and accurate methods for computing the matter power spectrum $P(k)$, or equivalently, the matter transfer function $T(k)$. In previous works, we introduced precise fitting formulas for these quantities within the standard cosmological model, including extensions such as the presence of massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity. However, these formulations overlooked a key characteristic imprinted in $P(k)$: the baryon acoustic oscillation signal. Here, we leverage our understanding of the well-known physics behind this oscillatory pattern to impose constraints on our genetic algorithm, a machine learning technique. By employing this ``physics-informed'' approach, we introduce an expression that accurately describes the matter transfer function with sub-percent mean accuracy. The high interpretability of the output allows for straightforward extensions of this formulation to other scenarios involving massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity. We anticipate that this formula will serve as a competitive fitting function for $P(k)$, meeting the accuracy requirements essential for cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Testing the interacting dark energy model in a phenomenological scenario with gamma-ray bursts and Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize recent observational data from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and Pantheon+ Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) sample to explore the interacting Dark Energy (IDE) model in a phenomenological scenario. Results from GRBs-only, SNe Ia and GRBs+SNe Ia indicate that the energy is transferred from dark energy to dark matter and the coincidence problem is alleviated. The value of H0 from GRBs+SNe Ia in the IDE scenario shows agreement with the SH0ES measurement. Considering the age estimate of the quasar APM 08279+5255 at z = 3.91, we find that the phenomenological IDE scenario can predict a cosmic age greater than that of the {\Lambda}CDM model, thus the cosmic age problem can be alleviated.</description>

      <title>Unveiling galaxy pair alignment in cosmic filaments: A 3D exploration using EAGLE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how galaxy pairs are oriented in three dimensions within cosmic filaments using data from the EAGLE simulation. We identify filament spines using DisPerSE and isolate galaxies residing in filamentary environments. Employing a FoF algorithm, we delineate individual filaments and determine their axes by diagonalizing the moment of inertia tensor. The orientations of galaxy pairs relative to the axis of their host filament are analyzed. Our study covers diverse subsets of filaments identified through varying linking lengths, examining how galaxy pairs align with the filament axis across different spatial parameters such as pair separation and distance from the filament spine. We consistently observe a strong alignment pattern characterized by the probability distribution for the cosine of the orientation angle, which is nearly identical in each case. Furthermore, the study investigates the impact of redshift space distortions, confirming that the alignment signal persists in both real and redshift space. To validate our method, we employ Monte Carlo simulations with different theoretical probability distributions. Our results reaffirm previous findings with projected two-dimensional distributions and extend our understanding of how filaments impact the spatial organization and evolution of galaxies across cosmic scales.</description>

      <title>Robust Preference for Dynamical Dark Energy in DESI BAO and SN Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and two different samples of Type Ia supernovae (Pantheon-Plus and DESY5) reveal a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) characterized by a present-day quintessence-like equation of state that crossed into the phantom regime in the past. A core ansatz for this result is assuming a linear Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization $w(a) = w_0 + w_a (1-a)$ to describe the evolution of the DE equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we test if and to what extent this assumption impacts the results. To prevent broadening uncertainties in cosmological parameter inference and facilitate direct comparison with the baseline CPL case, we focus on 4 alternative well-known models that, just like CPL, consist of only two free parameters: the present-day DE EoS ($w_0$) and a parameter quantifying its dynamical evolution ($w_a$). We demonstrate that the preference for DDE remains robust regardless of the parameterization: $w_0$ consistently remains in the quintessence regime, while $w_a$ consistently indicates a preference for a dynamical evolution towards the phantom regime. This tendency is significantly strengthened by DESY5 SN measurements. By comparing the best-fit $\chi^2$ obtained within each DDE model, we notice that the linear CPL parameterization is not the best-fitting case. Among the models considered, the EoS proposed by Barboza and Alcaniz consistently leads to the most significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of bubble size distributions in a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi balls (FBs) and primordial black holes (PBHs) can be copiously produced during a dark first-order phase transition (FOPT). The radius distribution of false vacuum bubbles causes FBs and PBHs to have extended mass distributions. We show how gravitational wave (GW), microlensing and Hawking evaporation signals deviate from the case of monochromatic distributions. The peak of the GW spectrum is shifted to lower frequencies and the spectrum is broadened at frequencies below the peak frequency. Thus, the radius distribution of true vacuum bubbles introduces another uncertainty in the evaluation of the GW spectrum from a FOPT. The extragalactic gamma-ray signal at AMEGO-X/e-ASTROGAM from PBH evaporation may evince a break in the power-law spectrum between 5~MeV and 10~MeV for an extended PBH mass distribution. Optical microlensing surveys may observe PBHs lighter than $10^{-10}M_\odot$, which is not possible for monochromatic mass distributions. This expands the FOPT parameter space that can be explored with microlensing.</description>

      <title>Mildly Super-Eddington Accretion Onto Slowly-Spinning Black Holes Explains the X-Ray Weakness of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity AGN at $z&gt;4$ in compact, red hosts (the "Little Red Dots", or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using GRRMHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a SMBH with $M_\bullet=10^7 \,\rm M_\odot$ at $z\sim6$, representing the median population; the SEDs that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates ($1.4&lt;f_{\rm Edd}&lt;4$) with zero spin, viewed at angles $&gt;30^\circ$ from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed $2-10$ keV band reach $\sim10^4$ at $z=6$, $\sim5$ times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs exhibit $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ values outside standard ranges, with X-ray weakness increasing with optical-UV luminosity; they are also extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index $\Gamma=3.1$, mode of $\Gamma=4.4$). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot ($&gt;10^8$ K) and highly-relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing a SMBH within $10^\circ$ of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a $\sim1.5\%$ probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray weak LRDs at $z\sim6$ from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains $50\%$ of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of $\sim3$. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and hotspot formation around small primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantitatively analyze a basic question: what is the stationary solution of the background plasma temperature profile around a black hole (BH)? One may naively expect that the temperature profile continuously decreases from the Hawking temperature at the surface of the BH towards an outer region. We show analytically and numerically that this is not the case because local thermal equilibrium cannot be maintained near the surface of the BH and also because the high-energy particles emitted from Hawking radiation cannot be instantaneously thermalized into the background plasma. The temperature profile has a plateau within a finite distance from the BH, and even the overall amplitude of background temperature at a distance far away from the BH is significantly suppressed compared with the naive expectation. The main reason for these counterintuitive results comes from the fact that the size of the BH is too small that particles of Hawking radiation goes far away within the typical time scale of interactions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological selection of a small weak scale from large vacuum energy: a minimal approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal cosmological solution to the hierarchy problem. Our model consists of a light pseudoscalar and an extra Higgs doublet in addition to the field content of the Standard Model. We consider a landscape of vacua with varying values of the electroweak vacuum expectation value (VEV). The vacuum energy in our model peaks in a region of the landscape where the electroweak VEV is non-zero and much smaller than the cutoff. During inflation, due to exponential expansion, such regions of the landscape with maximal vacuum energy, dominate the universe in volume, thus explaining the smallness of the electroweak scale with respect to the cutoff. The pseudoscalar potential in our model is that of a completely generic pseudogoldstone boson$-$not requiring the clockwork mechanism$-$and its field value never exceeds its decay constant or the Planck scale. Our mechanism is robust to the variation of other model parameters in the landscape along with the electroweak VEV. It also predicts a precise and falsifiable relationship between the masses and couplings of the different Higgs boson mass-eigenstates. Moreover, the pseudoscalar in our model can account for the observed dark matter relic density.</description>

      <title>BUFFALO Wild Wings: A High Precision Free-Form Lens Model of MACSJ0416 with Constraints on Dark Matter from Substructure and Highly Magnified Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new free-form and hybrid mass reconstructions of the galaxy cluster lens MACS J0416.1-2403 at $z=0.396$ using the lens inversion method GRALE. The reconstructions use 237 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from Bergamini et. al. 2023 as the main input. Our primary model reconstructs images to a positional accuracy of 0.191", thus representing one of the most precise reconstructions of this lens to date. Our models find broad agreement with previous reconstructions, and identify two $\sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ light-unaffiliated substructures. We focus on two highly magnified arcs: Spock and Mothra. Our model features a unique critical curve structure around the Spock arc with 2 crossings. This structure enables sufficient magnification across this arc to potentially explain the large number of transients as microlensing events of supergiant stars. Additionally, we develop a model of the millilens substructure expected to be magnifying Mothra, which may be a binary pair of supergiants with $\mu \sim 6000$. This model accounts for flexibility in the millilens position while preserving the observed flux and minimizing image position displacements along the Mothra arc. We constrain the millilens mass and core radius to $\lesssim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and $\lesssim 12$ pc, respectively, which would render it one of the smallest and most compact substructures constrained by lensing. If the millilens is dominated by wave dark matter, the axion mass is constrained to be $&lt; 3.0 \times 10^{-21}$ eV. Further monitoring of this lens with JWST will uncover more transients, permitting tighter constraints on the structure surrounding these two arcs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the minimal Nelson-Barr model for solving the strong CP problem through the idea of spontaneous CP breaking. The minimal model suffers from the quality problem, which means that the strong CP angle is generated by higher-dimensional operators and one-loop effects. Consequently, it has been considered that there is a cosmological domain wall problem and that leptogenesis does not work. We point out that just imposing an additional approximate global symmetry solves the quality problem. We also propose a simple solution to the domain wall problem and show that the thermal leptogenesis scenario works.</description>

      <title>A smooth filament origin for prolate galaxies "going bananas" in deep JWST images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the abundant prolate shaped galaxies reported beyond z$&gt;$3 in deep JWST surveys, with the predicted {\it stellar} appearance of young galaxies in detailed hydro-simulations of three main dark matter contenders: Cold (CDM), Wave/Fuzzy ($\psi$DM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM). We find the observed galaxy images closely resemble the elongated stellar appearance of young galaxies predicted for both $\psi$DM and WDM, during the first $\simeq$ 500Myr while material steadily accretes from long, smooth filaments. The dark mater halos of WDM and $\psi$DM also have pronounced, prolate elongation similar to the stars, indicating a shared, highly triaxial equilibrium. This is unlike CDM where the early stellar morphology is mainly spheroidal formed from fragmented filaments with frequent merging, resulting in modest triaxiality. Quantitatively, the excess of prolate galaxies observed by JWST matches well WDM and $\psi$DM for particle masses of 1.4KeV and $2.5\times 10^{-22}$ eV respectively. For CDM, several visible subhalos are typically predicted to orbit within the virial radius of each galaxy from subhalo accretion, whereas merging is initially rare for WDM and $\psi$DM. We also verify with our simulations that $\psi$DM may be distinguished from WDM by the form of the core, which is predicted to be smooth and centered for WDM, but is a dense soliton for $\psi$DM traced by stars and measurably offset from the galaxy center by random wave perturbations in the simulations. We emphasise that long smooth filaments absent of galaxies may prove detectable with JWST, traced by stars and gas with comoving lengths of 150kpc predicted at z$\simeq$10, depending on the particle mass of $\psi$DM or WDM.</description>

      <title>Constraints on scalar and vector dark matter admixed neutron stars with linear and quadratic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of dark matter scalar and vector-mediated interactions on dark matter admixed neutron stars. In particular, we exploit the two-fluid formalism of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations as generic framework for dark matter admixed neutron stars. The fluids couple to each other only by gravity. In particular, the baryonic sector is described by the BSk22 equation of state, whereas we employ a relativistic mean field model for the dark matter, where we include the interaction of dark massive fermions with light dark scalar and vector mediators. We consider both the linear and the quadratic scalar interactions with the dark fermion. In the quadratic scalar scenario, we take into account a quartic self-interaction that significantly affects the stellar properties. Interestingly, in both cases, the effect of the scalar coupling is smaller than that of the vector, though quantitative differences arise. We also compute the sound speed of DM, finding that the scalar and quadratic couplings have an important influence on it. We compare our results with GW1708017, GW190425 and NICER data and constrain DM couplings and mass.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric surveys offer us a method to search for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves, by observing the deflection to the apparent positions of the stars. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below $6 \times 10^{-9}~{\rm Hz}$. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional $U(1)_{B}$ or $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interactions, and low-frequency gravitational waves as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than one order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic analysis of the strongly lensed SN~Encore: Constraints on cosmic evolution of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing magnifies the light from a background source, allowing us to study these sources in detail. Here, we study the spectra of a $z = 1.95$ lensed Type Ia supernova SN~Encore for its brightest Image A, taken 39 days apart. We infer the spectral age with template matching using the supernova identification (SNID) software and find the spectra to be at 29.0 $\pm 5.0$ and 37.4 $\pm 2.8$ rest-frame days post maximum respectively, consistent with separation in the observer frame after accounting for time-dilation. Since SNe~Ia measure dark energy properties by providing relative distances between low- and high-$z$ SNe, it is important to test for evolution of spectroscopic properties. Comparing the spectra to composite low-$z$ SN~Ia spectra, we find strong evidence for similarity between the local sample of SN~Encore. The line velocities of common SN~Ia spectral lines, Si II 6355 and Ca II NIR triplet are consistent with the distribution for the low-$z$ sample as well as other lensed SNe~Ia, e.g. iPTF16geu ($z = 0.409$) and SN~H0pe ($z = 1.78$). The consistency in SN~Ia spectra across cosmic time demonstrates the utility of using SNe~Ia in the very high-$z$ universe for dark energy inference. We also find that the spectra of SN~Encore match the predictions for explosion models very well. With future large samples of lensed SNe~Ia, spectra at such late phases will be important to distinguish between different explosion scenarios.</description>

      <title>An indirect search for dark matter with a combined analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies from VERITAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature and identity of dark matter is a key goal in the physics community. In the case that TeV-scale dark matter particles decay or annihilate into standard model particles, very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (greater than 100 GeV) will be present in the final state. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array that can indirectly detect VHE gamma rays in an energy range of 100 GeV to &gt; 30 TeV. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are ideal candidates in the search for dark matter due to their high dark matter content, high mass-to-light ratios, and their low gamma-ray fluxes from astrophysical processes. This study uses a legacy data set of 638 hours collected on 17 dSphs, built over 11 years with an observing strategy optimized according to the dark matter content of the targets. The study addresses a broad dark matter particle mass range, extending from 200 GeV to 30 PeV. In the absence of a detection, we set the upper limits on the dark matter velocity-weighted annihilation cross section.</description>

      <title>Application of the Eddington inversion method to constrain the dark matter halo of galaxies using only observed surface brightness profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: *** Context: The halos of low-mass galaxies may allow us to constrain the nature of dark matter (DM), but the kinematic measurements to diagnose the required properties are technically extremely challenging. However, the photometry of these systems is doable. Aims. Using only stellar photometry, constrain key properties of the DM haloes in low-mass galaxies. *** Methods: Unphysical pairs of DM gravitational potentials and starlight distributions can be identified if the pair requires a distribution function f that is negative somewhere in the phase space. We use the classical Eddington inversion method (EIM) to compute f for a battery of DM gravitational potentials and around 100 observed low-mass galaxies with Mstar between 10**6 and 10**8 Msun. The battery includes NFW potentials (expected from cold DM) and potentials stemming from cored mass distributions (expected in many alternatives to cold DM). The method assumes spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution and requires fitting the observed profiles with analytic functions, for which we use polytropes (with zero inner slope, a.k.a. core) and profiles with variable inner and outer slopes. The validity of all these assumptions is analyzed. *** Results: In general, the polytropes fit well the observed starlight profiles. If they were the correct fits (which could be the case) then all galaxies are inconsistent with NFW-like potentials. Alternatively, when the inner slope is allowed to vary for fitting, between 40% and 70% of the galaxies are consistent with cores in the stellar mass distribution and thus inconsistent with NFW-like potentials. *** Conclusions: Even though the stellar mass of the observed galaxies is still not low enough to constrain the nature of DM, this work shows the practical feasibility of the EIM technique to infer DM properties only from photometry.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of the first pulsar in a binary star system, the Hulse--Taylor pulsar, 50 years ago opened up an entirely new field of experimental gravity. For the first time it was possible to investigate strong-field and radiative aspects of the gravitational interaction. Continued observations of the Hulse--Taylor pulsar eventually led, among other confirmations of the predictions of general relativity (GR), to the first evidence for the reality of gravitational waves. In the meantime, many more radio pulsars have been discovered that are suitable for testing GR and its alternatives. One particularly remarkable binary system is the Double Pulsar, which has far surpassed the Hulse--Taylor pulsar in several respects. In addition, binary pulsar-white dwarf systems have been shown to be particularly suitable for testing alternative gravitational theories, as they often predict strong dipolar gravitational radiation for such asymmetric systems. A rather unique pulsar laboratory is the pulsar in a hierarchical stellar triple, that led to by far the most precise confirmation of the strong-field version of the universality of free fall. Using radio pulsars, it could be shown that additional aspects of the Strong Equivalence Principle apply to the dynamics of strongly self-gravitating bodies, like the local position and local Lorentz invariance of the gravitational interaction. So far, GR has passed all pulsar tests with flying colours, while at the same time many alternative gravity theories have either been strongly constrained or even falsified. New telescopes, instrumentation, timing and search algorithms promise a significant improvement of the existing tests and the discovery of (qualitatively) new, more relativistic binary systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling In-Situ Spheroid Formation in Distant, Submillimeter-Bright Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of stars in today's Universe reside within spheroids, which are bulges of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Their formation is still an unsolved problem. Infrared/submm-bright galaxies at high redshifts have long been suspected to be related to spheroids formation. Proving this connection has been hampered so far by heavy dust obscuration when focusing on their stellar emission or by methodologies and limited signal-to-noise ratios when looking at submm wavelengths. Here we show that spheroids are directly generated by star formation within the cores of highly luminous starburst galaxies in the distant Universe. This follows from the ALMA submillimeter surface brightness profiles which deviate significantly from those of exponential disks, and from the skewed-high axis-ratio distribution, both derived with a novel analysis technique. These galaxies are fully triaxial rather than flat disks: scale-height ratios are 0.5 on average and $&gt;0.6$ for most spatially compact systems. These observations, supported by simulations, reveal a cosmologically relevant pathway for in-situ spheroid formation through starbursts likely preferentially triggered by interactions (and mergers) acting on galaxies fed by non co-planar gas accretion streams.</description>

      <title>Joint Inference of Population, Cosmology, and Neutron Star Equation of State from Gravitational Waves of Dark Binary Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) are expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) emissions, which help to identify the host galaxy. Since GW events directly measure their luminosity distances, joint GW-EM observations from BNSs help to study cosmology, particularly the Hubble constant, unaffected by cosmic distance ladder systematics. However, detecting EM counterparts from BNS mergers is not always possible. Additionally, the tidal deformations of BNS components offer insights into the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS). In such cases, the tidal parameters of NSs, combined with the knowledge of the NS EoS, can break the degeneracy between mass parameters and redshift, allowing for the inference of the Hubble constant. Several efforts have aimed to infer the Hubble constant using the tidal parameters of BNSs, without EM counterparts, termed dark BNSs. Moreover, some studies have focused on the joint estimation of population and NS EoS for unbiased NS EoS estimation. However, none of the works consistently combined the uncertainties of population, cosmology, and NS EoS within a Bayesian framework. In this study, we propose a novel Bayesian analysis to jointly constrain the NS EoS, population, and cosmological parameters using a population of dark BNSs detected through GW observations. This method can well constrain the Hubble constant with as few as $5$ BNS observations using current-generation detectors. This level of precision is unattainable without incorporating the NS EoS, especially when observing BNS mergers without EM counterpart information.</description>

Abstract: Holographic dark energy theories present a fascinating interface to probe late-time cosmology, as guided by contemporary ideas about quantum gravity. In this work, we present a new holographic dark energy scenario designated Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). This model extends the conventional framework of HDEs by incorporating specific features from fractional calculus recently applied, e.g., in cosmological settings. In this manner, we retrieve a novel form of HDE energy density. We then show how FHDE can provide a consistent picture of the evolution of the late-time universe even with the simple choice of the Hubble horizon as the IR (infrared) cutoff. We provide detailed descriptions of the cosmological evolution, showing how the fractional calculus ingredients can alleviate quite a few issues associated with the conventional HDE scenario. Concretely, we compute and plot diagrams using the Hubble horizon cutoff for HDE. The density parameters for DE and dark matter (DM), the deceleration parameter, and the DE EoS parameter indicate how the universe may evolve within our FHDE model, fitting within an appropriate scenario of late-time cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) that have been multiply-imaged by gravitational lensing are rare and powerful probes for cosmology. Each detection is an opportunity to develop the critical tools and methodologies needed as the sample of lensed SNe increases by orders of magnitude with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The latest such discovery is of the quadruply-imaged Type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka, "SN Zwicky") at $z=0.3544$. SN Zwicky was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in spatially unresolved data. Here we present follow-up Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN Zwicky, the first from the multi-cycle "LensWatch" program. We measure photometry for each of the four images of SN Zwicky, which are resolved in three WFC3/UVIS filters (F475W, F625W, F814W) but unresolved with WFC3/IR~F160W, and present an analysis of the lensing system using a variety of independent lens modeling methods. We find consistency between lens model predicted time delays ($\lesssim1$ day), and delays estimated with the single epoch of HST colors ($\lesssim3.5$ days), including the uncertainty from chromatic microlensing ($\sim1$-$1.5$ days). Our lens models converge to an Einstein radius of $\theta_E=(0.168^{+0.009}_{-0.005})\prime\prime$, the smallest yet seen in a lensed SN system. The "standard candle" nature of SN Zwicky provides magnification estimates independent of the lens modeling that are brighter than predicted by $\sim1.7^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$mag and $\sim0.9^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$mag for two of the four images, suggesting significant microlensing and/or additional substructure beyond the flexibility of our image-position mass models.</description>

      <title>The pairwise and cross-pairwise y-type polarised kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich effect from transverse velocity of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new theoretical framework for studying the pairwise and cross-pairwise polarised kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich (pkSZ) effect arising from the transverse peculiar velocity of galaxy clusters. The pkSZ effect is second order in peculiar velocities and has a spectrum that can be decomposed into y-type and blackbody components, whereas the unpolarised linear kSZ effect has only the blackbody component. Thus, the detectability of the pkSZ effect depends only on the sensitivity and the number of frequency channels of the survey and not on the other primary and secondary CMB anisotropies. We consider pairing of clusters with other clusters as well as cross-pairing of clusters with galaxies from spectroscopic galaxy surveys. The pairwise pkSZ signal is a function of intra-pair spatial separation. We develop and compare estimators of the pairwise pkSZ effect and study the detectability of the pairwise signal with cluster catalogs consisting of a few hundred thousand clusters expected from surveys such as eROSITA and CMB-S4. We find that cross-pairing clusters with galaxies from a large overlapping spectroscopic survey having a few billion galaxies will enable us to detect the pairwise pkSZ effect with CMB-S4. The pairwise pkSZ effect will thus open up a new window into the large-scale structure of the Universe in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>JWST Photometric Time-Delay and Magnification Measurements for the Triply-Imaged Type Ia "Supernova H0pe" at z = 1.78</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) H0pe is a gravitationally lensed, triply-imaged, Type Ia SN (SN Ia) discovered in James Webb Space Telescope imaging of the PLCK G165.7+67.0 cluster of galaxies. Well-observed multiply-imaged SNe provide a rare opportunity to constrain the Hubble constant ($H_0$), by measuring the relative time delay between the images and modeling the foreground mass distribution. SN H0pe is located at $z=1.783$, and is the first SN Ia with sufficient light curve sampling and long enough time delays for an $H_0$ inference. Here we present photometric time-delay measurements and SN properties of SN H0pe. Using JWST/NIRCam photometry we measure time delays of $\Delta t_{ab}=-116.6^{+10.8}_{-9.3}$ and $\Delta t_{cb}=-48.6^{+3.6}_{-4.0}$ observer-frame days relative to the last image to arrive (image 2b; all uncertainties are $1\sigma$), which corresponds to a $\sim5.6\%$ uncertainty contribution for $H_0$ assuming $70 \rm{km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. We also constrain the absolute magnification of each image to $\mu_{a}=4.3^{+1.6}_{-1.8}$, $\mu_{b}=7.6^{+3.6}_{-2.6}$, $\mu_{c}=6.4^{+1.6}_{-1.5}$ by comparing the observed peak near-IR magnitude of SN H0pe to the non-lensed population of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Lensed Type Ia Supernova "Encore" at z=2: The First Instance of Two Multiply-Imaged Supernovae in the Same Host Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bright ($m_{\rm F150W,AB}$=24 mag), $z=1.95$ supernova (SN) candidate was discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging acquired on 2023 November 17. The SN is quintuply-imaged as a result of strong gravitational lensing by a foreground galaxy cluster, detected in three locations, and remarkably is the second lensed SN found in the same host galaxy. The previous lensed SN was called "Requiem", and therefore the new SN is named "Encore". This makes the MACS J0138.0$-$2155 cluster the first known system to produce more than one multiply-imaged SN. Moreover, both SN Requiem and SN Encore are Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia), making this the most distant case of a galaxy hosting two SNe Ia. Using parametric host fitting, we determine the probability of detecting two SNe Ia in this host galaxy over a $\sim10$ year window to be $\approx3\%$. These observations have the potential to yield a Hubble Constant ($H_0$) measurement with $\sim10\%$ precision, only the third lensed SN capable of such a result, using the three visible images of the SN. Both SN Requiem and SN Encore have a fourth image that is expected to appear within a few years of $\sim2030$, providing an unprecedented baseline for time-delay cosmography.</description>

      <title>Flashlights: Transients among Gravitationally-Lensed Star Clusters in the Dragon Arc. I. Stellar Microlensing vs Stellar Outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of transients among star clusters in a distant galaxy that is gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy cluster, and explore whether these transients correspond to: (i) intrinsic variations associated with stellar outbursts; or (ii) extrinsic variations imposed through microlensing by intraclusters stars along, perhaps, with primordial black holes. From images at two epochs separated by nearly a year, we discovered ten such transients -- displaying brightness variations of $\sim$10\%--20\% -- among 55 persistent knots identified as young star clusters in the Dragon arc. Two of these transients are associated with a triply-lensed star cluster, permitting a test of intrinsic variability by checking whether their light variations are repeated among the different lensed counterparts with a suitable time delay given their different light arrival times at the observer. Despite considerable care in constructing a lens model for Abell 370 that is optimized at the Dragon arc, we found that the predicted lensing magnifications are not sufficiently accurate to provide a definitive test of intrinsic variability based only on two images -- although such a test will become feasible as more observations are made. On the other hand, we perform simulations demonstrating that the observed level of brightness variations, as well as the observed transient event rate, can be explained entirely by stellar microlensing: as stars in the background star cluster move across the sky relative to intracluster stars, changes in their individual brightnesses can result in an overall change in the brightness of their parent star cluster.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing bounce and inflation via quantum signatures from cosmic microwave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological inflation is a popular paradigm for understanding Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR); however, it faces many conceptual challenges. An alternative mechanism to inflation for generating an almost scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations is a \emph{bouncing cosmology} with an initial matter-dominated contraction phase, during which the modes corresponding to currently observed scales exited the Hubble radius. Bouncing cosmology avoids the initial singularity but has fine-tuning problems. Taking an \emph{agnostic view} of the two early-universe paradigms, we propose a quantum measure -- Dynamical Fidelity Susceptibility (DFS) of CMBR -- that distinguishes the two scenarios. Taking two simple models with the same power-spectrum, we explicitly show that DFS behaves differently for the two scenarios. We discuss the possibility of using DFS as a distinguisher in the upcoming space missions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Neutrino Masses: Insights from Robust (e)BOSS Data Analysis and Prospects for DESI and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent findings from DESI BAO combined with Planck CMB data have set an upper limit on the total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.072\, \text{eV}$ (95% confidence level), ruling out the inverted hierarchy. Indeed, methods that rely on the background expansion of the Universe tend to suggest negative neutrino masses. In this work, we contribute to the quest for accurately constraining neutrino mass using cosmological probes. By conducting a full-shape analysis on data from BOSS, eBOSS, and synthetic power spectra, we showed that projection effects can significantly influence constraints on neutrino mass, rendering these measurements largely unreliable. Our results highlight the need for better techniques to measure the neutrino mass accurately. Based on the large-scale structure suppression, we identified a critical blind spot in the full-shape analysis. By splitting the galaxy power spectrum into broadband and wiggles, we noticed that information on neutrino mass is primarily extracted from the suppressed wiggles rather than broadband suppression. This opens the possibility of developing alternative methods based only on the wiggles of the power spectrum that can be more robust than those heavily reliant on background evolution.</description>

      <title>GLANCE -- Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-Modelled Cross-Correlation Exploration of Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is the phenomenon where the presence of matter (called a lens) bends the path of light-like trajectories travelling nearby. Similar to the geometric optics limit of electromagnetic waves, gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can occur in geometric optics condition when GW wavelength is much smaller than the Schwarzschild radius of the lens i.e. $\lambda_{GW} \ll$ R$^{\rm s}_{\rm lens}$. This is known as the strong-lensing regime for which a multiple-image system with different magnifications and phase-shifts is formed. We developed $\texttt{GLANCE}$, Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-modelled Cross-correlation Exploration, a novel technique to detect strongly lensed GW signals. We demonstrate that cross-correlation between two noisy reconstruction of polarized GW signals shows a non-zero value when the signals are lensed counterparts. The relative strength between the signal cross-correlation and noise cross-correlation can quantify the significance of the event(s) being lensed. Since lensing biases the inference of source parameters, primarily the luminosity distance, a joint parameter estimation of the source and lens-induced parameters is incorporated using a Bayesian framework. We applied $\texttt{GLANCE}$ to synthetic strong lensing data and showed that it can detect lensed GW signals and correctly constrain the injected source and lens parameters, even when one of the signals is below match-filtered threshold signal-to-noise ratio. This demonstrates $\texttt{GLANCE}'$s capability as a robust detection technique for strongly lensed GW signals and can distinguish between lensed and unlensed events.</description>

      <title>A small cosmological constant from a large number of extra dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the $4+n$ dimensional spacetimes among which one is the four dimensional physical Universe and the other is an n-dimensional sphere with constant radius in the framework of Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. We find that the curvature of extra dimensional sphere contributes a huge but negative energy density provided that its radius is sufficiently small, such as the scale of Planck length. Therefore, the huge positive vacuum energy, i.e. the large positive cosmological constant is exactly cancelled out by the curvature of extra sphere. In the mean time the higher order of Lanczos-Lovelock term contributes an observations-allowed small cosmological constant if the number of extra dimensions is sufficiently large, such as $n\approx{69}$.</description>
