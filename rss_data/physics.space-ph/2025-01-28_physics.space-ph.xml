      <title>Ion Beam Instabilities during Solar Flare Energy Release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear stability of waves driven by ion beams produced during solar flare energy release are explored to assess their role in driving abundance enhancements in minority species such as $^3$He and in controlling, through pitch-angle scattering, proton/alpha confinement during energy release. The Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (ALPS) is used to solve the linear dispersion relation for a population of energetic, reconnection-accelerated protons streaming into a cold background plasma. We assume equal densities of the two populations, using an anisotropic ($T_\parallel/T_\perp = 10$), one-sided kappa distribution for the energetic streaming population and a cold Maxwellian for the background. We find two unstable modes with parallel propagation: a right-handed wave with a frequency of the order of the proton cyclotron frequency ($\Omega_{cp}$) and a left-handed, lower frequency mode. We also find highly oblique modes with frequencies below $\Omega_{cp}$ that are unstable for higher beam energies. Through resonant interactions, all three modes will contribute to the scattering of the high-energy protons, thereby limiting their transport out of the flare-acceleration region. The higher-frequency oblique mode, which can be characterized as a kinetic Alfv\'en wave, will preferentially heat $^3$He, making it a good candidate for the driver of the abundance enhancements commonly observed for this species in impulsive events.</description>

      <title>Comparing Methods for Calculating Solar Energetic Particle Intensities: Re-binning versus Spectral Binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been observed for decades in the interplanetary medium by spacecraft measuring the intensity of energetic ions and electrons. These intensities provide valuable information about particle acceleration, the effects of bulk plasma dynamics on particle transport, and the anisotropy of particle distributions. Since measured intensities are typically reported in narrow energy bins, it is common to re-bin intensities over a wider energy range to improve counting statistics. We investigate two methods for calculating intensities across multiple energy bins: a) \textit{re-binned intensity} (\(\overline{j}_{\rm linlin}\)), which is calculated by integrating the intensity over energy space and corresponds to the intensity at an effective energy that depends on the time-varying spectral index, and b) \textit{spectral binned intensity} (\(\overline{j}_{\rm loglog}\)), calculated by integrating the log-intensity in log-energy space, yielding the intensity at the log-centered energy that is independent of the spectral index and remains constant over time. We compare these methods using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) IS\(\odot\)IS measurements of energetic protons, and we prescribe criteria for selecting the appropriate method for different scenarios. Our results show that the re-binned intensity is consistently larger (up to a factor of 5) than the spectral binned intensity for two SEP events observed by PSP, although the time series of the two methods are strongly correlated. Overall, both measures are important for SEP spectral analysis, and the selection of the appropriate measure depends on whether a physical (spectral binned intensity) or a statistical (re-binned intensity) representation is needed for a given analysis.</description>

      <title>Global Heliospheric Termination Shock Strength in the Solar-Interstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A heliospheric termination shock (HTS) surrounds our solar system at approximately 100 astronomical units from the Sun, where the expanding solar wind (SW) is compressed and heated before encountering the interstellar medium. HTS-accelerated particles govern the pressure balance with the interstellar medium, but little is known about the HTS's global properties beyond in situ measurements from Voyager in only two directions of the sky. We fill this gap in knowledge with a novel and complex methodology: particle-in-cell, test particle, and MHD simulations, combined with a global minimization scheme to derive global HTS compression ratio sky maps. The methods utilize Interstellar Boundary Explorer observations of energetic neutral atoms produced from HTS-accelerated particles. Our results reveal unique, three-dimensional characteristics, such as higher compression near the poles during solar minimum, north-south asymmetries from the disparate polar coronal holes' evolution, and minimum compression near the flanks likely from SW slowing by mass-loading over a greater distance to the HTS.</description>

      <title>Constraining Disk-to-Corona Power Transfer Fraction, Soft X-ray Excess Origin, and Black Hole Spin Population of Type-1 AGN across Mass Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of the accretion disk, its interplay with the X-ray corona, and assessing black hole spin demographics are some open challenges in astrophysics. In this work, we examine the predictions of the standard $\alpha$-disk model, origin of the soft X-ray excess, and measure the black hole spin parameter by applying the updated high-density disk reflection model to the XMM-Newton/NuSTAR broadband (0.3$-$78 keV) X-ray spectra of a sample of Type-1 AGN. Our Bayesian analysis confirms that the high-density relativistic reflection model with a broken power-law emissivity profile can simultaneously fit the soft X-ray excess, broad iron K line, and Compton hump for $\sim$70% of the sample, while an additional warm Comptonization model is still required to describe the observed soft X-ray excess for the remaining sources. Our first-ever calculation of the disk-to-corona power transfer fraction reveals that the fraction of power released from the accretion disk into the hot corona can have diverse values, the sample median of which is $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.2}$. We find that the transferred power from the accretion disk can potentially soften the X-ray spectrum of the hot corona. The median values of the hot coronal temperature and optical depth for the sample are estimated to be $63_{-11}^{+23}$ keV and $0.85_{-0.27}^{+0.12}$, respectively. Finally, through joint XMM-Newton+NuSTAR relativistic reflection spectroscopy, we systematically constrain the black hole spin parameter across the broad range of black hole masses, $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) \sim 5.5-9.0$, and increase the available spin measurements in the AGN population by $\sim$20%.</description>

      <title>Novel Dark Matter Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Celestial observations often exhibit inexplicable planetary dependencies when the timing of an observable is projected onto planetary heliocentric positions. This is possible only for incident, non-relativistic streams. Notably, the celebrated dark matter (DM) in the Universe can form streams in our vicinity with speeds of about 240 km/s. Since gravitational impact scales with $1/(\text{velocity})^2$, all solar system objects, including the Sun and the Moon, act as strong gravitational lenses, with their focal planes located within the solar system. Even the Moon can focus penetrating particles toward the Earth at speeds of up to approximately 400 km/s, covering a large portion of the phase space of DM constituents. Consequently, the unexpected planetary dependencies of solar system observables may provide an alternative to Zwicky's tension regarding the overestimated visible cosmic mass. In this work, an overlooked but unexpected planetary dependency of any local observable serves as an analogue to Zwicky's cosmic measurements, particularly if a similar mysterious behavior has been previously noted. Thus, a persistent, unexpected planetary dependency represents a new tension between observation and expectation. The primary argument supporting DM in line with Zwicky's paradigm is this planetary dependency, which, on a local scale, constitutes the novel tension between observation and expectation. In particular, the recurrent planetary dependency of diverse observables mirrors Zwicky's cosmic tension with the overestimated visible mass. No other approach accounts for so many otherwise striking and mysterious observations in physics and medicine.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Solar Eruption, EUV Wave Propagation, and Wave-Induced Prominence Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) waves, frequently produced by eruptions, propagate through the non-uniform magnetic field of the solar corona and interact with distant prominences, inducing their global oscillations. However, the generation, propagation, and interaction of these waves with distant prominences remain poorly understood. We aim to study the influence of an eruptive flux rope (EFR) on a distant prominence by means of extreme-resolution numerical simulations. We cover a domain of horizontal extent of 1100 Mm while capturing details down to 130 km using automated grid refinement. We performed a 2.5D numerical experiment using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC 3.1 code, modeling an eruption as a 2.5D catastrophe scenario augmented with a distant dipole magnetic field to form the flux rope prominence. Our findings reveal that the EFR becomes unstable and generates a quasicircular front. The primary front produces a slow secondary front when crossing equipartition lines where the Alfv\'en speed is close to the sound speed. The resulting fast and slow EUV waves show different behaviors, with the fast EUV wave slightly decelerating as it propagates through the corona, while the slow EUV wave forms a stationary front. The fast EUV wave interacts with the remote prominence, driving both transverse and longitudinal oscillations. Additionally, magnetic reconnection at a null point below the prominence flux rope is triggered by the fast EUV wave, affecting the flux rope magnetic field and the prominence oscillations. Our study unifies important results of the dynamics of eruptive events and their interactions with distant prominences, including details of (oscillatory) reconnection and chaotic plasmoid dynamics. We demonstrate for the first time the full consequences of remote eruptions on prominence dynamics and clarify the damping mechanisms of prominence oscillations.</description>

      <title>Icarus 3.0: Dynamic Heliosphere Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather predictions are necessary to avoid damage caused by intense geomagnetic storms. Such strong storms are usually caused by a co-rotating interaction region (CIR) passing at Earth or by the arrival of strong coronal mass ejections (CMEs). To mitigate the damage, the effect of propagating CMEs in the solar wind must be estimated accurately at Earth and other locations. Modelling solar wind accurately is crucial for space weather predictions, as it is the medium for CME propagation. The Icarus heliospheric modelling tool is upgraded to handle dynamic inner heliospheric driving instead of using steady boundary conditions. The ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver and the automated grid-adaptivity are adjusted to the latest MPI-AMRVAC version. The inner boundary conditions, prescribed at 0.1 AU for the heliospheric model, are updated time-dependently throughout the simulation. The coronal model is computed repeatedly for selected magnetograms. The particle sampling within MPI-AMRVAC is extended to handle stretched spherical grid information. The solar wind obtained in the simulation is dynamic and shows significant variations throughout the evolution. When comparing the results with the observations, the dynamic solar wind results are more accurate than previous results obtained with purely steady boundary driving. The CMEs propagated through the dynamic solar wind background produce more similar signatures in the time-series data than in the steady solar wind. Dynamic boundary driving in Icarus results in a more self-consistent solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere. The obtained space weather modelling tool for dynamic solar wind and CME simulations is better suited for space weather forecasting than a steady solar wind model.</description>

      <title>Will nanodust reappear in STEREO/WAVES data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanodust particles produced near the Sun by collisional breakup of larger grains are accelerated in the magnetised solar wind and reach high speeds outwards of 1 AU. Vaporisation and ionisation of fast dust grains impacting a spacecraft produce voltage pulses on wave instruments that enable them to act as dust detectors. Wave instruments on STEREO and on Cassini during its cruise phase detected a highly variable flux of fast nanodust. Both detections took place when the orientation of the solar magnetic dipole produced an interplanetary electric field that focused nanoparticles towards the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) - a geometry that is recurring because of the periodicity of solar activity.</description>

      <title>Production and Loss Processes of Hydrogen Energetic Neutral Atoms in the Heliosphere from 5 eV to 500 keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) observations provide valuable insights into the plasma conditions in the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium. Unlike plasma detectors, which measure charged particles tied to the magnetic fields at their location, ENA detectors capture former ions that were neutralized in distant regions and traverse the heliosphere in straight trajectories. ENA fluxes near the Sun represent line-of-sight integrals of parent ion fluxes multiplied by neutralization (production) rates and reduced by the probability of ENA reionization (loss) processes. So far, most ENA analyses have focused on charge exchange between hydrogen atoms and protons as the primary source of ENAs. Here, we examine various ENA production and loss processes throughout the heliosphere in the broad energy range (5 eV to 500 keV) encompassing the next-generation ENA instruments aboard the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission. Our study considers binary collisions involving the most abundant species: protons, electrons, {\alpha}-particles, He+ ions, photons, as well as hydrogen and helium atoms. Our findings indicate that, in addition to ENAs produced by charge exchange of energetic protons with hydrogen atoms, a significant portion of high-energy ENAs originate from the charge exchange with helium atoms. Below 10 keV, the dominant ENA loss processes are charge exchange collisions with protons and photoionization. However, stripping ionization processes, e.g., from collisions with ambient interstellar neutral hydrogen, become the main loss mechanism for higher energies because the charge exchange rate rapidly decreases.</description>
