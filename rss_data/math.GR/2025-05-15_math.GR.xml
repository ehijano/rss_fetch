      <title>Commuting probability for conjugate subgroups of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two subgroups H,K of a finite group G, the probability that a pair of random elements from H and K commutes is denoted by \pr(H,K). We address the following question.
  Let P be a p-subgroup of a finite group G and assume that \pr(P,P^x)\geq\e&gt;0 for every x\in G. Is the order of P modulo O_p(G) bounded in terms of e only?
  With respect to this question, we establish several positive results but show that in general the answer is negative. In particular, we prove that if the composition factors of G which are isomorphic to simple groups of Lie type in characteristic p, have Lie rank at most n, then the order of P modulo O_p(G) is bounded in terms of n and e only. If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then the order of P modulo O_p(G) is bounded in terms e only. Some other results of similar flavour are established.
  We also show that if \pr(P_1,P_2)&gt;0 for every two Sylow p-subgroups P_1,P_2 of a profinite group G, then O_{p,p'}(G) is open in G.</description>

      <title>A Structural Analysis of Infinity in Set Theory and Modern Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained analysis of infinity from two mathematical perspectives: set theory and algebra. We begin with cardinal and ordinal numbers, examining deep questions such as the continuum hypothesis, along with foundational results such as the Schr\"oder-Bernstein theorem, multiple proofs of the well-ordering of cardinals, and various properties of infinite cardinals and ordinals. Transitioning to algebra, we analyze the interplay between finite and infinite algebraic structures, including groups, rings, and $R$-modules. Major results, such as the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, Krull's Theorem, Hilbert's basis theorem, and the equivalence of free and projective modules over principal ideal domains, highlight the connections and differences between finite and infinite structures, as well as demonstrating the relationship between set-theoretic and algebraic treatments of infinity. Through this approach, we provide insights into how key results about infinity interact with and inform one another across set-theoretic and algebraic mathematics.</description>

      <title>Ask zeta functions of joins of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work (arXiv:1908.09589), we studied rational generating functions ("ask zeta functions") associated with graphs and hypergraphs. These functions encode average sizes of kernels of generic matrices with support constraints determined by the graph or hypergraph in question, with applications to the enumeration of linear orbits and conjugacy classes of unipotent groups. In the present article, we turn to the effect of a natural graph-theoretic operation on associated ask zeta functions. Specifically, we show that two instances of rational functions, $W^-_\Gamma(X,T)$ and $W^\sharp_\Gamma(X,T)$, associated with a graph $\Gamma$ are both well-behaved under taking joins of graphs. In the former case, this has applications to zeta functions enumerating conjugacy classes associated with so-called graphical groups.</description>

      <title>On the Aldous-Caputo Spectral Gap Conjecture for Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their celebrated paper (arXiv:0906.1238), Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer proved Aldous' conjecture and showed that for an arbitrary finite graph, the spectral gap of the interchange process is equal to the spectral gap of the underlying random walk. A crucial ingredient in the proof was the Octopus Inequality - a certain inequality of operators in the group ring $\mathbb{R}[\mathrm{Sym}_n]$ of the symmetric group. Here we generalize the Octopus Inequality and apply it to generalize the Caputo-Liggett-Richthammer Theorem to certain hypergraphs, proving some cases of a conjecture of Caputo.</description>
