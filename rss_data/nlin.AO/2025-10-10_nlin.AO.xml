      <title>Three-state coevolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental feedback mechanisms are ubiquitous in real-world complex systems. In this study, we incorporate a homogeneous environment into the evolutionary dynamics of a three-state system comprising cooperators, defectors, and empty nodes. Both coherence resonance and equilibrium states, resulting from the tightly clustering of cooperator agglomerates, enhance population survival and environmental quality. The resonance phenomenon arises at the transition between cooperative and defective payoff parameters in the prisoner's dilemma game.</description>

      <title>Spike-frequency and h-current based adaptation are dynamically equivalent in a Wilson-Cowan field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During slow-wave sleep, the brain produces traveling waves of slow oscillations (SOs; $\leq 2$ Hz), characterized by the propagation of alternating high- and low-activity states. The question of internal mechanisms that modulate traveling waves of SOs is still unanswered although it is established that it is an adaptation mechanism that mediates them. One mechanism investigated is spike-frequency adaptation, a hyperpolarizing feedback current that is activated during periods of high-activity. An alternative mechanism is based on hyperpolarization-activated currents, which are positive feedback currents that are activated in low-activity states. Both adaptation mechanisms were shown to feature SO-like dynamics in neuronal populations, and the inclusion of a spatial domain seems to enhance observable differences in their effects. To investigate this in detail, we examine a spatially extended two-population Wilson-Cowan model with local spatial coupling and the excitatory populations equipped with either one of the two adaptation mechanisms. We describe them with the same dynamical equation and include the inverse mode of action by changing the signs of adaptation strength and gain. We show that the dynamical systems are mathematically equivalent under a compensatory external input, which depends on the adaptation strength, leading to a shift in state space of the otherwise equivalent bifurcation structure. Strong enough adaptation is required to induce traveling waves. Additionally, adaptation modulates the properties of the spatio-temporal activity patterns, such as temporal and spatial frequencies, and the speed of the traveling waves, all of which increase with increasing strength. Though being dynamically equivalent, our results also explain why location-dependent variations in feedback strength cause differences in the propagation of traveling waves between both adaptation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Local active error correction from simulated confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. On a system of linear size $L$, our decoder requires access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each qubit, and we prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in $L$. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</description>

      <title>Self-replication and Computational Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-replication is central to all life, and yet how it dynamically emerges in physical, non-equilibrium systems remains poorly understood. Von Neumann's pioneering work in the 1940s and subsequent developments suggest a natural hypothesis: that any physical system capable of Turing-universal computation can support self-replicating objects. In this work, we challenge this hypothesis by clarifying what computational universality means for physical systems and constructing a cellular automaton that is Turing-universal but cannot sustain non-trivial self-replication. By analogy with biology, such dynamics manifest transcription and translation but cannot instantiate replication. More broadly, our work emphasizes that the computational complexity of translating between physical dynamics and symbolic computation is inseparable from any claim of universality (exemplified by our analysis of Rule 110) and builds mathematical foundations for identifying self-replicating behavior. Our approach enables the formulation of necessary dynamical and computational conditions for a physical system to constitute a living organism.</description>

      <title>Kinetic description of one-dimensional stochastic dynamics with small inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study single-variable approaches for describing stochastic dynamics with small inertia. The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian particles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting Josephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear dissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear dissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the characterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in four representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and the formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous mathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear dissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the former, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter case, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an effective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional mechanism is impossible. In the four considered representations, truncated equation chains are demonstrated to be utilitary for numerical simulation for a small finite inertia.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Models of Neuronal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuronal circuits arise as axons and dendrites extend, navigate, and connect to target cells. Axonal growth, in particular, integrates deterministic guidance from substrate mechanics and geometry with stochastic fluctuations generated by signaling, molecular detection, cytoskeletal assembly, and growth cone dynamics. A comprehensive quantitative description of this process remains incomplete. We review stochastic models in which Langevin dynamics and the associates Fokker-Planck equation capture axonal motion and turning under combined biases and noise. Paired with experiments, these models yield key parameters, including effective diffusion (motility) coefficients, speed and angle distributions, mean-square displacement, and mechanical measures of cell-substrate coupling, thereby linking single-cell biophysics and intercellular interactions to collective growth statistics and network formation. We further couple the Fokker-Planck description to a mechanochemical actin-myosin-clutch model and perform a linear stability analysis of the resulting dynamics. Routh--Hurwitz criteria identify regimes of steady extension, damped oscillations, and Hopf bifurcations that generate sustained limit cycles. Together, these results clarify the mechanisms that govern axonal guidance and connectivity and inform the design of engineered substrates and neuroprosthetic scaffolds aimed at enhancing nerve repair and regeneration.</description>
