      <title>Population-resolved measurement of an avoided crossing of light-dressed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-level system coupled by a coherent field is a ubiquitous system in atomic and molecular physics. In the rotating wave approximation, the light-dressed states are well described by a simple 2x2 Hamiltonian which can be easily solved analytically and is thus used in quantum mechanics education and as a basis for intuition for more complicated systems. The solution to the Hamiltonian is an avoided crossing between the light-dressed ground and excited states. In experiments, the avoided crossing is probed spectroscopically, meaning only the energies, or eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, are measured. Here, we present a measurement of the avoided crossing which also resolves population, thus indicating the amplitude coefficients of the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian. We perform the measurement in Rydberg states of cold rubidium atoms, resolving the energies spectroscopically with our pump lasers and the populations of each state using selective field ionization.</description>

      <title>Imaging scattering resonances in low-energy inelastic ND$_3$-H$_2$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scattering resonance is one of the most striking quantum effects in low-temperature molecular collisions. Predicted decades ago theoretically, they have only been resolved experimentally for systems involving at most four atoms. Extension to more complex systems is essential to probe the true quantum nature of chemically more relevant processes, but is thus far hampered by major obstacles. Here, we present a joint experimental and theoretical study of scattering resonances in state-to-state inelastic collisions for the six-atom ND$_3$-H$_2$/HD systems across the collision energy range 0.5-25 cm$^{-1}$, bringing this type of experiment into the realm of polyatomic symmetric top molecules. Strong resonances are resolved in the integral cross sections, whereas differential cross sections are measured with high resolution using a laser ionization scheme involving VUV light. The experimental data could only be reproduced using theoretical predictions based on a potential energy surface at the CCSD(T) level of theory with corrections at the CCSDT(Q) level.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced optical ion clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled states hold the promise of improving the precision and accuracy of quantum sensors. We experimentally demonstrate that spectroscopy of an optical clock transition using entangled states can outperform its classical counterpart. Two ^{40}\text{Ca}^{+} ions are entangled in a quantum state with vanishing first-order magnetic field sensitivity, extending the coherence time of the atoms and enabling near lifetime-limited probe times of up to 550 ms. In our protocol, entangled ions reach the same instability as uncorrelated ions, but at half the probe time, enabling faster cycle times of the clock. We run two entangled ^{40}\text{Ca}^{+} ions as an optical clock and compare its frequency instability with a ^{87}\text{Sr} lattice clock. The instability of the entangled ion clock is below a clock operated with classically correlated states for all probe times. We observe instabilities below the theoretically expected quantum projection noise limit of two uncorrelated ions for interrogation times below 100 ms. The lowest fractional frequency instability of 7e-16 / sqrt(tau / 1 s) is reached for 250 ms probe time, limited by residual phase noise of the probe laser. This represents the lowest instability reported to date for a ^{40}\text{Ca}^{+} ion clock.</description>

      <title>Radar Ranging Using Rydberg Atomic Homodyne Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar ranging is a key technology for environment sensing, target tracking, and navigation, yet traditional radar front-ends are still physically limited by antenna aperture and microwave electronics bandwidth. To overcome these limitations, we propose and experimentally validate a homodyne radar architecture based on Rydberg atoms, which uses a centimeter-scale atomic vapor cell replacing the antenna-to-mixer portion of a conventional receiver end. This approach is based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting effect, where zero-intermediate-frequency mixing is performed directly within the atomic medium through an external co-frequency reference for optical baseband readout. Aiming at the intrinsically narrow instantaneous atomic bandwidth, we implement a non-uniform stepped-frequency synthesis strategy combining coarse laser frequency tuning with fine AC-Stark shift compensation, enabling an effective synthesized bandwidth of GHz-level across the S-band (2.6-3.6 GHz). Additionally, we establish a nonlinear response model of the Rydberg atomic homodyne receiver and propose a customized nonlinear predistortion method that extends the linear dynamic range by more than 7 dB. We develop a CS-Rydberg algorithm incorporating compressive sensing to suppress noise and mitigate the undersampling problem. Experimental validations within target distances from 1.6 to 1.9 m demonstrate centimeter-level ranging accuracy (root-mean-square error = 1.04 cm) and a range resolution better than 15 cm. These results validate the feasibility of quantum radar receiving technology based on Rydberg atoms, providing essential groundwork toward next-generation radar systems featuring ultra-wide spectral agility, quantum-traceable calibration, and simplified architectures beyond traditional electronic front-ends.</description>

      <title>Continuously trapped matter-wave interferometry in magic Floquet-Bloch band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate a novel Floquet-engineered platform for compact, continuously trapped atom interferometry which is intrinsically robust against trap noise and beamsplitter pulse duration. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.</description>

      <title>Sturmian basis set for the Dirac equation with finite nuclear size: Application to polarizability, Zeeman and hyperfine splitting, and vacuum polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of the Sturmian basis set in relativistic atomic structure calculations. We propose a simple implementation of this approach and demonstrate its ability to provide various quantities for hydrogen-like ions, including binding energies, static dipole polarizability, $g$ factor, hyperfine splitting, and nuclear magnetic shielding. Finally, we calculate the all-order (Wichmann-Kroll) vacuum polarization charge density, which was a challenge for the finite-basis-set approach until recently. Comparison of the obtained results with the previously published numerical and analytical calculations is presented. All calculations are performed with the finite size of the nucleus and can in principle be extended to arbitrary binding potentials.</description>

      <title>Kilometer-Scale Ion-Photon Entanglement with a Metastable $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate entanglement between the polarization of an infrared photon and a metastable $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion qubit. This entanglement persists after transmitting the photon over a $2.8\:$km long commercial fiber deployed in an urban environment. Tomography of the ion-photon entangled state yields a fidelity of $0.949(4)$ within the laboratory and $0.929(5)$ after fiber transmission, not corrected for readout errors. Our results establish the Strontium ion as a promising candidate for metropolitan-scale quantum networking based on an atomic transition at $1092\:$nm, a wavelength compatible with existing telecom fiber infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Ray Optics Approach to Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieving the phase of a complex-valued field from the measurements of its amplitude is a crucial problem with a wide range of applications in microscopy and ultracold atomic physics. In particular, obtaining an accurate and efficient solution to this problem is a key step in shaping laser beams for trapping atoms in optical tweezer arrays and applying high-fidelity entangling gates on a neutral atom quantum computer. Current approaches to this problem fail to converge on the optimal solution due to a phenomenon known as vortex formation. In this work, we present an efficient optimization algorithm using Optimal Transport. Our approach completely bypasses the creation of phase vortices and allows for a state-of-the-art solution both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we show a deep theoretical connection between the Optimal Transport plan and the ray-optics limit of the Wigner distribution of the unknown complex-valued field, and show that our method can be used to retrieve the phase-space transformation of any unknown quadratic phase system. Finally, we reinterpret this problem in the modern quantum learning framework. The techniques we develop provide both useful intuition and practical tools for advancing the frontiers of phase retrieval and laser beam shaping.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions challenge conventional paradigms in many-body physics by separating phases that are locally indistinguishable yet globally distinct. Using a quantum simulator of interacting erbium atoms in an optical lattice, we observe such a transition between one-dimensional crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). We detect the critical point through non-local string order parameters and reveal its connection to the transition predicted between the Mott and Haldane insulators. Moreover, we demonstrate a striking property: stacking two identical systems eliminates the transition, confirming the predicted group structure and invertibility of SPTs. Finally, while introducing symmetry-breaking disorder also removes the transition, disorder averaging restores it. Consequently, the adjacent phases realize a form of mixed-state quantum order wherein the criticality between them depends on the observer's information. Our results demonstrate how topology and information influence quantum phase transitions, opening the doors to probing novel critical phenomena in programmable quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Universal gates for a metastable qubit in strontium-88</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable atomic qubits are a highly promising platform for the realization of quantum computers, owing to their scalability and the possibility of converting leakage errors to erasure errors mid-circuit. Here, we demonstrate and characterize a universal gate set for the metastable fine-structure qubit encoded between the $^3\text{P}_0$ and $^3\text{P}_2$ states in bosonic strontium-88. We find single-qubit gate fidelities of 0.993(1), and two-qubit gate fidelities of 0.9945(6) after correcting for losses during the gate operation. Furthermore, we present a novel state-resolved detection scheme for the two fine-structure states that enables high-fidelity detection of qubit loss. Finally, we leverage the existence of a stable ground state outside the qubit subspace to perform mid-circuit erasure conversion using fast destructive imaging. Our results establish the strontium fine-structure qubit as a promising candidate for near-term error-corrected quantum computers, offering unique scaling perspectives.</description>
