      <title>The solar cycle 25 multi-spacecraft solar energetic particle event catalog of the SERPENTINE project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar energetic particle analysis platform for the inner heliosphere (SERPENTINE) project presents it's new multi-spacecraft SEP event catalog for events observed in solar cycle 25. Observations from five different viewpoints are utilized, provided by Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, BepiColombo, and the near-Earth spacecraft Wind and SOHO. The catalog contains key SEP parameters for 25-40 MeV protons, 1 MeV electrons, and 100 keV electrons. Furthermore, basic parameters of the associated flare and type-II radio burst are listed, as well as the coordinates of the observer and solar source locations. SEP onset times are determined using the Poisson-CUSUM method. SEP peak times and intensities refer to the global intensity maximum. If different viewing directions are available, we use the one with the earliest onset for the onset determination and the one with the highest peak intensity for the peak identification. Associated flares are identified using observations from near Earth and Solar Orbiter. Associated type II radio bursts are determined from ground-based observations in the metric frequency range and from spacecraft observations in the decametric range. The current version of the catalog contains 45 multi-spacecraft events observed in the period from Nov 2020 until May 2023, of which 13 were widespread events and four were classified as narrow-spread events. Using X-ray observations by GOES/XRS and Solar Orbiter/STIX, we were able to identify the associated flare in all but four events. Using ground-based and space-borne radio observations, we found an associated type-II radio burst for 40 events. In total, the catalog contains 142 single event observations, of which 20 (45) have been observed at radial distances below 0.6 AU (0.8 AU).</description>

      <title>Towards Prebiotic Chemistry on Titan: Impact experiments on organic haze particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impacts are critical to producing the aqueous environments necessary to stimulate prebiotic chemistry on Titan's surface. Furthermore, organic hazes resting on the surface are a likely feedstock of biomolecules. In this work, we conduct impact experiments on laboratory-produced organic haze particles and haze/sand mixtures and analyze these samples for life's building blocks. Samples of unshocked haze and sand particles are also analyzed to determine the change in biomolecule concentrations and distributions from shocking. Across all samples, we detect seven nucleobases, nine proteinogenic amino acids, and five other biomolecules (e.g., urea) using a blank subtraction procedure to eliminate signals due to contamination. We find that shock pressures of 13 GPa variably degrade nucleobases, amino acids, and a few other organics in haze particles and haze/sand mixtures; however, certain individual biomolecules become enriched or are even produced from these events. Xanthine, threonine, and aspartic acid are enriched or produced in impact experiments containing sand, suggesting these minerals may catalyze the production of these biomolecules. On the other hand, thymine and isoleucine/norleucine are enriched or produced in haze samples containing no sand, suggesting catalytic grains are not necessary for all impact shock syntheses. Uracil, glycine, proline, cysteine, and tyrosine are the most unstable to impact-related processing. These experiments suggest that impacts alter biomolecule distributions on Titan's surface, and that organic hazes co-occurring with fine-grained material on the surface may provide an initial source for further prebiotic chemistry on Titan.</description>
