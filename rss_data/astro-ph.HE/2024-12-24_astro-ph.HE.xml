      <title>Electrodynamics and dissipation in the binary magnetosphere of pre-merger neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate energy release in the interacting magnetospheres of binary neutron stars (BNS) with global 3D force-free electrodynamics simulations. The system's behavior depends on the inclinations $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ of the stars' magnetic dipole moments relative to their orbital angular momentum. The simplest aligned configuration ($\chi_1=\chi_2=0^\circ$) has no magnetic field lines connecting the two stars. Remarkably, it still develops separatrix current sheets warping around each star and forms a dissipative region at the interface of the two magnetospheres. Dissipation at the interface is caused by a Kelvin-Helmholtz-type (KH) instability, which generates local Alfv\'enic turbulence and escaping fast magnetosonic waves. Binaries with inclined magnetospheres release energy in two ways: via KH instability at the interface and via magnetic reconnection flares in the twisted flux bundles connecting the two stars. The outgoing compressive waves can develop shocks and source fast radio bursts. We discuss implications for X-ray and radio precursors of BNS mergers.</description>

      <title>Kilonova ejecta opacity inferred from new large-scale HFR atomic calculations in all elements between Ca (Z = 20) and Lr (Z = 103)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of kilonova (KN) modeling, the present work focusses on large-scale atomic data and opacity computations for all heavy elements from Ca to Lr, with a special effort on lanthanides and actinides, for a grid of typical KN ejecta conditions between one day and one week after the merger (corresponding to the LTE photosphere phase of the KN ejecta). In order to do so, we used the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock (HFR) method, in which the choice of the interaction configuration model is of crucial importance. In this paper, HFR atomic data and opacities for all elements between Ca (Z = 20) and Lr (Z = 103) are presented, with a special focus on lanthanides and actinides. Besides, we also discuss the contribution of every single element to the total KN ejecta opacity for a given neutron star merger model, depending on their Planck mean opacities and elemental abundances. An important result is that lanthanides are found to not be the dominant sources of opacity, at least on average. The impact on KN light curves of considering such atomic-physics based opacity data instead of typical crude approximation formulae is also evaluated. In addition, the importance of taking the ejecta composition into account directly in the expansion opacity determination (instead of estimating single-element opacities) is highlighted. A database containing all the relevant atomic data and opacity tables has also been created and published online along with this work.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray spectra and anisotropy under anisotropic propagation model with spiral galactic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we have investigated Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spectra and anisotropy from 100 GeV to PeV, under anisotropic propagation model with axisymmetric distributed galactic sources. Numerous observational evidence have indicated that the Milky Way is a typical spiral galaxy. In this work, we further utilize anisotropic propagation models with spiral galactic sources to investigate spectra and anisotropy of CRs. During the calculation process, we employ the spatially dependent diffusion (SDP) model with different diffusion coefficients for the inner and outer halo, while the background CR sources is spiral distribution. To better explain the anomalous observations of nuclear spectral hardening at $ {\cal R}\sim$ 200 GV and the complicated energy dependence of anisotropy from GeV to PeV, we introduce the contribution of the Geminga nearby source. Additionally, we incorporate the impact of the local regular magnetic field (LRMF) and the corresponding anisotropic diffusion on large-scale anisotropy within the SDP model. By comparing the spiral and axisymmetric distribution models of background sources, it is found that both of them can well reproduce the CR spectra and anisotropy from 100 GeV-PeV. However, their propagation parameters are different. The diffusion coefficient with spiral distribution of CR sources is larger than that with axisymmetric distribution, and its spectral indices are also harder. Future high-precision measurements of CR anisotropy, such as LHAASO experiment, will be crucial in evaluating the validity of our proposed model.</description>

      <title>Prospect of GRB-Neutrino Detection with Enhanced Neutrino Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been proposed as a potential source of high-energy neutrinos. Although no confirmed association between GRBs and neutrinos has been established, meaningful constraints have been placed on GRB prompt emission models. The non-detection of neutrinos, reported by the IceCube collaboration, from both single and stacked GRB events suggests that the radiation zone is likely located at a considerable distance from the central engine, where the photon number density is relatively low. Here, we estimate future GRB-neutrino detection probabilities with more sensitive detectors than IceCube and explore the constraints on models if GRB neutrinos remain undetected despite improved sensitivity. Our findings reveal that if the effective area of a future neutrino detector can be enhanced by a factor of 10 compared to IceCube IC86-II, there is a high likelihood of detecting neutrinos from a GRB 221009A-like event, even in the context of the ICMART model, which exhibits the lowest efficiency in neutrino production. With such an advanced detector (enhanced by a factor of 10) and 5 to 10 years of data accumulation, neutrinos from stacked GRBs should be identifiable, or several popular models for GRB prompt emission (e.g., the dissipative photosphere model and internal shock model) could be effectively ruled out.</description>

      <title>The changing-look AGN SDSS J101152.98+544206.4 is returning to a type I state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We reported the discovery that a changing-look AGN SDSS J101152.98+544206.4 (J1011+5442 for short) gradually returns to the type 1 state after a short period between 2014 and 2019 in the faint type 1.9 state. Methods. Motivated by the rebrightening in optical and mid-infrared light curves from ZTF and WISE, we obtained the new spectroscopic observations by Xinglong 2.16-m, Lijiang 2.4-m, and MMT 6.5-m optical telescopes in 2024. Results. After changing the optical AGN type from 1 to 1.9 between 2003 and 2015 based on the repeat spectroscopy from the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey, J1011+5442 returns to its type 1 state in 2024. We detect the significant and very broad Hbeta lines (FWHM &gt; 5000 km/s) based on the new spectra, which suggests that J1011+5442 is in the intermediate state between the dim state in 2015 and the bright state in 2003. The long-term optical and mid-infrared light curves also show a brightening trend between 2019 and 2024 as the broad Hbeta line appears. The time lag of about 100 days between the mid-infrared and optical variability is consistent with the prediction of dust reverberation mapping. Conclusions. The behaviors of the photometric and spectroscopic observations of J1011+5442 are consistent with the argument that the repeating changing-look phenomenon is regulated by the variation of accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Transonic accretion flow in the mini discs of a binary black hole system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the general relativistic transonic accretion flow around the primary black hole, which forms the circumprimary disc (CPD), within a BBH system. The BBH spacetime is characterized by the mass ratio ($q$) and the separation distance ($z_2$) between the two black holes. We numerically solve the radial momentum and energy equations to obtain the accretion solutions. It is observed that the CPD can exhibit shock solutions, which exist for a wide range parameter space spanned by flow angular momentum ($\lambda$) and energy ($E$). We find that the shock parameter space is modified by $q$ and $z_2$. Investigations show that $q$ and $z_2$ also affect various shock properties, such as density compression and temperature compression across the shock fronts. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the CPD and examine how the SEDs are modified by $q$ and $z_2$ for both shock-free and shock-induced accretion solutions. SED is found to be nearly independent of the binary parameters. We depict that the mutual interaction between two black holes in a binary system hardly alters their individual accretion features. This study replicates the existing predictions in a different context of binary accretion.</description>

      <title>Model-independent dark matter detection with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for annihilating dark matter are often designed with a specific dark matter candidate in mind. However, the space of potential dark matter models is vast, which raises the question: how can we search for dark matter without making strong assumptions about unknown physics. We present a model-independent approach for measuring dark matter annihilation ratios and branching fractions with $\gamma$-ray event data. By parameterizing the annihilation ratios for seven different channels, we obviate the need to search for a specific dark matter candidate. To demonstrate our approach, we analyse simulated data using the \texttt{GammaBayes} pipeline. Given a 5$\sigma$ signal, we reconstruct the annihilation ratios for five dominant channels to within 95% credibility. This allows us to reconstruct dark matter annihilation/decay channels without presuming any particular model, thus offering a model-independent approach to indirect dark matter searches in $\gamma$-ray astronomy. This approach shows that for masses between 0.3-5 TeV we can probe values below the thermal relic velocity annihilation weighted cross-section allowing a 2$\sigma$ detection for 525 hours of simulated observation data by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory of the Galactic Centre.</description>

      <title>The Quest for the Origins of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made over the past decades towards unveiling the sources of the most energetic particles in nature, the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Despite these advancements, the exact astrophysical sites capable of accelerating these particles to such extreme energies remain largely unknown. Moreover, the mechanisms by which they achieve these extreme energies are poorly understood. Here, I provide a concise overview of the theory underlying the acceleration and propagation of UHECRs. I then critically discuss three recent results that could help unveil their origins: the reported excess around Centaurus A, the correlation with starburst galaxies, and the efforts to jointly model the energy spectrum, composition, and arrival directions. Finally, I discuss strategies for advancing this field, emphasising the need for refined theoretical models, the challenges in building them, and the potential for new observatories to shed light on the mysteries of UHECRs.</description>

Abstract: Accreting X-ray pulsars, located in X-ray binaries, are neutron stars with magnetic fields as strong as $B\sim10^{12\text{--}13}$ G. This review offers a concise overview of the accretion and radiation processes of X-ray pulsars and summarizes their rich observational features, particularly focusing on complex and variable temporal phenomena, spectral properties, and evolution, the new window for X-ray polarimetry and multi-wavelength advances. We also briefly discuss other related systems, i.e., gamma-ray binaries and pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Analysing Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays' Anisotropy in $\boldsymbol{f(R, T)}$ Gravity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the anisotropy of diffusive Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) by employing three cosmological models: two models from the $f(R, T)$ gravity theory and the other is the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The primary objective of this work was to ascertain the role of the $f(R, T)$ gravity theory in comprehending the anisotropy of UHECRs without implicitly endorsing the conventional cosmology. We parameterized the magnetic field and the source distance in anisotropy calculations to align well with the observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory for all the cosmological models. An uncertainty band is presented along with the $\chi^2$ test for all cosmological models to demonstrate the goodness of fitting. Our findings revealed that the amplitude of the anisotropy is highly sensitive to these cosmological models. Notably, the $f(R, T)$ models exhibited a lower amplitude of anisotropy (i.e., more isotropy), while the $\Lambda$CDM model predicted a comparatively higher amplitude at most of the energies considered.</description>

      <title>Spectra for Reactions in Astrophysical Electromagnetic Cascades with Lorentz Invariance Violation: The Vacuum Cherenkov Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation is a feature of several quantum gravity models in which Lorentz symmetry is broken at high energies, leading to potential changes in particle behavior and interactions. In this study, we investigate vacuum Cherenkov radiation, a reaction in which an electron spontaneously emits a photon. This process, forbidden when considering unbroken Lorentz symmetry, is a phenomenological consequence of some quantum gravity models. We derive, for the first time, the spectra for the vacuum Cherenkov reaction, and confirm our results numerically. These results can be used to derive limits on Lorentz invariance violation.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Population of Gamma-Ray Bursts from the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the discovery of gravitational waves (GWs), the disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have emerged as an interesting environment for hosting a fraction of their sources. AGN disks are conducive to forming both long and short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and their anticipated cosmological occurrence within these disks has potential to serve as an independent tool for probing and calibrating the population of stars and compact objects within them, and their contribution to the GW-detected population. In this study, we employ Monte Carlo methods in conjunction with models for GRB electromagnetic emission in extremely dense media to simulate the cosmological occurrence of both long and short GRBs within AGN disks, while also estimating their detectability across a range of wavelengths, from gamma-rays to radio frequencies. {We investigate two extreme scenarios: ``undiffused", in which the radiation escapes without significant scattering (i.e. if the progenitor has excavated a funnel within the disk), and ``diffused", in which the radiation is propagated through the high-density medium, potentially scattered and absorbed. {In the diffused case,} we find that the majority of detectable GRBs are likely to originate from relatively low redshifts, and from the outermost regions of large supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, $\gtrsim 10^{7.5} \rm M_{\odot}$. In the undiffused case, we expect a similar trend, but with a considerable contribution from the intermediate regions of lower SMBH masses. Detectable emission is generally expected to be dominant in prompt $\gamma$-rays if diffusion is not dominant, and X-ray afterglow if diffusion is important; however, the nature of the dominant observable signal highly depends on the specific AGN disk model, hence making GRBs in AGN disks also potential probes of the structure of the disks themselves.</description>

      <title>Warped accretion disks and quasars with episodic periodicity of long-term variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been found that some quasars are undergoing quasi-periodic variations (most of them with damped amplitudes) in optical bands from long-term monitoring campaigns, but how to explain the origin of such light curve variations still remains an open question. In this paper, we use the warped accretion disks model to explain the quasi-periodical variations. This model employs a free-bending wave traveling in an accretion disk which causes the orientation of the central part of the disk to oscillate from the line of sight, resulting in a quasi-periodical variation. We numerically solve the governing equation of warp propagation and calculate the simulated R-band light curves, finding that the periodical light curves generated by this model have damped amplitudes. To compare with observations, we select SDSSJ134820.42+194831.5 as a preliminary example from a sample of periodic quasar candidates by combining CRTS with other public survey data, and fitted its light curve with different observational angles. Our result gives a reduced $\chi^{2}\simeq 2.4$, implying that the model might give insights to future application of warped disk model.</description>

      <title>Glitch-induced pulse profile change of PSR J0742-2822 observed from the IAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio pulsar PSR J0742-2822 is known to exhibit rapid changes between different pulse profile states that correlate with changes in its spin-down rate. However, the connection between these variations and the glitch activity of the pulsar remains unclear. We aim to study the evolution of the pulse profile and spin-down rate of PSR J0742-2822 in the period MJD 58810-60149 (November 2019 to July 2023), which includes the glitch on MJD 59839 (September 2022). In particular, we look for pulse profile or spin-down changes associated with the 2022 glitch. We observed PSR J0742-2822 with high cadence from the Argentine Institute of Radio astronomy (IAR) between November 2019 and July 2023. We used standard timing tools to characterize the times of arrival of the pulses and study the pulsar rotation, and particularly, the oscillations of $\dot \nu$. We also study the evolution of the pulse profile. For both of them, we compare their behavior before and after the 2022 glitch. With respect to $\dot \nu$, we found oscillations diminished in amplitude after the glitch. We found four different components contributing to the pre-glitch $\dot \nu$ oscillations, and only one component after the glitch. About the emission, we found the pulse profile has two main peaks. We detected an increase in the $W_{50}$ of the total pulse profile of $\sim$12% after the glitch and we found the amplitude of the trailing peak increased with respect to the amplitude of the leading one after the glitch. We found significant changes in the pulse profile and the spin-down rate of PSR J0742-2822 after its 2022 glitch. These results suggest that there is a strong coupling between the internal superfluid of the neutron star and its magnetosphere, and that pulse profile changes may be led by this coupling instead of being led purely by magnetospheric effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arcus Probe mission concept provides high-resolution soft X-ray and UV spectroscopy to reveal feedback-driven structure and evolution throughout the universe with an agile response capability ideal for probing the physics of time-dependent phenomena. The X-ray Spectrograph (XRS) utilizes two nearly identical CCD focal planes to detect and record X-ray photons from the dispersed spectra and zero-order of the critical angle transmission gratings. In this paper we describe the Arcus focal plane instrument and the CCDs, including laboratory performance results, which meet observatory requirements.</description>

      <title>Fast frequency-domain gravitational waveforms for precessing binaries with a new twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waveform (GW) models are a core ingredient for the analysis of compact binary mergers observed by current ground-based interferometers. We focus here on a specific class of such models known as PhenomX, which has gained popularity in recent years thanks to its computational efficiency. We introduce a new description of the ``twisting-up'' mapping underpinning the construction of precessing waveforms within this family. The new description is an adaptation to the frequency domain of a technique previously implemented in time-domain models, where the orbit-averaged post-Newtonian spin-precession dynamics is numerically solved on the fly. We also present an improved version of the gravitational-wave strain amplitudes approximating the signal in the co-precessing frame. We demonstrate that the new description yields improved matches against numerical relativity simulations, with only a modest computational overhead. We also show that the new model can be reliably employed in parameter estimation follow-ups of GW events, returning equivalent or more stringent measurements of the source properties compared to its predecessor.</description>

      <title>A central tidal disruption event candidate in high redshift quasar SDSS J000118.70+003314.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a high-redshift ($z=1.404$) tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate in SDSS J000118.70+003314.0 (SDSS J0001), which is a quasar with apparent broad Mg~{\sc ii} emission line. The long-term variability in its nine-year photometric $ugriz$-band light curves, obtained from the SDSS Stripe82 and the PHOTOOBJALL databases, can be described by the conventional TDE model. Our results suggest that the TDE is a main-sequence star with mass of $1.905_{-0.009}^{+0.023}{\rm M_\odot}$ tidally disrupted by a black hole (BH) with mass {$6.5_{-2.6}^{+3.5}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$}. The BH mass is about 7.5 times smaller than the virial BH mass derived from the broad Mg~{\sc ii} emission line, which can be explained by non-virial dynamic properties of broad emission lines from TDEs debris. Furthermore, we examine the probability that the event results from intrinsic variability of quasars, which is about $0.009\%$, through applications of the DRW/CAR process. Alternative explanations for the event are also discussed, such as the scenarios of dust obscurations, microlensing and accretion. Our results provide clues to support that TDEs could be detectable in broad line quasars as well as in quiescent galaxies, and to indicate the variability of some active galactic nuclei may be partly attributed to central TDEs.</description>

      <title>No Glitch in the Matrix: Robust Reconstruction of Gravitational Wave Signals Under Noise Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations by ground based detectors such as LIGO and Virgo have transformed astrophysics, enabling the study of compact binary systems and their mergers. However, transient noise artifacts, or glitches, pose a significant challenge, often obscuring or mimicking signals and complicating their analysis. In this work, we extend the Attention-boosted Waveform Reconstruction network to address glitch mitigation, demonstrating its robustness in reconstructing waveforms in the presence of real glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. Without requiring explicit training on glitches, AWaRe accurately isolates gravitational wave signals from data contaminated by glitches spanning a wide range of amplitudes and morphologies. We evaluate this capability by investigating the events GW191109 and GW200129, which exhibit strong evidence of anti-aligned spins and spin precession respectively, but may be adversely affected by data quality issues. We find that, regardless of the potential presence of glitches in the data, AWaRe reconstructs both waveforms with high accuracy. Additionally, we perform a systematic study of the performance of AWaRe on a simulated catalog of injected waveforms in real LIGO glitches and obtain reliable reconstructions of the waveforms. By subtracting the AWaRe reconstructions from the data, we show that the resulting residuals closely align with the background noise that the waveforms were injected in. The robustness of AWaRe in mitigating glitches, despite being trained exclusively on GW signals and not explicitly on glitches, highlights its potential as a powerful tool for improving the reliability of searches and characterizing noise artifacts.</description>

Abstract: X-ray Astrophysics, which addresses extreme physics in extreme conditions, is particularly well suited for answering questions related to known physics. Reversely tiny effects, but integrated along sidereal distances, allow to probe extensions of known physics or even new physics. The new window into polarimetry in this energy band, opened by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) a NASA-ASI Small Explorer mission launched on 9th December 2021 enables an entirely novel approach, whether used alone or in combination with standard observables such as light curves and spectra and with data in other wavelengths. In this paper, we review IXPE's results after nearly three years of successful operation, focusing on their implications for key questions in Fundamental Physics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a first-order phase transition of the inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the production of gravitational waves (GW) resulting from a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in a non-minimally coupled `Dark Higgs Inflation' model. Utilizing a dark sector scalar field as the inflaton, we demonstrate how inflationary dynamics naturally set the stage for observable FOPT. These transitions, influenced by thermal and quantum effects, generate GW spectra potentially detectable by observatories such as LISA, DECIGO, the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our study highlights the inflaton's dual role in cosmic inflation and early Universe phase transitions, presenting a unified framework to probe physics beyond the Standard Model through gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Unique Helium Nova V445 Puppis Ejected $\gg$0.001 M$_{\odot}$ in the Year 2000 and Will Not Become a Type Ia Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V445 Puppis is the only known example of a helium nova, where a layer of helium-rich gas accretes onto the surface of a white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable, with runaway helium burning making for the nova event. Speculatively, helium nova can provide one path to produce a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), within the larger framework of single-degenerate models. Relatively little has been known about V445 Pup, with this work reporting the discovery of the orbital period near 1.87 days. The companion star is 2.65$\pm$0.35 R$_{\odot}$ in radius as an evolved giant star stripped of its outer hydrogen envelope. The orbital period immediately before the 2000 eruption was $P_{\rm pre}$=1.871843$\pm$0.000014 days, with a steady period change of (-0.17$\pm$0.06)$\times$10$^{-8}$ from 1896--1995. The period immediately after the nova eruption was $P_{\rm post}$=1.873593$\pm$0.000034 days, with a $\dot{P}$ of ($-$4.7$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-8}$. The fractional orbital period change ($\Delta P/P$) is $+$935$\pm$27 ppm. This restricts the mass of the gases ejected in the nova eruption to be $\gg$0.001M$_{\odot}$, and much greater than the mass accreted to trigger the nova. So the white dwarf is losing mass over each eruption cycle, and will not become a SNIa. Further, for V445 Pup and helium novae in general, I collect observations from 136 normal SNIa, for which any giant or sub-giant companion star would have been detected, yet zero companions are found. This is an independent proof that V445 Pup and helium novae are not SNIa progenitors.</description>

      <title>A Search for Radio Millisecond Pulsar Companions around Extremely Low-mass White Dwarfs with Ellipsoidal Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely low-mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs) are helium-core white dwarfs with masses less than 0.3 $M_{\odot}$. Short-period ELM WD binaries that exhibit ellipsoidal variations may harbor heavier companions, either massive white dwarfs or millisecond pulsars (MSPs). In this study, we selected $\sim$ 12,000 ELM WDs or their candidates, and searched for ellipsoidal-like lightcurves with orbital periods shorter than one day, by using the public data from Zwicky Transient Facility. Finally 23 such systems were found, with 17 being newly discovered. We selected nine high-priority targets likely to evolve from the Roche-lobe overflow channel and estimated their companion masses from the extracted ellipsoidal variation amplitude. Among them, the four targets have companion masses exceeding 1 $M_{\odot}$. We performed a search for radio pulsations from six of these targets by using Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. However, no convincing radio pulsed signals were found, resulting in upper limits for the radio flux at around 8 $\mu$Jy. Given the non-detection of radio pulsations from a total of 11 similar systems, the fraction of ellipsoidal ELM WDs around MSPs is estimated to be below 15$^{+6}_{-3}$%. We anticipate that multi-wavelength studies of more ellipsoidal-like ELM WDs will further constrain the fraction.</description>

      <title>Bulge Oscillation Driven by Outflows of Active Galactic Nuclei. I. Fast Outflow Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence for star formation inside outflows of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The formed stars are injected into bulges and give rise to perturbation of bulges. In this paper, we investigate the issues of non-rotating, spherically symmetric bulges under the perturbation of fast, massive outflows with stars formed inside. We show that the potential perturbation of outflows together with injection and dynamical friction of these stars could drive bulge oscillations. Still, we find non-zero radial velocity of bulges will be driven by the episodic outflows of AGNs and after the AGN quenched, the radial velocity will tend to zero within a timescale $\sim\tau_{\rm AGN}$, which is the AGN's lifetime. For some typical values of bulges and AGNs, we find the expansion and contraction velocities are of a few $10\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ for $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ bulges and mass outflowing rate $500\,M_\odot/\rm yr$, which would give observational signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matter properties at the intermediate densities are still unknown to us. In this work, we use a neural network approach to study matter at intermediate densities to analyze the variation of the speed of sound and the measure of trace anomaly considering astrophysical constraints of mass-radius measurement of 18 neutron stars. Our numerical results show that there is a sharp rise in the speed of sound just beyond the saturation energy density. It attains a peak around $3-4$ times the saturation energy density and, after that, decreases. This hints towards the appearance of new degrees of freedom and smooth transition from hadronic matter in massive stars. The trace anomaly is maximum at low density (surface of the stars) and decreases as we reach high density. It approaches zero and can even be slightly negative at the centre of massive stars. It has a negative trough beyond the maximal central densities of neutron stars. The change in sign of the trace anomaly hints towards a near-conformal matter at the centre of neutron stars, which may not necessarily be conformal quark matter.</description>

      <title>Reexamining constraints on neutron star properties from perturbative QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11125v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The implications of perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations on neutron stars are carefully examined. While pQCD calculations above baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B\simeq2.4$ GeV demonstrate the potential of ruling out a wide range of neutron star equations of state (EOSs), such constraints only affect the most massive neutron stars in the vicinity of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, resulting in constraints that are orthogonal to current or expected astrophysical bounds. In the most constraining scenario, pQCD considerations favor low values of the squared speed sound $C_s$ at high $\mu_B$ relevant for the most massive neutron stars, but leave predictions of the radii and tidal deformabilities almost unchanged. Such considerations become irrelevant if the maximum speed of sound squared inside neutron stars does not exceed about $C_{s,\mathrm{max}}\simeq0.5$, or if pQCD breaks down below $\mu_B\simeq2.9$ GeV. Furthermore, the large pQCD uncertainties preclude any meaningful bounds on the neutron star EOS at the moment. Interestingly, if pQCD predictions for the pressure at around $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV are refined and found to be low ($\lesssim 1.5$ GeV/fm$^3$), evidence for a soft neutron star inner core EOS in combination with the existence of two-solar-mass pulsars would indicate the presence of color superconductivity beyond neutron star densities. We point out that two-solar-mass pulsars place robust upper bounds on this non-perturbative effect and require the pairing gap to be less than $\Delta_\mathrm{CFL}\lesssim500$ MeV at $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Observed Trends in FRB Population and Bi-modality in their Peak Luminosity Density Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio transients of extragalactic origin lasting for about a few to several milli-seconds. We have analyzed both non-CHIME and CHIME FRB data. To circumvent the absence of measured fluence and flux density of FRBs belonging to the CHIME catalog, we have devised a novel approach that utilizes the ratio of the lower limits of the flux density $S_{\nu_O}$ to the fluence $F_{\nu_O}$ of individual FRB events to construct several parameters to investigate the presence of underlying trends in the FRB population drawn from both CHIME and non-CHIME data sets. One of these parameters involves true brightness temperature as well as energy density, despite not knowing the actual size of the FRB emission region. Our first robust conclusion is that the non-CHIME FRBs fall under two broad categories - those with luminosity density less than about $4\times 10^{33} $ erg/s/Hz at the frequency 300 MHz and those having larger luminosity density values than this. Assuming that FRBs are caused by magnetar glitches, we have discussed in this paper a simple physical model, incorporating an abrupt change in the light cylinder radius of an oblique rotator, to address the existence of these two categories.</description>

Abstract: General relativistic corrections are calculated for the quadrupole moment of a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting neutron star. The hydromagnetic structure of the mountain satisfies the general relativistic Grad-Shafranov equation supplemented by the flux-freezing condition of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, as in previous calculations of the magnetic dipole moment. It is found that the ellipticity and hence the gravitational wave strain are up to $12\%$ greater than in the analogous Newtonian system. The direct contribution of the magnetic field to the nonaxisymmetric component of the stress-energy tensor is shown to be negligible in accreting systems such as low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Towards Searching for Photons with Energies beyond the PeV Range from Galactic PeVatrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several gamma-ray observatories have discovered photons of cosmic origin with energies in the PeV ($10^{15}\,\text{eV}$) range. Photons at these energies might be produced as by-products from particle acceleration in so-called PeVatrons, which are widely assumed to be the sources of a large part of galactic cosmic rays. Based on recent measurements of these PeV $\gamma$-sources by LHAASO and HAWC, we extrapolate the energy spectra of selected sources up to the ultra-high-energy (UHE, ${\geq}10\,\text{PeV}$) regime. The goal of this study is to evaluate if (and under what conditions) giant air-shower observatories, for example the Pierre Auger Observatory, could contribute to testing the UHE luminosity of PeV $\gamma$-sources. Possible propagation effects are investigated as well as the required discrimination power to distinguish photon- and hadron-initiated air showers. For present detector setups, it turns out to be challenging to achieve the required sensitivity due to the energy threshold being too high or the detection area too small. Dedicated detector concepts appear to be needed to explore the UHE frontier. Ultimately, this could provide complementary information on the sources of cosmic rays beyond the PeV regime -- a key objective of current efforts in multimessenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Physics-driven Explosions of Stripped High-Mass Stars: Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra of Stripped-Envelope Supernovae with Broad Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) represent a significant fraction of core-collapse supernovae, arising from massive stars that have shed their hydrogen and, in some cases, helium envelopes. The origins and explosion mechanisms of SESNe remain a topic of active investigation. In this work, we employ radiative-transfer simulations to model the light curves and spectra of a set of explosions of single, solar-metallicity, massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars with ejecta masses ranging from 4 to 11 Msun, that were computed from a turbulence-aided and neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. We analyze these synthetic observables to explore the impact of varying ejecta mass and helium content on observable features. We find that the light curve shape of these progenitors with high ejecta masses is consistent with observed SESNe with broad light curves but not the peak luminosities. The commonly used analytic formula based on rising bolometric light curves overestimates the ejecta mass of these high-initial-mass progenitor explosions by a factor up to 2.6. In contrast, the calibrated method by Haynie et al., which relies on late-time decay tails, reduces uncertainties to an average of 20% within the calibrated ejecta mass range.Spectroscopically, the He I 1.083 um line remains prominent even in models with as little as 0.02 Msun of helium. However, the strength of the optical He I lines is not directly proportional to the helium mass but instead depends on a complex interplay of factors such as 56Ni distribution, composition, and radiation field. Thus, producing realistic helium features requires detailed radiative transfer simulations for each new hydrodynamic model.</description>

      <title>X-ray properties of coronal emission in radio quiet Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powerful sources of panchromatic radiation. All AGN emit in X-rays, contributing around $\sim 5-10\%$ of the AGN bolometric luminosity. The X-ray emitting region, popularly known as the corona, is geometrically and radiatively compact with a size typically $\lesssim 10 \, R_{\rm G}$ (gravitational radii). The rapid and extreme variability in X-rays also suggest that the corona must be a dynamic structure. Decades of X-ray studies have shed much light on the topic, but the nature and origin of AGN corona are still not clearly understood. This is mostly due to the complexities involved in several physical processes at play in the high-gravity, high-density and high-temperature region in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). It is still not clear how exactly the corona is energetically and physically sustained near a SMBH. The ubiquity of coronal emission in AGN points to their fundamental role in black hole accretion processes. In this review we discuss the X-ray observational properties of corona in radio quiet AGN.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation and muon production in ultra-high energy cosmic ray particle collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisions of cosmic ray particles with ultra-high initial energies with nuclei in the atmosphere open a wide room for appearing of the novel dynamical features for multiparticle production processes. In particular, the pion-lasing behavior driven by Bose-Einstein condensation would result in the shift to larger multiplicities and, as consequence, could provide, in general, the enhanced yield of cosmic muons. In the present work the critical value of the space charged particle density for onset of Bose-Einstein condensation of the boson (pion) wave-packets into the same wave-packet state is estimated within the model with complete multiparticle symmetrization for the energy domain corresponded to the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR). Energy dependence of mean density of charged pions is evaluated for the cases of absent of the Bose-Einstein effects and for presence of laser-like behavior of pions. The possible influence of the Bose-Einstein condensation is discussed for the muon production in UHECR particle collisions with the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Numerical viscosity and resistivity in MHD turbulence simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes early inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signals, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5% the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.48 $M_{\odot}$ and a relative error precision of 0.12.</description>

      <title>Local two-dimensional simulations of the ignition of a helium shell detonation on a white dwarf by an impacting stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The double detonation model is one of the prevalent explosion mechanisms of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) wherein an outer helium shell detonation triggers a core detonation in the white dwarf (WD). The dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) is the double detonation of the more massive WD in a binary WD system where the localized impact of the mass transfer stream from the companion sets off the initial helium shell detonation. To have high numerical resolution and control over the stream parameters, we have implemented a study of the local interaction of the stream with the WD surface in 2D. In cases with lower base density of the shell, the stream's impact can cause surface detonation soon after first impact. With higher base densities, after the stream hits the surface, hot material flows around the star and interacts with the incoming stream to produce a denser and narrower impact. Our results therefore show that (1) a directly impacting stream for both a relatively high resolution and for a range of stream parameters can produce a surface detonation, (2) thinner helium shells ignite more promptly via impact, doing so sooner, and (3) there are lower limits on ignition in both shell density and incoming stream speed with lower limits on density being well below those shown by other work to be required for normal appearing SN Ia. This supports stream ignition and therefore the D6 scenario, as a viable mechanism for normal SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of The Brightest Nano-size Gamma Source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma rays selectively interact with nuclei, induce and mediate nuclear reactions and elementary particle interactions, and exceed x-rays in penetrating power and thus are indispensable for analysis and modification of dense objects. Yet, the available gamma sources lack sufficient power and brightness. The predicted and highly desirable laser-driven gamma flash, from here on termed "Gamma Flash", based on inverse Compton scattering from solid targets at extreme irradiances (&gt;$10^{23}W/cm^2$), would be the highest-power and the brightest terrestrial gamma source with a 30-40% laser-to-gamma energy conversion. However, Gamma Flash remains inaccessible experimentally due to the Bremsstrahlung background. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new interaction regime at the highest effective irradiance where Gamma Flash scaled quickly with the laser power and produced several times the number of Bremsstrahlung photons. Simulations revealed an attosecond, Terawatt Gamma Flash with a nanometre source size achieving a record brightness exceeding $~10^{23}photons/mm^2mrad^2s$ per 0.1% bandwidth at tens of MeV photon energies, surpassing astrophysical Gamma Ray Bursts. These findings could revolutionize inertial fusion energy by enabling unprecedented sub-micrometre/femtosecond resolution radiography of fuel mixing instabilities in extremely-compressed targets. The new gamma source could facilitate significant advances in time-resolved nuclear physics, homeland security, nuclear waste management and non-proliferation, while opening possibilities for spatially-coherent gamma rays.</description>

      <title>Fast optical variability in Supergiant X-ray binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to investigate the fast photometric variability of the optical counterparts to supergiant X-ray binaries and to compare the general patterns of such variability with the Galactic population of other early-type stars. We analyzed a sample of 14 high-mass X-ray binaries with supergiant companions observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and 4 Be/X-ray binaries with persistent X-ray emission for comparison. All sources exhibit fast aperiodic light variations. The shape of the periodogram is well described by a red noise component at intermediate frequencies ($\sim 1-10$ d$^{-1}$). At lower frequencies the noise level flattens while at higher frequencies the periodogram is dominated by white noise. We find that the patterns of variability of the massive companions in supergiant X-ray binaries agree with that of single early-type evolved stars in terms of the general shape of the periodograms. However, they exhibit higher amplitude at low frequencies and lower characteristic frequencies than Be/X-ray binaries. Unlike Be/X-ray binaries, supergiant X-ray binaries exhibit a total lack of coherent signals at high frequencies. Most sources have been analyzed over multiple TESS sectors, spanning a duration of 4 years. We do not find any significant variation over time in the low-frequency variability characteristics. This study reveals that stochastic low-frequency variability is a very common, if not ubiquitous, feature intrinsic to supergiant optical companions in X-ray binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD phase transition and its phase structure within Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar system and compare the results with those obtained from the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton system. It is shown that both models reproduce behavior consistent with lattice QCD. In particular, the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar system exhibits a first-order phase transition in the pure gauge sector, aligning with predictions from Yang-Mills theory. Based on these models, we construct a holographic model for neutron stars, incorporating leptons to satisfy electric charge neutrality, and examine the cold equation of state, the mass-radius relation, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. It is demonstrated that the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar system enables us to describe neutron star properties that meet current astrophysical constraints.</description>
