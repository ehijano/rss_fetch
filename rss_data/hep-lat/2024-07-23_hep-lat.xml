      <title>Lattice study of SU(2) gauge theory coupled to four adjoint Higgs fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge theories with matter fields in various representations play an important role in different branches of physics. Recently, it was proposed that several aspects of the interesting pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors near optimal doping may be explained by an emergent $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. Around the transition with positive hole-doping, one can construct a $(2+1)-$dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory coupled to four adjoint scalar fields which gives rise to a rich phase diagram with a myriad of phases having different broken symmetries. We study the phase diagram of this model on the Euclidean lattice using the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We find the existence of multiple broken phases as predicted by previous mean field studies. Depending on the quartic couplings, the $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is broken down either to $U(1)$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the perturbative description of the model. We further study the confinement-deconfinement transition in this theory, and find that both the broken phases are deconfining. However, there exists a marked difference in the behavior of the Polyakov loop between the two phases.</description>

      <title>Triply charm and bottom tetraquarks in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the singly, doubly and fully charmed tetraquark candidates, $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$, $T^+_{cc}(3875)$ and $X(6900)$ are experimentally reported by the LHCb collaboration. Hence, it is quite necessary to implement a theoretical investigation on the triply heavy tetrquarks. In this study, the S-wave triply charm and bottom tetraquarks, $\bar{Q}Q\bar{q}Q$ $(q=u,\,d,\,s;\,Q=c,\,b)$, with spin-parity $J^P=0^+$, $1^+$ and $2^+$, isospin $I=0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ are systematically studied in a constituent quark model. Particularly, a complete S-wave tetraquark configurations, which include the meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and K-type arrangements of quarks, along with all allowed color structures, are comprehensively considered. A high accuracy and efficient computational approach, the Gaussian expansion method (GEM), in cooperation with a powerful complex-scaling method (CSM), which is quite ingenious in dealing with the bound and resonant state of a multiquark system simultaneously, are adopted in solving the complex scaled Schr\"odinger equation. This theoretical framework has already been successfully applied in various tetra- and penta-quark systems. Bound state of triply heavy tetraquark system is unavailable in our study, nevertheless, in a fully coupled-channel calculation by the CSM, several narrow resonances are found in each $I(J^P)$ quantum states of the charm and bottom sector. In particular, triply charm and bottom tetraquark resonances are obtained in $5.59-5.94$ GeV and $15.31-15.67$ GeV, respectively. Compositeness of exotic states, such as the inner quark distance, magnetic moment and dominant component, are also analyzed. These exotic hadrons in triply heavy sector are expected to be confirmed in future high energy experiments.</description>

      <title>Heavy four-quark mesons $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$: Scalar particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameters of the heavy four-quark scalar meson $T_{\mathrm{2bc}}=bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are calculated by means of the sum rule method. This structure is considered as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark and antidiquark components. The mass and current coupling of $T_{ \mathrm{2bc}}$ are evaluated in the context of the two-point sum rule approach. The full width of this tetraquark is estimated by taking into account two types of its possible strong decay channels. First class includes dissociation of $T_{\mathrm{2bc}}$ to mesons $\eta_c\eta_{b}$, $ B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$, $B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $ B_{c}^{+}(1^3P_{0})B_{c}^{\ast-}$. Another type of processes are generated by annihilations $\overline{b}b \to \overline{q}q$ of constituent $b$-quarks which produces the final-state charmed meson pairs $D^{+}D^{-}$, $D^{0} \overline{D}^{0}$, $D^{*+}D^{*-}$, and $D^{*0}\overline{D}^{*0}$. Partial width all of these decays are found using the three-point sum rule method which is required to calculate strong couplings at corresponding meson-meson-tetraquark vertices. Predictions obtained for the mass $m=(12697 \pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T_{\mathrm{2bc}}]=(142.4 \pm 16.9)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the state $T_{\mathrm{2bc}}$ are compared with alternative results, and are useful for further experimental investigations of fully heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>Power counting of the pion-dilaton effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confining QCD-like theories close to the conformal window have a ``walking'' coupling. This is believed to lead to a light singlet scalar meson in the low-energy spectrum, a dilaton, which is the pseudo Nambu--Goldstone boson for the approximate scale symmetry. Extending chiral perturbation theory to include the dilaton requires a new small parameter to control the dilaton mass and its interactions. In our previous work we derived a systematic power counting for the dilaton couplings by matching the effective low-energy theory to the underlying theory using mild assumptions. In this paper we examine two alternative power countings which were proposed in the literature based on a phenomenological picture for the conformal transition. We find that one of these power countings fails, in fact, to generate a systematic expansion; the other coincides with the power counting we derived. We also point out that the so-called $\Delta$-potential coincides with the tree-level potential of the former, invalid, power counting.</description>

      <title>Concurrent VQE for Simulating Excited States of the Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the application of the concurrent variational quantum eigensolver (cVQE) for computing excited states of the Schwinger model. By designing suitable ansatz circuits utilizing universal SO(4) or SO(8) qubit gates, we demonstrate how to efficiently obtain the lowest two, four, and eight eigenstates with one, two, and three ancillary qubits for both vanishing and non-vanishing background electric field cases. Simulating the resulting quantum circuits classically with tensor network techniques, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to compute the two lowest eigenstates of systems with up to $\mathcal{O}(100)$ qubits. Given that our method allows for measuring the low-lying spectrum precisely, we also present a novel technique for estimating the additive mass renormalization of the lattice based on the energy gap. As a proof-of-principle calculation, we prepare the ground and first-excited states with one ancillary and four physical qubits on quantum hardware, demonstrating the practicality of using the cVQE to simulate excited states.</description>

      <title>Hybrid analysis of radiative corrections to neutron decay with current algebra and effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a useful framework for high-precision studies of the neutron beta decay by merging the current algebra description and the fixed-order effective field theory calculation of the electroweak radiative corrections to the neutron axial form factor. We discuss the advantages of this hybrid method and show that it only requires a minimal amount of lattice QCD inputs to achieve a $10^{-4}$ theory accuracy for the Standard Model prediction of the neutron lifetime and the axial-to-vector coupling ratio $\lambda$, both important to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Meson mass and width: Deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is fascinating to predict the mass and width of the ordinary and exotic mesons solely based on their quark content and quantum numbers. Such prediction goes beyond conventional methodologies traditionally employed in hadron physics for calculating or estimating these quantities. The relation between the quantum numbers and the properties of the mesons, such as the mass and width, is complicated in the world of particle physics. However, the deep neural network (DNN) as a subfield of machine learning techniques provides a solution to this problem. By analyzing large datasets, deep learning algorithms can automatically identify complex patterns among the particles' quantum numbers, and their mass and width, that would otherwise require complex calculations. In this study, we present two approaches using the DNNs to estimate the mass of some ordinary and exotic mesons. Also for the first time, the DNNs are trained to predict the width of ordinary and exotic mesons, whose widths have not been experimentally known. Our predictions obtained through the DNNs, will be useful for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Parameters of the tensor tetraquark $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass and width of the tensor tetraquark $T=bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ with spin-parity $J^{\mathrm{P}}=2^{+}$ are calculated in the context of the QCD sum rule method. The tetraquark $T$ is modeled as a diquark-antidiquark state built of components $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }b$ and $\overline{c}\gamma _{\nu }C\overline{c}^{T}$ with $C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m=(12.795\pm 0.095)~\mathrm{GeV}$ of the exotic tensor meson $T$ is found by means of the two-point sum rule approach. Its full width $\Gamma$ is evaluated by considering processes $T \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}$, $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{\ast -}$. Partial widths of these decays are computed by means of the three-point sum rule approach which is used to determine the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Predictions obtained for the width $\Gamma _{\mathrm{T}}=55.5_{-9.9}^{+10.6}~\mathrm{MeV}$, as well as the mass of the tetraquark $T $ can be useful in investigations of fully heavy four-quark mesons.</description>
