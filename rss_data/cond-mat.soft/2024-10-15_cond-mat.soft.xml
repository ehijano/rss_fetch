      <title>Fracture Characterization of Bioinspired Irregular Network Reinforced Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical behavior of composite materials is significantly influenced by their structure and constituent materials. One emerging class of composite materials is irregular network reinforced composites (NRC's), whose reinforcing phase is generated by a stochastic algorithm. Although design of the reinforcing phase network offers tailorable control over both the global mechanical properties, like stiffness and strength, and the local properties, like fracture nucleation and propagation, the fracture properties of irregular NRC's has not yet been fully characterized. This is because both the irregular reinforcing structure and choice of matrix phase material significantly affect the fracture response, often resulting in diffuse damage, associated with multiple crack nucleation locations. Here, we propose irregular polymer NRC's whose matrix phase has a similar stiffness but half the strength of the reinforcing phase, which allows the structure of the reinforcing phase to control the fracture response, while still forming and maintaining a primary crack. Across a range of network coordination numbers, we obtain J-integral and R-curve measurements, and we determine that low coordination polymer NRC's primarily dissipate fracture energy through plastic zone formation, while high coordination polymer NRC's primarily dissipate energy through crack extension. Finally, we determine that there are two critical length scales to characterize and tailor the fracture response of the composites across the coordination numbers: (i) the size of the plastic zone, and (ii) the size and geometry of the structural features, defined as the areas enclosed by the reinforcing network.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the multiscale surface mechanics of soft solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The softer a material is, the more its mechanics are sensitive to interfaces. In soft gels, an elastic polymeric network is filled with free-flowing molecules. In theory, either of these components could dominate the material interfacial properties. In practice, current measurements cannot distinguish between the two, nor can they rule out material inhomogeneities, which could modulate the apparent properties of the interfaces. Here, we introduce an experimental approach that elucidates the interfacial mechanics of soft solids. Coupling quantum dots, controlled deformations, and precise confocal measurements, we fully separate the material inhomogeneities of a silicone gel from its true interfacial properties. We quantify a gradient in bulk elastic properties near the surface, with a characteristic length scale of about 20 {\mu}m. In addition, we observe a surface excess elasticity, whose associated gradient is unresolvable with light microscopy. The composition of the external medium has a strong affect on the observed value of the surface elasticity. Thus, we conclude that the surface elasticity of this silicone network is an interfacial property.</description>

      <title>Role of Wettability, Adhesion, and Instabilities in Transitions During Lubricated Sliding Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lubricated contacts in soft materials are important in various engineering systems and natural settings. Three major lubrication regimes are boundary (BL), mixed (ML), and elasto-hydrodynamic (EHL) lubrication, where the contact region is dry, partially wetted, or fully wetted, respectively. The transition between these regimes is insufficiently understood, especially for soft contacts, which impedes desired control of lubricated sliding friction. Here, we report on the role of solid wettability and adhesion on these transitions. Wettability of glycerol on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface, and adhesion between a glass indenter and PDMS, were varied by exposure of the PDMS to an ultraviolet light-ozone (UV-Ozone) cleaner. By combining friction tests and visualization, we demonstrate that the transition from ML to BL regime is dominated by the wettability of the lubricant; increasing wettability of glycerol makes removal of liquid from the contact region more difficult. Transition from EHL to ML is related to a series of events with increasing normal load, which are thinning of the lubricant layer, sudden jump to contact between the glass indenter and solid substrate across a gap of tens to a few hundreds of nanometers, and attendant elastic instabilities such as wrinkling and stick-slip. These results provide a deeper understanding of transitions in lubricated frictional behavior of soft materials which govern the maximum and minimum friction achievable.</description>

      <title>Measurable geometric indicators of local plasticity in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of defects in crystalline phases of matter has been extremely powerful for understanding crystal growth, deformation and melting. These discontinuities in the periodic order of crystals are mathematically described by the Burgers vector, derived from the particle displacements, which encapsulates the direction and magnitude of slip relative to the undeformed state. Since the reference structure of the crystal is known a priori, the Burgers vector can be determined experimentally using both imaging and diffraction methods to measure the lattice distortion, and thus infer the particle displacements. Glasses have structures that lack the periodicity of crystals, and thus a well-defined reference state. Yet, measurable structural parameters can still be obtained from diffraction from a glass. Here we examine the usefulness of these parameters to probe deformation in glasses. We find that coordinated transformations in the centrosymmetry of local particle arrangements are a strong marker of plastic events. Moreover, we investigate two geometric indicators that can be derived from distortions in local diffraction patterns, namely the continuous Burgers vector and the quadrupolar strain. We find that the Burgers vector again emerges as a robust and sensitive metric for understanding local structural transformations due to mechanical deformation, even in structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Discrete state model of a self-aggregating colloidal system with directional interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of coarse-grained descriptions of a system's kinetics is well established in biophysics. One prominent example is Markov state models in protein folding dynamics. In this paper, we develop a coarse-grained, discrete state model of a self-aggregating colloidal particle system inspired by the concepts of Markov state modelling. The specific self-aggregating system studied here involves field-responsive colloidal particles in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. Starting from particle-resolved (Brownian dynamics) simulations, we define the discrete states by categorizing each particle according to it's local structure. We then describe the kinetics between these states as a series of stochastic, memoryless jumps. In contrast to other works on colloidal self-assembly, our coarse-grained approach describes the simultaneous formation and evolution of multiple aggregates from single particles. Our discrete model also takes into account the changes in transition dynamics between the discrete states as the size of the largest cluster grows. We validate the coarse-grained model by comparing the predicted population fraction in each of the discrete states with those calculated directly from the particle-resolved simulations as a function of the largest cluster size. We then predict population fractions in presence of noise-averaging and in a situation where a model parameter is changed instantaneously after a certain time. Finally, we explore the validity of the detailed balance condition in the various stages of aggregation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular locomotion often involves the motion of thin, elastic filaments, such as cilia and flagella, in viscous environments. The manuscript serves as a general introduction to the topic of modelling microscale elastohydrodynamics. We briefly characterise the specific features of biological filaments that affect their propulsion modes, and discuss the theoretical framework for their description, along with selected biological and artificial examples of active systems.</description>

      <title>Electrophoretic velocity of ion-releasing colloidal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of a matched asymptotic expansions approach the electrophoretic velocity and zeta potential of a catalytic particle that uniformly releases ions have been investigated. Attention is focused on large, compared to diffuse layer, particles characterized, beside the surface potential $\Phi_s$, by the Damk\"{o}hler number Da that represents the ratio of the surface reaction rate to the diffusive transfer one. For vanishing Da, we recover the classical Smoluchowski formula for the electrophoretic velocity which states that the zeta potential of the particle is equal to $\Phi_s$ and that the migration direction is determined by its sign. For small values of Da we show that the migration velocity is controlled mostly by $\Phi_s$ and affected by an ion release only slightly. However, even small Da can induce the electrophoresis of electro-neutral particles that would be immobile if inert. For larger Da the direction of migration and the sign of zeta potential become independent on $\Phi_s$ and are solely determined by the difference in diffusivity of released cations and anions. Still, the surface potential affects the magnitude of the particle velocity.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Morphological Evolution of Neuronal Dendrites by First-Passage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high degree of structural complexity arises in dynamic neuronal dendrites due to extensive branching patterns and diverse spine morphologies, which enable the nervous system to adjust function, construct complex input pathways and thereby enhance the computational power of the system. Owing to the determinant role of dendrite morphology in the functionality of the nervous system, recognition of pathological changes due to neurodegenerative disorders is of crucial importance. We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary signal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex dendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology. As a feasible scenario, we propose engineering mRNA-carrying multilamellar liposomes to diffusively reach the soma and release mRNAs, which encodes a specific protein upon encountering ribosomes. The concentration of this protein over a large population of neurons can be externally measured, as a detectable temporary signal. By developing a stochastic coarse-grained approach for first-passage through dendrites, we connect the model parameters to the characteristics of the evolving signal and, on the other hand, map them to the key morphological properties affected by neurodegenerative diseases -- including the density and size of spines, the extent of the tree, and the segmental increase of dendrite diameter towards soma. Thus, we establish a direct link between the dendrite morphology and the statistical characteristics of the detectable signal. Our approach provides a fast noninvasive measurement technique to indirectly extract vital information about the morphological evolution of dendrites in the course of neurodegenerative disease progression.</description>

      <title>Drag and torque coefficients of a translating particle with slip at a gas-liquid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of colloid-size particles trapped at a liquid interface is an extensively studied problem owing to its relevance to a wide range of engineering applications. Here we investigate the impact of interfacial deformations on the hydrodynamic force and torque exerted on a spherical particle with surface slip moving along a gas-liquid interface. Following a two-parameter asymptotic modeling approach, we perturb the interface from its planar state and apply the Lorentz reciprocal theorem to the zeroth and first-order approximations to analytically calculate the drag and torque on the particle. This allows us to explicitly account for the effect of physical parameters like the three-phase contact angle, the Bond number, and the slip coefficient on the particle motion. In addition, we study the interactions between two translating and rotating particles at a large separation. The interaction forces and torques exerted by the flow-induced deformations are calculated via the linear superposition approximation, where the interaction forces are identified as dipolar in terms of the azimuthal angle.</description>

      <title>Effective osmotic pressure of foams in short-term dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foams exhibit absorptive properties and are widely used for cleaning contaminants, oil recovery, and selective mineral extraction via froth flotation. Although foam absorption has historically been linked to equilibrium osmotic pressure, empirical observations show that drainage occurs at levels much lower than theoretical predictions. In this study, we investigate the effective osmotic pressure in foams. The experimental findings indicate that effective osmotic pressure is primarily influenced by short-term dynamics and is governed by the yield stress rather than equilibrium osmotic pressure. Gravity-induced flow drives bubble movement downward, subjecting the lower bubbles to increased pressure. Once the pressure exerted by the solution exceeds the yield stress, internal bubble rearrangement occurs, and drainage is promoted by the relaxation of inter-bubble repulsive forces. In contrast, below the yield stress, these repulsive forces suppress drainage. While foams have traditionally been modeled as immobile porous media, the reality involves kinematic coupling between the solution and the bubbles, which establishes yield stress as the key factor in determining effective osmotic pressure. This framework is also relevant to the dynamics of soft jammed systems, such as blood flow in vessels, emulsions, and biological tissues, offering significant advancements in the understanding of soft jammed system behavior.</description>

      <title>Why hyperdensity functionals describe any equilibrium observable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recent hyperdensity functional theory for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of soft matter systems [F. Samm\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024); 10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.098201]. Hyperdensity functionals give access to the behaviour of arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium many-body systems. The approach is based on classical density functional theory applied to an extended ensemble using standard functional techniques. The associated formally exact generalized Mermin-Evans functional relationships can be represented efficiently by neural functionals. These neural networks are trained via simulation-based supervised machine learning and they allow one to carry out efficient functional calculus using automatic differentiation and numerical functional line integration. Exact sum rules, including hard wall contact theorems and hyperfluctuation Ornstein-Zernike equations, interrelate the different correlation functions. We lay out close connections to hyperforce correlation sum rules [S. Robitschko et al., Commun. Phys. 7, 103 (2024); 10.1038/s42005-024-01568-y] that arise from statistical mechanical gauge invariance [J. M\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. (to appear); arXiv:2406.19235]. Further quantitative measures of collective self-organization are provided by hyperdirect correlation functionals and spatially resolved hyperfluctuation profiles. The theory facilitates to gain deep insight into the inherent structuring mechanisms that govern the behaviour of both simple and complex order parameters in coupled many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RMs (reverse micelles) provide a controlled system for studying the unique structural and dynamic behaviors of confined water, thus gaining a general insight into the behavior or water under confinement and at interfaces. This study employs ESR (Electron Spin Resonance) to study the dynamics inside RMs and capitalizes on the fact that different preparations of RMs can precisely manipulate both the size of water pools as well as whether or not different pools can come into contact. A small spin label moiety, less than a half nanometer in size tumbles in solution, offering insight into the rotational diffusion from room temperature down to deeply super-cooled temperatures. Two different spin probes can separately probe the dynamics of the interfacial layer vs. those at the core of the reverse micelle. The results provide critical insights into how thermodynamic transitions affect the stability and behavior of water in confined spaces, enhancing the understanding of nucleation and ice crystal growth, as well as the broader understanding of confined water's role in various chemical and biological systems. The ability to more precisely understand and control reaction dynamics and thermodynamics inside confined aqueous systems across a broad range of temperatures will prove useful to fields ranging from biophysics to the development of new nano-materials.</description>

      <title>Singular Twist Waves in Chromonic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromonic liquid crystals are lyotropic nematic phases whose applications span from food to drug industries. It has recently been suggested that the elastic energy density governing the equilibrium distortions of these materials may be quartic in the measure of twist. Here we show that the non-linear twist-wave equation associated with such an energy has smooth solutions that break down in a finite time, giving rise to the formation of a shock wave, under rather generic assumptions on the initial profile. The critical time at which smooth solutions become singular is estimated analytically with an accuracy that numerical calculations for a number of exemplary cases prove to be satisfactory.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Effects on the Hydrodynamics of an Active Compound Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.</description>

      <title>Tethered Particle Motion Technique in Crowded Media: Compaction of DNA by Globular Macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tethered Particle Motion (TPM) is a single molecule technique, which consists in tracking the motion of a nano-particle (NP) immersed in a fluid and tethered to a glass surface by a DNA molecule. The present work addresses the question of the applicability of TPM to fluids which contain crowders at volume fractions ranging from that of the nucleoid of living bacteria (around 30%) up to the jamming threshold (around 66%). In particular, we were interested in determining whether TPM can be used to characterize the compaction of DNA by globular crowders. To this end, extensive Brownian Dynamics simulations were performed with a specifically built coarse-grained model. Analysis of the simulations reveals several effects not observed in dilute media, which impose constraints on the TPM set-up. In particular, the Tethered Fluorophore Motion (TFM) technique, which consists in replacing the NP by a much smaller fluorophore, is probably better suited than standard TPM. Moreover, a sample preparation technique which does not involve hydrophilic patches may be required. Finally, the use of a DNA brush may be needed to achieve DNA concentrations close to in vivo ones.</description>

      <title>Shear-Driven Diffusion with Stochastic Resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External flows, such as shear flow, add directional biases to particle motion, introducing anisotropic behavior into the system. Here, we explore the non-equilibrium dynamics that emerge from the interplay between linear shear flow and stochastic resetting. The particle diffuses with a constant diffusion coefficient while simultaneously experiencing linear shear and being stochastically returned to its initial position at a constant rate. We perturbatively derive the steady-state probability distribution that captures the effects of shear-induced anisotropy on the spatial structure of the distribution. We show that the dynamics perform a crossover from a diffusive to a super-diffusive regime, which cease to exist in the absence of shear flow. We also show that the skewness has a non-monotonic behavior when one passes from the shear-dominated to the resetting-dominated regime. We demonstrate that at small resetting rates, while resetting events are rare, they incur a large energetic cost to sustain the non-equilibrium steady state. Surprisingly, if only the $x$-position is reset, the system never reaches a steady state but instead spreads diffusively.</description>

      <title>Elastocapillary sequential fluid capture in hummingbird-inspired grooved sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive and effective fluid capture and transport at small scale is crucial for industrial and medical applications, especially for the realisation of point-of-care tests. Performing these tests involves several steps including biological fluid capture, aliquoting, reaction with reagents at the fluid-device interface, and reading of the results. Ideally, these tests must be fast and offer a large surface-to-volume ratio to achieve rapid and precise diagnostics with a reduced amount of fluid. Such constraints are often contradictory as a high surface-to-volume ratio implies a high hydraulic resistance and hence a decrease in the flow rate. Inspired by the feeding mechanism of hummingbirds, we propose a frugal fluid capture device that takes advantage of elastocapillary deformations to enable concomitant fast liquid transport, aliquoting, and high confinement in the deformed state. The hierarchical design of the device - that consists in vertical grooves stacked on an elastic sheet - enables a two-step sequential fluid capture. Each unit groove mimics the hummingbird's tongue and closes due to capillary forces when a wetting liquid penetrates, yielding the closure of the whole device in a tubular shape, where additional liquid is captured. Combining elasticity, capillarity, and viscous flow, we rationalise the fluid-structure interaction at play both when liquid is scarce - end dipping and capillary rise - and abundant - full dipping. By functionalising the surface of the grooves such a passive device can concomitantly achieve all the steps of point-of-care tests, opening the way for the design of optimal devices for fluid capture and transport in microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Energies for elastic plates and shells from quadratic-stretch elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive stretching and bending energies for isotropic elastic plates and shells. Through the dimensional reduction of a bulk elastic energy quadratic in Biot strains, we obtain two-dimensional bending energies quadratic in bending measures featuring a bilinear coupling of stretches and geometric curvatures. For plates, the bending measure is invariant under spatial dilations and naturally extends primitive bending strains for straight rods. For shells or naturally-curved rods, the measure is not dilation invariant, and contrasts with previous \emph{ad hoc} postulated forms. The corresponding field equations and boundary conditions feature moments linear in the bending measures, and a decoupling of stretching and bending such that application of a pure moment results in isometric deformation of a unique neutral surface, primitive behaviors in agreement with classical linear response but not displayed by commonly used analytical models. We briefly comment on relations between our energies, those derived from a neo-Hookean bulk energy, and a commonly used discrete model for flat membranes. Although the derivation requires consideration of stretch and rotation fields, the resulting energy and field equations can be expressed entirely in terms of metric and curvature components of deformed and reference surfaces.</description>

      <title>ATP-induced reconfiguration of the micro-viscoelasticity of cardiac and skeletal myosin solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the high-frequency micro-mechanical response of suspensions composed by cardiac and skeletal muscle myosin by optical trapping interferometry. We observe that in low ionic strength solutions upon the addition of magnesium adenosine triphosphate (\ch{MgATP^2-}), myosin suspensions radically change their micro-mechanics properties, generating a viscoelastic fluid characterized by a complex modulus similar to a suspension of worm-like micelles. This transduction of energy, from chemical to mechanical, may be related to the relaxed states of myosin, which regulate muscle contractility and can be involved in the etiology of many myopathies. Within an analogous generic mechanical response, cardiac and skeletal myosin suspensions provide different stress relaxation times, elastic modulus values, and characteristic lengths. These discrepancies probably rely on the dissimilar physiological functions of cardiac and skeletal muscle, on the different MgATPase hydrolysis rates of cardiac and skeletal myosins, and on the observed distinct cooperative behavior of their myosin heads in the super-relaxed state. \textit{In vitro} studies like these allow to understand the foundations of muscle cells mechanics on the micro-scale, and may contribute to the engineering of biological materials whose micro-mechanics can be activated by energy regulators.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Dynamics of a Liquid in the Vicinity of an Attractive Surface: The Process of Escaping from the Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the displacements of the particles of a glass-forming molecular liquid perpendicular to a confining solid surface, using extensive molecular dynamics simulations with atomistic models. In the vicinity of an attractive surface, the liquid molecules are trapped. Transient localization of liquid molecules near the surface introduces a relaxation process, related to the escape of molecules from the surface, into the dynamics of the interfacial liquid layer. To describe this process, we analyze several dynamical observables of the confined liquid. The self-intermediate scattering function and the mean-squared displacement of the particles located in the interfacial layer are dominated by the process of escaping from the surface. This relaxation process is also associated with a strong heterogeneity in the mobility of the interfacial particles. The studied model liquid is hydrogenated methyl methacrylate. For the confining wall, we consider different models, namely a periodic single layer of graphene and a frozen amorphous configuration of the bulk liquid (frozen wall). Near graphene, where the liquid molecules form a layered structure and adopt parallel-to-surface orientation, a clear separation between small-scale movements of the molecules near the surface and the process of escaping from the surface is observed. This is reflected in the three-step relaxation of the interfacial layer. However, near the frozen wall, where the liquid molecules do not have a preferential alignment, a clear three-step relaxation is not seen, even though the dynamical quantities are controlled by the process of escaping from the surface.</description>

      <title>Active fractal networks with stochastic force monopoles and force dipoles: Application to subdiffusion of chromosomal loci</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the well-known fractal packing of chromatin, we study the Rouse-type dynamics of elastic fractal networks with embedded, stochastically driven, active force monopoles and force dipoles that are temporally correlated. We compute, analytically -- using a general theoretical framework -- and {\it via} Langevin dynamics simulations, the mean square displacement (MSD) of a network bead. Following a short-time superdiffusive behavior, force monopoles yield anomalous subdiffusion with an exponent identical to that of the thermal system. In contrast, force dipoles do not induce subdiffusion, and the early superdiffusive MSD crosses over to a relatively small, system-size-independent saturation value. In addition, we find that force dipoles may lead to "crawling" rotational motion of the whole network, reminiscent of that found for triangular micro-swimmers and consistent with general theories of the rotation of deformable bodies. Moreover, force dipoles lead to network collapse beyond a critical force strength, which persists with increasing system size, signifying a true first-order dynamical phase transition. We apply our results to the motion of chromosomal loci in bacteria and yeast cells' chromatin, where anomalous sub-diffusion, MSD$\sim t^{\nu}$ with $\nu\simeq 0.4$, was found in both normal and ATP-depleted cells, albeit with different apparent diffusion coefficients. We show that the combination of thermal, monopolar, and dipolar forces in chromatin is typically dominated by the active monopolar and thermal forces, explaining the observed normal cells vs the ATP-depleted cells behavior.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective optimization for targeted self-assembly among competing polymorphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most approaches for designing self-assembled materials focus on the thermodynamic stability of a target structure or crystal polymorph. Yet in practice, the outcome of a self-assembly process is often controlled by kinetic pathways. Here we present an efficient machine learning-guided design algorithm to identify globally optimal interaction potentials that maximize both the thermodynamic yield and kinetic accessibility of a target polymorph. We show that optimal potentials exist along a Pareto front, indicating the possibility of a trade-off between the thermodynamic and kinetic objectives. Although the extent of this trade-off depends on the target polymorph and the assembly conditions, we generically find that the trade-off arises from a competition among alternative polymorphs: The most kinetically optimal potentials, which favor the target polymorph on short timescales, tend to stabilize a competing polymorph at longer times. Our work establishes a general-purpose approach for multi-objective self-assembly optimization, reveals fundamental trade-offs between crystallization speed and defect formation in the presence of competing polymorphs, and suggests guiding principles for materials design algorithms that optimize for kinetic accessibility.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of Transport through Evolving Spatial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insight into the blockage vulnerability of evolving spatial networks is important for understanding transport resilience, robustness, and failure of a broad class of real-world structures such as porous media and utility, urban traffic, and infrastructure networks. By exhaustive search for central transport hubs on porous lattice structures, we recursively determine and block the emerging main hub until the evolving network reaches the impenetrability limit. We find that the blockage backbone is a self-similar path with a fractal dimension which is distinctly smaller than that of the universality class of optimal path crack models. The number of blocking steps versus the rescaled initial occupation fraction collapses onto a master curve for different network sizes, allowing for the prediction of the onset of impenetrability. The shortest-path length distribution broadens during the blocking process reflecting an increase of spatial correlations. We address the reliability of our predictions upon increasing the disorder or decreasing the fraction of processed structural information.</description>

Abstract: The effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of particles -- arising from the conservation of momentum in the fluid medium -- is examined in the context of the relationship between fluctuations, response functions, and the entropy production rate. The multiplicative nature of the hydrodynamic interactions is shown to introduce subtleties that preclude a straightforward extension of the Harada-Sasa relation. A generalization of the definitions involved in the framework is used to propose a new form of the relation applicable to systems with hydrodynamic interactions. The resulting framework will enable characterization of the non-equilibrium properties of living and active matter systems, which are predominantly in suspensions.</description>

      <title>The positioning of stress fibers in contractile cells minimizes internal mechanical stress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanics of animal cells is strongly determined by stress fibers, which are contractile filament bundles that form dynamically in response to extracellular cues. Stress fibers allow the cell to adapt its mechanics to environmental conditions and to protect it from structural damage. While the physical description of single stress fibers is well-developed, much less is known about their spatial distribution on the level of whole cells. Here, we combine a finite element method for one-dimensional fibers embedded in an elastic bulk medium with dynamical rules for stress fiber formation based on genetic algorithms. We postulate that their main goal is to achieve minimal mechanical stress in the bulk material with as few fibers as possible. The fiber positions and configurations resulting from this optimization task alone are in good agreement with those found in experiments where cells in 3D-scaffolds were mechanically strained at one attachment point. For optimized configurations, we find that stress fibers typically run through the cell in a diagonal fashion, similar to reinforcement strategies used for composite material.</description>

      <title>Simplifying FFT-based methods for solid mechanics with automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) methods have been widely used in solid mechanics to address complex homogenization problems. However, current FFT-based methods face challenges that limit their applicability to intricate material models or complex mechanical problems. These challenges include the manual implementation of constitutive laws and the use of computationally expensive and complex algorithms to couple microscale mechanisms to macroscale material behavior. Here, we incorporate automatic differentiation (AD) within the FFT framework to mitigate these challenges. We demonstrate that AD-enhanced FFT-based methods can derive stress and tangent stiffness directly from energy density functionals, facilitating the extension of FFT-based methods to more intricate material models. Additionally, automatic differentiation simplifies the calculation of homogenized tangent stiffness for microstructures with complex architectures and constitutive properties. This enhancement renders current FFT-based methods more modular, enabling them to tackle homogenization in complex multiscale systems, especially those involving multiphysics processes. Furthermore, we illustrate the use of the AD-enhanced FFT method for problems that extend beyond homogenization, such as uncertainty quantification and topology optimization where automatic differentiation simplifies the computation of sensitivities. Our work will simplify the numerical implementation of FFT-based methods for complex solid mechanics problems.</description>
