      <title>Exploring the Efficacy of Convolutional Neural Networks in Sleep Apnea Detection from Single Channel EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep apnea, a prevalent sleep disorder, involves repeated episodes of breathing interruptions during sleep, leading to various health complications, including cognitive impairments, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and even death. One of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating sleep apnea is identifying individuals at risk. The current gold standard for diagnosis, Polysomnography (PSG), is costly, labor intensive, and inconvenient, often resulting in poor quality sleep data. This paper presents a novel approach to the detection of sleep apnea using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on single channel EEG data. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy of 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, demonstrating a significant potential for home based applications by addressing the limitations of PSG in automated sleep apnea detection. Key contributions of this work also include the development of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth filter, a dataset construction method providing broader temporal context, and the application of SMOTETomek to address class imbalance. This research underscores the feasibility of transitioning from traditional laboratory based diagnostics to more accessible, automated home based solutions, improving patient outcomes and broadening the accessibility of sleep disorder diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks Based Inertial Signal Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an approach in which inertial signals measured with a wrist-worn sensor (e.g., a smartwatch) are translated into those that would be recorded using a shoe-mounted sensor, enabling the use of state-of-the-art gait analysis methods. In the study, the signals are translated using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Two different GAN versions are used for experimental verification: traditional ones trained using binary cross-entropy loss and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs). For the generator, two architectures, a convolutional autoencoder, and a convolutional U-Net, are tested. The experiment results have shown that the proposed approach allows for an accurate translation, enabling the use of wrist sensor inertial signals for efficient, every-day gait analysis.</description>

      <title>A Fluid Antenna Enabled Physical Layer Key Generation for Next-G Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge. Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA), the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Review of Sensor Insoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plantar pressure measurement, or pedobarography, is an essential tool for analyzing human motion in healthy individuals and patients. Across the reviewed literature, sensor insoles are motivated as wearable, mobile solutions for assessing pressure distribution in applications including diabetic foot monitoring, rehabilitation guidance, assistive device control, and sports performance analysis. This review evaluates the current state of the art with particular attention to sensor technologies, sensor quantity and placement, participant cohorts, and reference standards. The focus lies on original works with innovative designs, preferably supported by ambulation experiments. The modalities covered include resistive, capacitive, inductive, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and optical sensing approaches. We identify a lack of proper sensor calibration, gait-based verification, and human study validation, and propose a gold standard based on testing machines and instrumented treadmills to ensure comparability across studies. The bidirectional interaction between insole insertion and foot-sole mechanics is examined, with tissue stiffness identified as a key source of uncertainty in sensor signals. Guidelines are provided for sensor dimensions and unobtrusive insole designs to foster natural gait. Finally, future directions include the development of multimodal sensors to compensate for limitations of individual modalities and the emerging trend of multiaxial sensing for capturing shear components in pressure distributions.</description>

      <title>CoMET: A Contrastive-Masked Brain Foundation Model for Universal EEG Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain activity, widely used in brain-computer interfaces, clinic, and healthcare. Traditional EEG deep models typically focus on specific dataset and task, limiting model size and generalization. Recently, self-supervised brain foundation models have emerged and been applied to various downstream tasks. Nevertheless, these models still have limitations: current SOTA models typically rely on masked reconstruction strategy; however, EEG features of adjacent channels are highly correlated, which causes the pre-training to overly focus on low-dimensional signal-similarity features in local regions and neglect the global discriminative patterns vital for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a brain foundation model called CoMET. Specifically, we employ the masked autoencoder with redesigned patching and embedding for EEG as backbone and devise a novel contrastive learning framework with mirror-scale augmentation to strengthen the global discrimination ability. CoMET is pre-trained on mixed EEG datasets over 3000 subjects with over one million samples. It is evaluated on ten different downstream datasets, and the SOTA results demonstrate CoMET's superior ability in extracting universal EEG representations and strong clinical potential.</description>

      <title>Gait Analysis using 6DoF Magnetic Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gait analysis using wearable devices has advantages over non-wearable devices when it comes to portability and accessibility. However, non-wearable devices have consistently shown superior performance in terms of the gait information they can provide. This calls for the need to improve the performance of wearable device based gait analysis. To that end, we developed a 6 Degrees-of-Freedom (6DoF) magnetic tracking based gait analysis system as a step in this direction. The system is portable, minimally intrusive, wireless and power efficient. As a proof-of-concept, the system was used for the task of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to classify four tasks - walking (W), walking with weight (WW), jogging (J) and marching on the spot (M). Gait data of 12 participants was collected. The classification performance of two deep learning (DL) classifiers - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) - was compared. The performance of the magnetic tracking based gait analysis system was also compared with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) + magnetometer based system. The magnetic tracking based system showed an overall classification accuracy of 92\% compared to 86.69\% for the IMU + magnetometer system. Moreover, the magnetic tracking system showed an improvement of about 8\% in being able to differentiate between W and WW. This highlights the insufficiency in the information content in the data from IMU + magnetometer, warranting the need for a complete 6DoF tracking. Our work, thus, proves the feasibility of using magnetic tracking systems for the purpose of gait analysis.</description>

      <title>AN-Aided Secure Beamforming for ELAA-SWIPT in Mixed Near- and Far-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates secure hybrid beamforming (HB) design for an extremely large-scale antenna array-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system operating in a mixed near-field (NF)/far-field (FF) environment. A base station (BS) employs HB to transmit information and artificial noise (AN) signals simultaneously to multiple FF information receivers (IRs) and NF energy receivers (ERs). The objective is to maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate for the IRs, considering both Type-I (unable to cancel AN) and Type-II (capable of canceling AN) IRs, subject to minimum energy harvesting requirements at the ERs and a BS transmit power constraint. We formulate optimization problems for both IR types and develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation. Simulation results validate the proposed scheme and provide crucial insights into the security performance of mixed-field SWIPT systems, highlighting the influence of visibility regions and angular user separation.</description>

      <title>Pilot Allocation and Receiver Design for Cell-Free Massive MIMO ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges in cell-freemassive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) systems:efficient pilot allocation and practical receiver design. To thisend, we introduce a novel pilot allocation framework leveragingmanifold optimization to maximize the system sum rate, wherepilot sequences are designed as nearly orthogonal sequences. Theproposed pilot design enforces unimodularity constraints in thefrequency domain, ensuring pilots are suitable for both communi-cation and sensing tasks. Additionally, a gaussian belief propaga-tion (GaBP)-based receiver is introduced, providing near-optimaldetection performance with substantially reduced computationalcomplexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposedpilot allocation method achieves communication performancecomparable to state-of-the-art (SotA) algorithms, while deliveringsuperior sensing capabilities due to its unimodular pilot design.The GaBP-based receiver achieves robust performance andlower complexity compared to conventional approaches. Thesecontributions advance the practical deployment of CF-mMIMOfor integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).</description>

      <title>Distributed Deployment and Dual-Frequency Concepts to Strengthen Sub-THz Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast bandwidth available at sub-THz frequencies holds great promise for high-speed wireless access, precise localization, and advanced sensing applications. However, fundamental physical constraints and technological limitations make the deployment of reliable sub-THz networks challenging. We propose a new paradigm for sub-THz coverage by transmitting the RF signals over polymer microwave fibers (PMFs) that interconnect low-complexity radio units (RUs) in a daisy-chain configuration. The distributed architecture ensures that user equipments (UEs) connect to RUs in their proximity, reducing path loss and mitigating blocking. The RUs leverage low-complexity, compact integrated antenna modules. Additionally, dual-frequency tandem operation is proposed, integrating the sub-THz system with a sub-10 GHz system that provides control signalling and a robust fallback solution for the sub-THz system. This proposed tandem architecture can open up the full potential of sub-THz technology and paves the way to cost- and energy-efficient, high-performance, real-time connectivity in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Robust Resource Allocation for LEO Satellite-Assisted Secure SWIPT via STAR-RIS under CSI Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust resource allocation framework for a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite-enabled simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system, assisted by a ground-deployed simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). We consider a scenario where direct satellite-to-ground links are obstructed, and the satellite serves multiple single-antenna energy receivers, information receivers, and eavesdroppers exclusively via the STAR-RIS. A robust optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total harvested power, subject to secrecy rate requirements, transmit power limits, and STAR-RIS coefficient constraints, under a practical bounded channel state information (CSI) error model. To achieve optimal robust resource allocation, we address the challenges posed by coupled optimization variables and bounded channel estimation errors by first applying the S-procedure to handle robustness against channel uncertainty. An alternating optimization (AO) framework is subsequently proposed, where the active beamforming at the LEO satellite and the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS are jointly optimized, and a penalty-based strategy is incorporated to enforce the STAR-RIS beamforming design. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that the STAR-RIS architecture achieves substantial performance gains in total harvested power over conventional RIS and other baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>PyNoetic: A modular python framework for no-code development of EEG brain-computer interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics, virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software, and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI development and thus accelerate their research endeavors.

      <title>Uninformed-to-Informed Estimation: A Ping-Pong Positioning Method for Multi-user Wideband mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the positioning and tracking performance of dynamic user equipment (UE) in wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, we propose a novel positioning error lower bound (PELB)-driven ping-pong positioning framework, where the base station (BS) and UE alternately transmit and receive adaptive beamforming signals for positioning. All beam-formers are scheduled based on the locally evaluated PELB. In this framework, we exploit multi-dimensional information fusion to assist in positioning. Firstly, a multi-subcarrier collaborative positioning error lower bound (MSCPEB) is proposed to evaluate the positioning error limits of wideband mmWave systems, which quantifies the contribution of all subcarriers to positioning accuracy. Moreover, we prove that the MSCPEB does not exceed the arithmetic mean of the PELBs of the individual subcarriers. Subsequently, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize the hybrid beamformers targeted for MSCPEB minimization. By convexifying this problem, closed-form solutions of beamformers are derived. Finally, we develop a multipath collaborative positioning method that quantifies the impact of path reliability on positioning accuracy, with a closed-form solution for user position derived. The proposed method does not rely on path resolution and traditional triangular relationships. Numerical results validate that the proposed method improves estimation accuracy by at least 16% compared to potential schemes without optimized beam configurations, while requiring only approximately one-quarter of the slot resources.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Mega-Constellation Links for LEO Missions With Applications to EO and ISS Use Cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite missions demand ever greater connectivity, especially in the LEO regime. In this paper, we introduce the new mega-constellation services in space paradigm: we show that megaconstellations, deployed to offer innovative services to Earth's users, can provide excellent connectivity to LEO spacecraft as well. First, we characterise the communication link between space users and the actual OneWeb and Starlink constellations. A full set of results in terms of availability, access duration, Doppler, and path losses as a function of user orbital parameters, identifying optimal user orbits, is provided. The results achieved by a multi-system user able to communicate with both fleets are also presented. The potential improvements available if geostationary constellations are used to complement LEO megaconstellations in a multi-orbit system are discussed as well. Finally, we focus on two LEO use cases: the International Space Station and an Earth Observation Sun Synchronous satellite. All the results demonstrate the numerous advantages of the mega-constellation connectivity solution, which can transform LEO spacecraft into highly responsive nodes of a space-to-space network.</description>

      <title>Fast Regularized 3D Near-Field MIMO Imaging Using Stochastic Proximal Gradient Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar imaging suffers from high computational load inherently due to irregular spatial sampling with distributed antennas. Existing acceleration methods for near-field MIMO imaging typically rely on interpolation or compensation of measurements and are primarily developed for direct reconstruction. This hinders their ease of adoption for different MIMO geometries and requires further modification for regularized inversion. In this study, we address these challenges by developing a fast regularized reconstruction approach for three-dimensional near-field MIMO imaging based on the Stochastic Proximal Gradient Method. We demonstrate the performance of the developed approach through experimental measurements. The results show a significant improvement in runtime without any notable compromise in reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolding with Approximated Computations for Rapid Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization-based solvers play a central role in a wide range of signal processing and communication tasks. However, their applicability in latency-sensitive systems is limited by the sequential nature of iterative methods and the high computational cost per iteration. While deep unfolding has emerged as a powerful paradigm for converting iterative algorithms into learned models that operate with a fixed number of iterations, it does not inherently address the cost of each iteration. In this paper, we introduce a learned optimization framework that jointly tackles iteration count and per-iteration complexity. Our approach is based on unfolding a fixed number of optimization steps, replacing selected iterations with low-complexity approximated computations, and learning extended hyperparameters from data to compensate for the introduced approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two representative problems: (i) hybrid beamforming; and (ii) robust principal component analysis. These fundamental case studies show that our learned approximated optimizers can achieve state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational complexity by over three orders of magnitude. Our results highlight the potential of our approach to enable rapid, interpretable, and efficient decision-making in real-time systems.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Cognition: Semantic Situation for Next-Generation Spectrum Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the growing complexity and demands of future wireless communication networks, spectrum cognition has emerged as an essential technique for optimizing spectrum utilization in next-generation wireless networks. This article presents a comprehensive overview of spectrum cognition, underscoring its critical role in enhancing the efficiency and security of future wireless systems through the innovative perspective of "data processing to signal analysis to semantic situation". Semantic situation, as the highest level of spectrum cognition, enables the extraction of meaningful information from raw spectrum data to provide intelligent support for network decisions. We formally define spectrum cognition, clearly distinguishing it from traditional spectrum sensing, and delve into the latest advancements in both traditional and intelligent spectrum cognition frameworks, addressing key challenges in spectrum cognition. Furthermore, we propose concrete technical solutions to address these challenges, highlighting the transformative potential of semantic situation in shaping next-generation wireless systems. Our findings not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of spectrum cognition but also offer practical insights for its implementation in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Error-Correction Code Encoders in Superconducting Electronic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3) codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Dispersive Continuous MIMO Systems: Channel Modeling and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the modeling and optimal beamforming (BF) design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems operating over doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. First, a comprehensive DD continuous MIMO (DDC MIMO) channel model that incorporates CAPAs at both the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) is derived, which is used to obtain explicit input-output (I/O) relations for various waveforms well suited to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) and robust to DD channels, namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Then, functional optimization problems are formulated for the design of TX and RX BF matrices that maximize received power, in which novel low-complexity, closed-form solutions are obtained via the calculus of variations (CoV) method, yielding expressions closely related to the classical matched filter commonly used in conventional MIMO systems. Simulation results confirm that the proposed TX/RX BF designs with CAPAs provide significant performance and computational complexity gains over conventional MIMO systems in DD channels.</description>

      <title>Localized Supervised Learning for Cryo-ET Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) is a powerful tool in structural biology for 3D visualization of cells and biological systems at resolutions sufficient to identify individual proteins in situ. The measurements are collected by tilting the frozen specimen and exposing it to an electron beam of known dosage. As the biological samples are prone to electron damage, the samples can be exposed to only a limited dosage of electrons, leading to noisy and incomplete measurements. Thus, the reconstructions are noisy and incomplete, leading to the missing wedge problem. Currently, self-supervised learning is used to compensate for this issue. This typically involves, for each volume to recover, training a large 3D UNet on the initial noisy reconstruction, leading to large training time and memory requirements. In this work, we exploit the local nature of the forward model to train a lightweight network using only localized data from the measurements. This design provides flexibility in balancing computational and time requirements while reconstructing the volumes with high accuracy. We observe experimentally that this network can work well on unseen datasets, despite using a network trained on a few measurements.</description>

      <title>BSNeRF: Broadband Spectral Neural Radiance Fields for Snapshot Multispectral Light-field Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snapshot Multispectral Light-field Imaging (SMLI) is an emerging computational imaging technique that captures high-dimensional data (x, y, z, $\theta$, $\phi$, $\lambda$) in a single shot using a low-dimensional sensor. The accuracy of high-dimensional data reconstruction depends on representing the spectrum using neural radiance field models, which requires consideration of broadband spectral decoupling during optimization. Currently, some SMLI approaches avoid the challenge of model decoupling by either reducing light-throughput or prolonging imaging time. In this work, we propose a broadband spectral neural radiance field (BSNeRF) for SMLI systems. Experiments show that our model successfully decouples a broadband multiplexed spectrum. Consequently, this approach enhances multispectral light-field image reconstruction and further advances plenoptic imaging.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework For Cascaded Channel Estimation in RIS-Aided mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cascaded channel estimation for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave multi-user communication systems. Since the complex channel gains of the cascaded RIS channel are generally non-Gaussian, the use of the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator leads to inevitable performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we propose a variational inference-based framework that approximates the complex channel gains using a complex adaptive Laplace prior, which effectively captures their probability distributions in a tractable way. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms conventional estimators including least squares and LMMSE in terms of cascaded channel estimation error.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Port Prediction based on Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study seeks to utilize large language models (LLMs) to forecast the moving ports of fluid antenna (FA). By repositioning the antenna to the locations identified by our proposed model, we intend to address the mobility challenges faced by user equipment (UE). To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces, for the first time, the application of LLMs in the prediction of FA ports, presenting a novel model termed Port-LLM. The architecture of our model is based on the pre-trained GPT-2 framework. We designed specialized data preprocessing, input embedding, and output projection modules to effectively bridge the disparities between the wireless communication data and the data format utilized by the pre-trained LLM. Simulation results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior predictive performance under different numbers of base station (BS) antennas and varying UE speeds, indicating strong generalization and robustness ability. Furthermore, the spectral efficiency (SE) attained by our model surpasses that achieved by traditional methods in both medium and high-speed mobile environments.</description>

      <title>Enabling 6G Through Multi-Domain Channel Extrapolation: Opportunities and Challenges of Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel extrapolation has attracted wide attention due to its potential to acquire channel state information (CSI) with high accuracy and minimal overhead. This is becoming increasingly crucial as the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks aim to support complex scenarios, for example, high-mobility communications utilizing ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies and broad spectrum bands, necessitating multi-domain channel extrapolation. Current research predominantly addresses channel extrapolation within a single domain, lacking a comprehensive approach to multi-domain channel extrapolation. To bridge the gap, we propose the concept of multi-domain channel extrapolation, detailing the essential performance requirements for 6G networks. These include precise channel extrapolation, adaptability to varying scenarios, and manageable computational complexity during both training and inference stages. In light of these requirements, we elaborate the potential and challenges of incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-based models for effective multi-domain channel extrapolation. Given the ability of the Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and hidden patterns, we propose a novel Transformer encoder-like model by eliminating the positional encoding module and replacing the original multi-head attention with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for multi-domain channel extrapolation. Simulation results indicate that this model surpasses existing baseline models in terms of extrapolation accuracy and inference speed. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the module design of the proposed design. Finally, we pose several open questions for the development of practical GAI-based multi-domain channel extrapolation models, including the issues of explainability, generalization, and dataset collection.</description>

      <title>A Model-Based Dictionary Approach for Magnetic Nanoparticle Signal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tracer-based medical imaging modality that enables quantification and spatial mapping of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) distribution. The magnetization response of MNPs depends on experimental conditions such as drive field (DF) settings and medium viscosity, as well as on magnetic parameters of MNPs such as magnetic core diameter, hydrodynamic diameter, and magnetic anisotropy constant. A comprehensive understanding of the magnetization response of MNPs can facilitate the optimization of DF and MNP type for a given MPI application, without the need for extensive experimentation. In this work, we propose a calibration-free iterative algorithm using model-based dictionaries for MNP signal prediction at untested settings. Dictionaries were constructed with the MNP signals simulated using the coupled Brown-N\'eel rotation model. Based on the available measurements, the proposed algorithm jointly estimates the dictionary weights and the transfer functions due to non-model-based dynamics. These dynamics include the system response of the measurement setup as well as magnetization dynamics not accounted for by the employed coupled Brown-N\'eel rotation model. The algorithm was first validated on synthetic signals at SNR levels of 1 and 10, and then tested on an in-house MPS setup across six viscosity levels (0.89-15.33 mPa.s) and DF frequencies of 0.25-2 kHz using two commercial MNPs. Validation on synthetic signals showed accurate weight and transfer function estimation even at SNR 1. MPS experiments demonstrated successful prediction of MNP signals at untested viscosities, with NRMSE below 1.51% and 3.5% for the two tested MNPs across all DF settings. Predicted signals captured viscosity dependent trends, and NWD values remained low (&lt;0.10 and &lt;0.07 for the two tested MNPs), confirming robust weight estimation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic State Estimation of Power System Utilizing Cauchy Kernel-Based Maximum Mixture Correntropy UKF over Beluga Whale-Bat Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise, outliers, sudden load changes, and bad measurement data are key factors that diminish the accuracy of dynamic state estimation in power systems. Additionally, unscented Kalman filters (UKF) based on correntropy criteria utilize bandwidth-sensitive Gaussian kernels, which may lead to singular matrices in the Cholesky decomposition. To overcome all the above problems, in this paper, a robust UKF based on Cauchy kernel maximum mixture correntropy (CKMMC) criteria over hybrid Beluga Whale-Bat (BWB) optimization (BWB-CKMMC-UKF) is proposed, in which the kernel is merged of two Cauchy functions. Specifically, the measurement error and state error are unified in the cost function by the statistical linearization technique, and the optimal value of state estimation is obtained by fixed-point iteration. Because of its insensitive feature to kernel bandwidth and notable thick-tailed feature, the Cauchy kernel function is utilized instead of the Gaussian kernel in the optimization criteria. Additionally, to fit the power system model, the shape coefficients of the kernel in the CKMMC criterion and scale coefficients that influence the selection of sigma points in the unscented transform are determined based on the BWB algorithm. Simulation results on IEEE 14, 30, and 57-bus test systems validated the performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Beyond Exhaustive Sampling: Efficient Rotational Matching via Ball Harmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-ET allows to generate tomograms of biological samples in situ, capturing complex structures in their native context. Despite low signal-to-noise ratio in reconstructed volumes, the large number of copies of the same macromolecules makes it possible to retrieve high-resolution maps by averaging many aligned subtomograms. To keep up with technical advances in the imaging process and the resulting huge amounts of data available, there is a need for scalable, fast and robust procedures to align subtomograms. We propose a subtomogram alignment framework based on the ball harmonics expansion that combines frequency- and gradient-based optimization strategies to avoid exhaustive rotation sampling, enabling a speed-up of an order of magnitude compared to current approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Fingerprint-based Positioning With Practical Imperfections: Deep learning-based approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision positioning is vital for cellular networks to support innovative applications such as extended reality, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Existing positioning algorithms using deep learning techniques require vast amounts of labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in real-world cellular environments, and these models often struggle to generalize effectively. To advance cellular positioning techniques, the 2024 Wireless Communication Algorithm Elite Competition as conducted, which provided a dataset from a three-sector outdoor cellular system, incorporating practical challenges such as limited labeled-dataset, dynamic wireless environments within the target and unevenly-spaced anchors, Our team developed three innovative positioning frameworks that swept the top three awards of this competition, namely the semi-supervised framework with consistency, ensemble learning-based algorithm and decoupled mapping heads-based algorithm. Specifically, the semi-supervised framework with consistency effectively generates high-quality pseudo-labels, enlarging the labeled-dataset for model training. The ensemble learning-based algorithm amalgamates the positioning coordinates from models trained under different strategies, effectively combating the dynamic positioning environments. The decoupled mapping heads-based algorithm utilized sector rotation scheme to resolve the uneven-spaced anchor issue. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed positioning algorithms compared to existing benchmarks in terms of the {90%, 80%, 67%, 50%} percentile and mean distance error.</description>

      <title>Rigid Body Localization and Tracking for 6G V2X: Algorithms, Applications, and Road to Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) perception refers to a suite of technologies that empower vehicles to sense their environment and communicate with other entities, including surrounding vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud/edge networks. With the growing demands of autonomous driving, V2X perception has gained significant attention, particularly through the emergence of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) frameworks. Within this landscape, rigid body localization (RBL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling the estimation of not only the position and velocity of the targets, but also its three-dimensional (3D) geometric structure and orientation. This article introduces the concept of RBL, highlights its unique advantages and applications, identifies key technical challenges, and finally outlines future research directions. In addition, the potential of RBL in next-generation - e.g. beyond fifth generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) - wireless systems applied to V2X perception is also discussed, with a focus on its role in standardization efforts and its relevance across automotive and industrial domains.</description>

      <title>High-Density MIMO Localization Using a 32x64 Ultrasonic Transducer-Microphone Array with Real-Time Data Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel ultrasonic array system designed for high-precision localization using a large-scale MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) architecture. The system combines 32 transmitters with 62 microphones, creating an extended virtual aperture that improves channel separability and spatial resolution. Each transmitter is excited by a random-phase multisine within the ultrasonic band, which reduces inter-channel correlation and increases robustness against multipath. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through simulations of reflector imaging and analysis of channel separation under realistic transducer bandwidth constraints. Results show that MIMO processing enables improved separation of reflectors compared to single-emitter configurations, although practical limitations such as transducer bandwidth reduce the achievable channel isolation.</description>

      <title>nRTIS: Low-Cost Real-Time 3D Sonar Imaging Circular Array Supporting Beamforming for Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional ultrasonic inspection systems rely on phased arrays and high-performance computing hardware, making them costly, bulky, and unsuitable for portable or embedded use. In this work, we present nRTIS (nano Real-Time 3D Imaging Sonar), a compact ultrasonic sensing platform built around a circular array of MEMS microphones and a central ultrasonic transducer. The device achieves real-time acquisition through an RP2350 microcontroller and high-speed USB transfer. We validate the system using both simulations and controlled experiments: point spread function (PSF) simulations demonstrate beamforming resolution and sidelobe suppression, while reflector measurements confirm robust data acquisition. These results highlight the potential of nRTIS for scalable industrial applications such as weld inspection, pipe mapping, and robotic navigation.</description>

      <title>Rate Optimization for Downlink URLLC via Pinching Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies an ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (uRLLC) downlink system using pinching antennas which are realized by activating small dielectric particles along a dielectric waveguide. Our goal is to maximize the data rate by optimizing the positions of the pinching antennas. By proposing a compact and cost-efficient antenna architecture and formulating a finite blocklength-based optimization model, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal antenna placement under quality-of-service (QoS) and antenna spacing constraints. Meanwhile, a phase-alignment strategy is integrated into the design, enabling coherent signal superposition across the array. Simulation results confirm significant rate improvements over conventional antenna systems while satisfying uRLLC requirements, making the proposed design well-suited for compact and latency-critical future applications.</description>

      <title>SMDS-based Rigid Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a novel rigid body localization (RBL) method, based only on a set of measurements of the distances, as well as the angles between sensors of the vehicle to the anchor landmark points. A key point of the proposed method is to use a variation of the super multidimensional scaling (SMDS) algorithm, where only a minor part of the complex edge kernel is used, based on the available information, which in the case of RBL is anchor-to-anchor and target-to-target information. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the proposed technique in terms of mean square error (MSE) of the estimates, compared also to the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB).</description>

      <title>Comparison between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning in Deep Unfolded Sparse Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of loss function selection in deep unfolding techniques for sparse signal recovery algorithms. Deep unfolding transforms iterative optimization algorithms into trainable lightweight neural networks by unfolding their iterations as network layers, with various loss functions employed for parameter learning depending on application contexts. We focus on deep unfolded versions of the fundamental iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) and the iterative hard thresholding algorithm (IHT), comparing supervised learning using mean squared error with unsupervised learning using the objective function of the original optimization problem. Our simulation results reveal that the effect of the choice of loss function significantly depends on the convexity of the optimization problem. For convex $\ell_1$-regularized problems, supervised-ISTA achieves better final recovery accuracy but fails to minimize the original objective function, whereas we empirically observe that unsupervised-ISTA converges to a nearly identical solution as conventional ISTA but with accelerated convergence. Conversely, for nonconvex $\ell_0$-regularized problems, both supervised-IHT and unsupervised-IHT converge to better local minima than the original IHT, showing similar performance regardless of the loss function employed. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of effective deep unfolded networks for sparse signal recovery applications.</description>

      <title>A James-Stein Estimator based Generalized OMP Algorithm for Robust Signal Recovery using Sparse Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm named JS-gOMP, which enhances the generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (gOMP) algorithm for improved noise robustness in sparse signal processing. The JS-gOMP algorithm uniquely incorporates the James-Stein estimator, optimizing the trade-off between signal recovery and noise suppression. This modification addresses the challenges posed by noise in the dictionary, a common issue in sparse representation scenarios. Comparative analyses demonstrate that JS-gOMP outperforms traditional gOMP, especially in noisy environments, offering a more effective solution for signal and image processing applications where noise presence is significant.</description>

      <title>To Share, or Not to Share: A Study on GEO-LEO Systems for IoT Services with Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of satellite deployments, both in the low and geostationary Earth orbit exacerbates the already ongoing scarcity of wireless resources when targeting ubiquitous connectivity. For the aim of supporting a massive number of IoT devices characterized by bursty traffic and modern variants of random access, we pose the following question: Should competing satellite operators share spectrum resources or is an exclusive allocation preferable? This question is addressed by devising a communication model for two operators which serve overlapping coverage areas with independent IoT services. Analytical approximations, validated by Monte Carlo simulations, reveal that spectrum sharing can yield significant throughput gains for both operators under certain conditions tied to the relative serviced user populations and coding rates in use. These gains are sensitive also to the system parameters and may not always render the spectral coexistence mutually advantageous. Our model captures basic trade-offs in uplink spectrum sharing and provides novel actionable insights for the design and regulation of future 6G non-terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>Non-Identical Diffusion Models in MIMO-OFDM Channel Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model, and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme. Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression. Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Predictive Communications for Low-Altitude Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable low-altitude communication systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Orbital Dynamics with RF Signal Features for Satellite Multi-Orbit Proximity Threat Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity-based interference is a growing threat to satellite communications, driven by dense multi-orbit constellations and increasingly agile adversarial maneuvers. We propose a hybrid simulation framework that integrates orbital maneuver modeling with RF signal degradation analysis to detect and classify suspicious proximity operations. Using the open-source Maneuver Detection Data Generation (MaDDG) library from MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we generate labeled datasets combining impulsive maneuver profiles with radio-frequency (RF) impacts across a range of behavioral intents: routine station-keeping, covert shadowing, and overt jamming. Our approach fuses kinematic features such as range, velocity, acceleration, and Time of Closest Approach (TCA), with RF metrics including Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), throughput, and Jammer-to-Signal Ratio (JSR). These features are further enhanced with temporal derivatives and rolling-window statistics to capture subtle or transient interference patterns. A Random Forest classifier trained on this fused feature set achieves 94.67% accuracy and a macro F1 score of 0.9471, outperforming models using only kinematic or RF inputs. The system is particularly effective in detecting covert threats, such as surveillance or intermittent jamming, that evade RF-only methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient River Water Level Sensing Using Cellular CSI and Joint Space-Time Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and timely water level monitoring is critical for flood prevention, environmental management, and emerging smart infrastructure systems. Traditional water sensing methods often rely on dedicated sensors, which can be costly to deploy and difficult to maintain and are vulnerable to damage during floods.In this work, we propose a novel cellular signalbased sensing scheme that passively estimates water level changes using downlink mobile signals from existing communication infrastructure. By capturing subtle variations in channel state information (CSI), the proposed method estimates the length changes of the water-reflected signal path, which correspond to water level variations. A space-time processing framework is developed to jointly estimate the angle of arrival and Doppler shift, enabling isolation and enhancement of the water-reflected path via beamforming, while effectively suppressing environmental noise. The phase evolution of the beamformed signal is then extracted to infer water level changes. To address clock asynchronism between the transmitter and receiver inherent in bistatic systems, we introduce a beamforming-based compensation technique for removing time-varying random phase offsets in CSI. Field experiments conducted across a river demonstrate that the proposed method enables accurate and reliable water level estimation, achieving a mean accuracy ranging from 1.5 cm to 3.05 cm across different receiver configurations and deployments.</description>

      <title>ECG-Based Stress Prediction with Power Spectral Density Features and Classification Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress has emerged as a critical global health issue, contributing to cardiovascular disorders, depression, and several other long-term illnesses. Consequently, accurate and reliable stress monitoring systems are of growing importance. In this work, we propose a stress prediction framework based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded during multiple daily activities such as sitting, walking, and jogging. Frequency-domain indicators of autonomic nervous system activity were obtained through Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis and utilized as input for machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, deep learning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were directly applied to the raw ECG signals. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of ensemble-based classifiers, with CatBoost achieving 90% accuracy. Moreover, the LSTM model provided superior results, attaining 94% accuracy with balanced precision, recall, and F1-score, reflecting its strength in modeling temporal dependencies in ECG data. Overall, the findings suggest that integrating frequency-domain feature extraction with advanced learning algorithms enhances stress prediction and paves the way for real-time healthcare monitoring solutions.</description>

      <title>On Performance of IoT Networks with Coordinated NOMA Transmission: Covert Monitoring and Information Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the covertness and security performance of Internet-of-Things (IoTs) networks under Rayleigh fading environments. Specifically, a cellular source transmits covert information to cell-edge users with the assistance of an IoT master node, employing a coordinated direct and relay transmission strategy combined with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). This approach not only enhances spectrum utilization but also generates friendly interference to complicate a warden's surveillance or an eavesdropper's decoding efforts. From a covertness perspective, we derive exact closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) under arbitrary judgment thresholds. We then identify the optimal judgment threshold for the worst-case scenario, at which the warden minimizes its DEP performance. Accordingly, we determine the effective region for user power allocation (PA) in NOMA transmission that satisfies the DEP constraint. From a security perspective, we derive analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probability under two eavesdropping strategies using selection combining and maximal ratio combining. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes covert rate while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of legitimate users, the system's minimum covertness requirements, and supporting successive interference cancellation (SIC) procedures. Furthermore, we design an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes the secrecy rate while ensuring the QoS requirements of legitimate users and SIC conditions. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical framework, while the proposed optimization strategies effectively adjust PA coefficients to maximize either the covert rate or the secrecy rate.</description>

      <title>Correlation Analysis Between MF R-Mode Temporal ASF and Meteorological Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have become more widely recognized, the need for complementary navigation systems has grown. Medium frequency ranging mode (MF R-Mode) has gained attention as an effective backup system during GNSS outages, owing to its strong signal strength and cost-effective scalability. However, to achieve accurate positioning, MF R-Mode requires correction for the additional secondary factor (ASF), a propagation delay affected by terrain. The temporal variation of ASF, known as temporal ASF, is typically corrected using reference stations; however, the effectiveness of this method decreases with distance from the reference station. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between temporal ASF and meteorological factors to evaluate the feasibility of predicting temporal ASF based on meteorological factors. Among these factors, temperature and humidity showed significant correlations with temporal ASF, suggesting their potential utility in ASF correction.</description>

      <title>Dual Target-Mounted RISs-Assisted ISAC Against Eavesdropping and Malicious Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synergy between integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) unlocks novel applications and advanced services for next-generation wireless networks, yet also introduces new security challenges. In this study, a novel dual target-mounted RISs-assisted ISAC scheme is proposed, where a base station with ISAC capability performs sensing of two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets, one of which is legitimate and the other is eavesdropper, while communicating with the users through an RIS mounted on the legitimate UAV target. The proposed scheme addresses dual security threats posed by a hostile UAV target: eavesdropping on legitimate user communications and random interference attacks launched by a malicious RIS mounted on this eavesdropper UAV target, aiming to disrupt secure transmissions. A non-convex optimization problem maximizing the secrecy rate of the users is formulated, and a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based two-stage solution is developed to optimize the transmit beamforming matrix of the base station and the phase shift coefficients of the legitimate RIS. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the robustness of the proposed solution under various system configurations. The proposed system's communication performance is assessed using the secrecy rate metric, while the sensing performance is evaluated through the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation of the eavesdropper UAV target.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Based Task-Driven MIMO System for Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while maintaining identical communication overhead.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) at terahertz (THz) frequencies holds significant promise for unifying ultra-high-speed wireless connectivity with fine-grained environmental awareness. Realistic and interpretable channel modeling is essential to fully realize the potential of such systems. This work presents a comprehensive investigation of monostatic sensing channels at 300~GHz, based on an extensive measurement campaign conducted at 57 co-located transceiver (TRx) positions across three representative indoor scenarios. Multipath component (MPC) parameters, including amplitude, delay, and angle, are extracted using a high-resolution space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. To cluster the extracted MPCs, an image-processing-based clustering method, i.e., connected component labeling (CCL), is applied to group MPCs based on delay-angle consistency. Based on the measurement data, an environment-aware channel modeling framework is proposed to establish mappings between physical scenario attributes (e.g., reflector geometry, surface materials, and roughness) and their corresponding channel-domain manifestations. The framework incorporates both specular and diffuse reflections and leverages several channel parameters, e.g., reflection loss, Lambertian scattering, and intra-cluster dispersion models, to characterize reflection behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can reliably extract physical characteristics, e.g., structural and material information, from the observed channel characteristics, offering a promising foundation for advanced THz ISAC channel modeling.</description>

      <title>Affine-Doppler Division Multiplexing for High-Mobility Wireless Communications Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has been regarded as a candidate integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) waveform owing to its superior communication performance, outperforming the Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space (OTFS) that has been researched for a longer time. However, since the above two waveforms are incompatible with each other, the state-of-the-art methods well-designed for OTFS may not be directly applicable to AFDM. This paper introduces a new orthogonal multicarrier waveform, namely Affine-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ADDM), which can provide a generic framework and subsume the existing OTFS and AFDM as a particular case. ADDM modulating information symbols in the Affine-Doppler (A-D) domain based on a two-dimensional (2D) transform can enjoy both excellent unambiguous Doppler and Doppler resolution, which is the same as AFDM but outperforms OTFS. Moreover, benefiting from the 2D transform, the symbols block of ADDM in the A-D domain undergoes a 2D cyclic shift produced by the delay and the Doppler of the channel, similar to the 2D cyclic shift in the delay-Doppler domain of cyclic prefix (CP)-OTFS. This offers a potential to directly apply the state-of-the-art methods well-designed for OTFS and AFDM to ADDM. Numerical results show that ADDM achieves comparable BER performance with AFDM but outperforms OTFS in high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Sensing in Communication-Centric ISAC: Deep Learning and Parametric Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces two novel algorithms designed to address the challenge of super-resolution sensing parameter estimation in bistatic configurations within communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN, employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING, utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the sensing parameters accurately. Through a comprehensive performance analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both algorithms across a range of signal-to-noise ratios, underscoring their applicability in realistic ISAC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Pinching Antenna Systems with Multiple Receive Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation networks require intelligent and robust channel conditions to support ultra-high data rates, seamless connectivity, and large-scale device deployments in dynamic environments. While flexible antenna technologies such as fluid and movable antennas offer some degree of adaptability, their limited reconfiguration range and structural rigidity reduce their effectiveness in restoring line-of-sight (LoS) links. As a complementary solution, pinching antenna systems (PASs) enable fine-grained, hardware-free control of radiation locations along a waveguide, offering enhanced flexibility in challenging propagation environments, especially under non-LoS (NLoS) conditions. This paper introduces a general and novel modeling framework for downlink PASs targeting users equipped with multiple receive antennas, addressing a practical yet underexplored scenario in the existing literature. Specifically, we first derive an analytical relationship between the received signal-to-noise ratio and the pinching antenna (PA) positions, and based on this, we propose a two-layer placement strategy. First, we optimize the central radiation point using large-scale channel characteristics, and then we use a heuristic compressed placement algorithm to approximate phase alignment across multiple receive antennas and select a spatially compact set of active elements. Simulation results demonstrate notable performance gains over conventional single-antenna schemes, particularly in short-range scenarios with dense PAs and widely spaced user antennas.</description>

      <title>Dual-end Fluid Antennas For Robust Anti-jamming in Low-altitude Air-ground Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of co-channel interference and intentional jamming in low-altitude air-ground communications. Since conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems lack spatial adaptability to dynamically balance signal enhancement against interference suppression, we propose a transformative fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted heterogeneous dual-layer transmission architecture. Specifically, a terrestrial base station with FPA serves ground users, while a low altitude-serving base station equipped with FAS communicates with the aerial user, also equipped with FAS, under the attack of a malicious jammer. We formulate a worst-case achievable rate maximization problem for aerial user subject to constraints including quality-of-service for terrestrial users, imperfect jamming directions, minimum antenna separation, etc. To address the non-convex problem, we propose a fractional programming-block coordinate descent algorithm that alternately optimizes the transmit precoders, receive combiner, and antenna positions at both transceiver sides. Convex hull-based approach and geometric boundary method are used to handle the jamming uncertainty and antenna placement constraints in confined spatial regions, respectively. Extensive simulations validate significant performance gains. The FAS achieves up to 56\% higher data rates than FPA under equivalent power constraints. Strategic antenna repositioning demonstrably enhances signal quality while suppressing interference, maintaining robustness across diverse jammer channel uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Interference Management for Integrated Sensing and Communications: A Multiple Access Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique has been considered a key enabler for 6G radio access networks. ISAC fulfills a brand new paradigm shift in wireless networks via the seamless interplay between communication and sensing within a unified network. However, the tight integration of these functionalities inevitably gives rise to various types of interference, posing significant challenges to existing ISAC waveform designs and rendering interference management a critical concern. Inspired by the development trajectory of wireless communications, different multiple access (MA) techniques, such as orthogonal multiple access (OMA), space-division multiple access (SDMA), and more recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources, designing ISAC waveforms, as well as managing inter-user interference and inter-functionality interference in ISAC. Notably, the interplay between MA and ISAC presents mutually beneficial integration. On the one hand, ISAC helps MA techniques better exploit their interference management capability beyond the communication-only networks. On the other hand, different MA techniques serve as promising solutions for inter-functionality and inter-user interference management in ISAC. In this paper, we deliver the first comprehensive tutorial of MA techniques in ISAC networks. Specifically, we illustrate the fundamental principles of ISAC, classify the diverse types of interference in different ISAC systems, and compare MA-assisted ISAC designs, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. Moreover, we provide an outlook on the emerging applications and future research directions of different MA-assisted ISAC.</description>

      <title>Know What, Know Why: Semantic Hazard Communication for Intelligent V2X Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In current vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, roadside units (RSUs) broadcast brief warning messages that alert nearby vehicles to avoid potential hazards. However, these messages lack contextual information on why a warning is issued, leading to excessive caution or inefficient driving behaviors. To avoid such a situation, we propose a semantic-enhanced and explainable V2X (SEE-V2X) system. In the proposed system, RSUs equipped with smart cameras detect obstructions and transmit context-aware messages to vehicles. By understanding both what the hazard is and why it occurs, drivers can make more intelligent decisions based on their specific driving situation. Furthermore, through a real-field demonstration, we show the new "see-through" feature in the proposed system, which enables drivers to visualize hidden pedestrians behind obstacles. We also perform simulations to compare traditional V2X with SEE-V2X under different traffic conditions. The results show that SEE-V2X significantly improves traffic efficiency and reduces unnecessary deceleration.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-air-ground-sea integrated networking (SAGSIN) concept promises seamless global multimedia connectivity, yet two obstacles still limit its practical deployment. Firstly, high-velocity satellites, aerial relays and sea-surface platforms suffer from obsolete channel state information (CSI), undermining feedback-based adaptation. Secondly, data-rate disparity across the protocol stack is extreme: terabit optical links in space coexist with kilobit acoustic under-water links. This article shows that a single large language model (LLM) backbone, trained jointly on radio, optical and acoustic traces, can provide a unified, data-driven adaptation layer that addresses both rapid CSI ageing and severe bandwidth disparity across the SAGSIN protocol stack. Explicitly, an LLM-based long-range channel predictor forecasts the strongest delay-Doppler components several coherence intervals ahead, facilitating near-capacity reception despite violent channel fluctuations. Furthermore, our LLM-based semantic encoder turns raw sensor payloads into task-oriented tokens. This substantially reduces the SNR required for high-fidelity image delivery in a coastal underwater link, circumventing the data rate limitation by semantic communications. Inclusion of these tools creates a medium-agnostic adaptation layer that spans radio, optical and acoustic channels. We conclude with promising open research directions in on-device model compression, multimodal fidelity control, cross-layer resource orchestration and trustworthy operation, charting a path from laboratory prototypes to field deployment.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.</description>

      <title>Realization of Precise Perforating Using Dynamic Threshold and Physical Plausibility Algorithm for Self-Locating Perforating in Oil and Gas Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate depth measurement is essential for optimizing oil and gas resource development, as it directly impacts production efficiency. However, achieving precise depth and perforating at the correct location remains a significant challenge due to field operational constraints and equipment limitations. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Threshold and Physical Plausibility Depth Measurement and Perforation Control (DTPPMP) system, a solution integrated into perforating guns that enables real-time, precise depth measurement and perforation at designated perforating intervals. The system autonomously samples, processes and identifies signals from a casing collar locator (CCL) in situ within oil and gas wells. Casing collar identification is achieved using a lightweight dynamic threshold and physical plausibility algorithm deployed on an embedded platform, which serves as the system's processor. Field tests conducted in an actual oil well in Sichuan, China, demonstrated the DTPPMP's ability to accurately identify casing collar signals, measure depths, and effectively perforate at designated perforating intervals in real-time. The system achieved a perforation variation of less than the length of a single perforating interval and a F1 score of 98.6% for casing collar identification. These results provide valuable recommendations for advancing automation and intelligence in future perforation operations.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Enhanced Secure Communication: Opportunities, Challenges, and Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broadcast nature of wireless communication renders it inherently vulnerable to security threats such as jamming and eavesdropping. While traditional array beamforming techniques help to mitigate these threats, they usually incur high hardware and processing costs, particularly in large-scale arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). In contrast, movable antenna (MA) arrays can fully exploit the channel variation in spatial regions by enabling flexible antenna movement, which has emerged as a promising technology for secure communications. This article provides a magazine-type overview of MA-aided secure communications. Specifically, we first illuminate the promising application scenarios for MA-enhanced secure communication systems. Then, we examine the security advantages of MAs over conventional FPA systems, fundamentally stemming from their ability to adjust channel correlations between legitimate users, eavesdroppers, and jammers. Furthermore, we discuss important technical challenges and their potential solutions related to MA hardware architecture, channel acquisition, and antenna position optimization to realize secure transmissions. Finally, several promising directions for MA-aided secure communications are presented to inspire future research.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Secure Near-Field MIMO Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission in near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where the base station (BS) equipped with an MA array transmits confidential information to a legitimate user under the threat of a potential eavesdropper. To enhance physical layer security (PLS) of the considered system, we aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly designing the hybrid digital and analog beamformers, as well as the positions of MAs at the BS. To solve the formulated non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is introduced by decoupling the original problem into two separate subproblems. Specifically, for the subproblem of designing hybrid beamformers, a semi-closed-form solution for the fully-digital beamformer is first derived by a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm. Subsequently, the digital and analog beamformers are determined by approximating the fully-digital beamformer through the manifold optimization (MO) technique. For the MA positions design subproblem, we utilize the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to iteratively optimize each MA's position while keeping others fixed. Extensive simulation results validate the considerable benefits of the proposed MA-aided near-field beam focusing approach in enhancing security performance compared to the traditional far-field and/or the fixed position antenna (FPA)-based systems. In addition, the proposed scheme can realize secure transmission even if the eavesdropper is located in the same direction as the user and closer to the BS.</description>

      <title>IMU-Enhanced EEG Motion Artifact Removal with Fine-Tuned Large Brain Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion scenarios.</description>

      <title>SC-GIR: Goal-oriented Semantic Communication via Invariant Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks, we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,, and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.</description>

      <title>DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.</description>

      <title>High-resolution single-pixel imaging in real time with iterative or deep learning-based reconstruction enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a compressive single-pixel imaging (SPI) framework for high-resolution image capture in fractions of a second. This framework combines a dedicated sampling strategy with a tailored reconstruction method to enable high-quality imaging of spatially sparse scenes at the native 1024x768 resolution of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The reconstruction process consists of two phases: first, the measured data is processed using the generalized inverse of the measurement matrix for quick image recovery. Then, the spatial sparsity of the scene is leveraged to enhance reconstruction in dense areas, using either an iterative method or a neural network-based approach. With a compression ratio of 0.41% and an image acquisition rate of 6.8 Hz at 22 kHz DMD operation, this framework supports real-time, high-resolution dynamic imaging with the reconstruction that matches the acquisition rate on a mid-tier desktop GPU.</description>

      <title>Green Traffic Engineering for Satellite Networks Using Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations demand routing that simultaneously minimizes energy, guarantees delivery under congestion, and meets latency requirements for time-critical flows. We present a segment routing over IPv6 (SRv6) flexible algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework that consists of three logical slices: an energy-efficient slice (Algo 130), a high-reliability slice (Algo 129), and a latency-sensitive slice (Algo 128). The framework provides a unified mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that combines satellite CPU power, packet delivery rate (PDR), and end-to-end latency into a single objective, allowing a lightweight software-defined network (SDN) controller to steer traffic from the source node. Emulation of Telesat's Lightspeed constellation shows that, compared with different routing schemes, the proposed design reduces the average CPU usage by 73%, maintains a PDR above 91% during traffic bursts, and decreases urgent flow delay by 18 ms between Ottawa and Vancouver. The results confirm Flex-Algo's value as a slice-based traffic engineering (TE) tool for resource-constrained satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Characterization of Load Demand from Electrified Highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrified roadways (ER) equipped with dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) capabilities can patently extend the driving range and reduce the battery size of electric vehicles (EVs). However, due to the spatial arrangement of the transmitter coils in the ER, the DWPT load exhibits frequency content that could excite power system frequency dynamics. In this context, this work aims to study the spectrum of DWPT loads under different traffic conditions. We develop statistical models for EVs moving at constant speeds to identify the location and magnitude of DWPT load harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental frequency is dependent on the ER coil spacing and the average EV speed. In the worst-case yet unlikely scenario that EVs move in a synchronized fashion, the amplitude of harmonics scales with the number of EVs. On the contrary, when EVs move freely, harmonics scale with the square root of the number of EVs. Platoon formations can accentuate harmonics. We also show that for higher-order harmonics, the spectral content around harmonics decreases in magnitude and increases in bandwidth. Despite the simplified models, our analysis offers valuable insights for ER planners and grid operators. Numerical tests using a traffic simulator corroborate some of these insights.</description>

      <title>Federated learning over physical channels: adaptive algorithms with near-optimal guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In federated learning, communication cost can be significantly reduced by transmitting the information over the air through physical channels. In this paper, we propose a new class of adaptive federated stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms that can be implemented over physical channels, taking into account both channel noise and hardware constraints. We establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithms, demonstrating convergence rates that are adaptive to the stochastic gradient noise level. We also demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our algorithms through simulation studies with deep learning models.</description>

      <title>RSMA Assisted ISAC With Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The harsh environment and scarce resources post-disaster drive the equipment to be miniaturized and portable. Based on this, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems play a significant role in providing emergency wireless networks. In order to reduce the hardware cost, a hybrid beamforming (HBF) assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC system, which exploits the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains, is considered in this paper. However, the HBF structure reduces the spatial degrees of freedom, thus leading to increased interference among communication users and radar sensing. To solve this problem, a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) strategy is adopted to enhance the emergency mmWave-ISAC system. We formulate the weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization objective by jointly designing common rate allocation and HBF. Then, we propose the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) coupled with the weighted mean squared error (WMMSE) method to solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that the RSMA-ISAC scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>VSLLaVA: a pipeline of large multimodal foundation model for industrial vibration signal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in general multimodal tasks, they lack the domain-specific knowledge for industrial vibration signal analysis. This paper introduces VSLLaVA, a comprehensive pipeline that utilizes expert knowledge-guided instruction tuning and evaluation to create an end-to-end LMM for signal analysis. To achieve this, we construct a novel Signal-Question-Answer (SQA) dataset using an expert rule-based signal generator. This dataset facilitates a two-stage learning procedure. The first step is efficient instruction fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which imparts specialized signal identification capabilities. Subsequently, we designed a tailored Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the reasoning capabilities and enhance classification robustness. Then, a dual-mode evaluation framework is proposed, combining an LLM referee with expert rules for semantic assessment using quantitative metrics for numerical and textual accuracy, which reveals that VSLLaVA significantly improves performance in signal type identification and parameter analysis, and makes progress in the identification and parameter analysis of fault-related signals. This research demonstrates a viable approach for developing specialized foundational models for complex industrial applications and marks a transition from conventional task-specific systems to a cohesive, interactive foundational model.</description>

      <title>Impact of Reflectors and MIMO on ML-Aided mmWave/sub-THz Blockage Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) communication systems is significantly impaired by sensitivity to sudden blockages. In this work, we employ machine learning (ML) and our physics-based simulation tool to warn about the upcoming blockage tens of 5G frames ahead for highway speeds, providing a sufficient time for a proactive response. Performance of this ML-aided early-warning-of-blockage (ML-EW) algorithm is analyzed for realistic outdoor mobile environments with diverse reflectors and antenna arrays placed at the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) over a range of mmWave and sub-THz frequencies. ML accuracy of about 90% or higher is demonstrated for highway UE, blocker, and reflector speeds, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and frequencies in mmWave/sub-THz range.</description>

      <title>Time-constrained Federated Learning (FL) in Push-Pull IoT Wireless Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training a high-quality Federated Learning (FL) model at the network edge is challenged by limited transmission resources. Although various device scheduling strategies have been proposed, it remains unclear how scheduling decisions affect the FL model performance under temporal constraints. This is pronounced when the wireless medium is shared to enable the participation of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with distinct communication modes: (1) a scheduling (pull) scheme, that selects devices with valuable updates, and (2) random access (push), in which interested devices transmit model parameters. This work investigates the interplay of push-pull interactions in a time-constrained FL setting, where the communication opportunities are finite, with a utility-based analytical model. Using real-world datasets, we provide a performance tradeoff analysis that validates the significance of strategic device scheduling under push-pull wireless access for several practical settings. The simulation results elucidate the impact of the device sampling strategy on learning efficiency under timing constraints.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Radar and Communication with Rate-Splitting Wireless Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless networks are envisioned to facilitate the seamless coexistence of communication and sensing functionalities, thereby enabling the much-touted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm. A key challenge in ISAC is managing inter-functionality interference while maintaining a balanced performance trade-off. In this work, we propose a rate-splitting (RS)-inspired approach to address this challenge in an uplink ISAC scenario, where a base station (BS) serves an uplink communication user while detecting a radar target. We derive inner bounds on the ergodic data information rate for the communication user and the ergodic radar estimation information rate for the sensing target. A closed-form solution is also derived for the optimal power split in RS that maximizes the communication user's performance. Compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA)- and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired approaches, the proposed approach achieves a more favorable sensing-communication trade-off by virtue of the decoding order flexibility introduced through splitting the communication message. Notably, this is the first work to employ an RS-inspired strategy as a general framework for non-orthogonal coexistence of sensing and communication, extending its applicability beyond traditional digital-only settings.</description>

      <title>Acceleration and Parallelization Methods for ISRS EGN Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The enhanced Gaussian noise (EGN) model, which accounts for inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS), has been extensively utilized for evaluating nonlinear interference (NLI) within the C+L band. Compared to closed-form expressions and machine learning-based NLI evaluation models, it demonstrates broader applicability and its accuracy is not dependent on the support of large-scale datasets. However, its high computational complexity often results in lengthy computation times. Through analysis, the high-frequency oscillations of the four-wave mixing (FWM) efficiency factor integrand were identified as a primary factor limiting the computational speed of the ISRS EGN model. To address this issue, we propose an approximation method to derive a closed-form expression for the FWM efficiency factor, which provides both high accuracy and high computational efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that the method proposed in this work could achieve low error levels under high ISRS influence levels, with an absolute mean error (MAE) of approximately 0.0033 dB. Furthermore, a parallel computation strategy targeting independent regions within the integration domain is proposed and optimized, which further significantly improves computing efficiency.</description>

      <title>Modulo Sampling: Performance Guarantees in The Presence of Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the dynamic range and quantization noise power in modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Two modulo ADC systems are considered: (1) a modulo ADC which outputs the folded samples and an additional 1-bit folding information signal, and (2) a modulo ADC without the 1-bit information. A recovery algorithm that unfolds the quantized modulo samples using the extra 1-bit folding information is analyzed. Using the dithered quantization framework, we show that an oversampling factor of $\mathrm{OF} &gt; 3$ and a quantizer resolution of $b &gt; 3$ are sufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples. When these conditions are met, we demonstrate that the mean squared error (MSE) performance of modulo ADC with an extra 1-bit folding information signal is better than that of a conventional ADC with the same number of bits used for amplitude quantization. Since folding information is typically not available in modulo ADCs, we also propose and analyze a recovery algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) that does not require the 1-bit folding information. In this case, we prove that $\mathrm{OF} &gt; 3$ and $b &gt; 3 + \log_2(\delta)$ for some $\delta &gt; 1$ are sufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples. For the two systems considered, we show that, with sufficient number of bits for amplitude quantization, the mean squared error (MSE) of a modulo ADC is $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{OF}^3}\right)$ whereas that of a conventional ADC is only $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{OF}}\right)$. We extend the analysis to the case of simultaneous acquisition of weak and strong signals occupying different frequency bands. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the derived performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Port-LLM: A Port Prediction Method for Fluid Antenna based on Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to address the mobility challenges faced by user equipment (UE) through the implementation of fluid antenna (FA) on the UE side. This approach aims to maintain the time-varying channel in a relatively stable state by strategically relocating the FA to an appropriate port. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces, for the first time, the application of large language models (LLMs) in the prediction of FA ports, presenting a novel model termed Port-LLM. Our proposed method for predicting the moving port of the FA is a two-step prediction method. To enhance the learning efficacy of our proposed Port-LLM model, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology. Additionally, to further exploit the natural language processing capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, we propose a framework named Prompt-Port-LLM, which is constructed upon the Port-LLM architecture and incorporates prompt fine-tuning techniques along with a specialized prompt encoder module. The simulation results show that our proposed models all exhibit strong generalization ability and robustness under different numbers of base station antennas and medium-to-high mobility speeds of UE. In comparison to existing methods, the performance of the port predicted by our models demonstrates superior efficacy. Moreover, both of our proposed models achieve millimeter-level inference speed.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Remote Tracking Through Correlated Observations in Pull-based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the real-time remote tracking problem in a status update system comprising two sensors, two independent information sources, and a remote monitor. The status updating follows a pull-based communication, where the monitor commands/pulls the sensors for status updates, i.e., the actual state of the sources. We consider that the observations are \textit{correlated}, meaning that each sensor's sent data could also include the state of the other source due to, e.g., inter-sensor communications or overlapping monitoring regions. The effectiveness of data communication is measured by a generic distortion, capturing the underlying application goal. We provide optimal command/pulling policies for the monitor that minimize the average weighted sum distortion and transmission cost. Since the monitor cannot fully observe the exact state of each source, we propose a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and reformulate it as a belief MDP problem. We then effectively truncate the infinite belief space and transform it into a finite-state MDP problem, which is solved via relative value iteration. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the derived policy over age-based and deep-Q network baseline policies.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the generation of theoretical correlation matrices with specific sparsity patterns, associated to graph structures. We present a novel approach based on convex optimization, offering greater flexibility compared to existing techniques, notably by controlling the mean of the entry distribution in the generated correlation matrices. This allows for the generation of correlation matrices that better represent realistic data and can be used to benchmark statistical methods for graph inference.</description>

      <title>Introducing Combined Effects of Filtering and ASE Noise in Optical Links Supposing Different Equalization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analytical framework for evaluating filtering penalties in ASE-noise-limited coherent optical links. The model accounts for the cumulative effects of cascaded optical filters, amplifier-induced ASE noise, and transceiver noise, alongside digital equalization at the receiver. By developing a generalized channel representation, we derive closed-form expressions for signal-to-noise ratio degradation under various equalization strategies, including Zero-Forcing Equalizer, Minimum Mean Square Error Equalizer, and Fractionally Spaced Equalizer. These models capture the impact of colored noise resulting from linear filtering and provide both time and frequency-domain insights. The proposed framework is validated through experimental comparisons using accurately modeled optical filters, demonstrating close agreement between theory and practice and offering a robust foundation for system-level performance evaluation in metro-access networks.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Exposing and Jamming Covert Communications via Disco Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covert communications provide a stronger privacy protection than cryptography and physical-layer security (PLS). However, previous works on covert communications have implicitly assumed the validity of channel reciprocity, i.e., wireless channels remain constant or approximately constant during their coherence time. In this work, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco RIS (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, where the DRIS with random and time-varying reflective coefficients acts as a "disco ball", introducing timevarying fully-passive jamming (FPJ). Consequently, the channel reciprocity assumption no longer holds. The DRIS not only jams the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob, but also decreases the error probabilities of Willie's detections, without either Bob's channel knowledge or additional jamming power. To quantify the impact of the DRIS on covert communications, we first design a detection rule for the warden Willie in the presence of time-varying FPJ introduced by the DRIS. Then, we define the detection error probabilities, i.e., the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR), as the monitoring performance metrics for Willie's detections, and the signal-to-jamming-plusnoise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob. Based on the detection rule, we derive the detection threshold for the warden Willie to detect whether communications between Alice and Bob is ongoing, considering the time-varying DRIS-based FPJ. Moreover, we conduct theoretical analyses of the FAR and the MDR at the warden Willie, as well as SJNR at Bob, and then present unique properties of the DRIS-based FPJ in covert communications. We present numerical results to validate the derived theoretical analyses and evaluate the impact of DRIS on covert communications.</description>

      <title>Localized kernel method for separation of linear chirps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator (SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude, SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated signals.</description>

      <title>MMOC: Self-Supervised EEG Emotion Recognition Framework with Multi-Model Online Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, particularly in healthcare and neuroscience. While supervised learning has been widely used, its reliance on manual annotations introduces high costs and potential bias. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by generating labels through pretext tasks. However, high inter-subject variability in EEG signals leads to significant data drift, limiting self-supervised models' generalization across unseen subjects. Traditional domain adaptation (DA) methods require access to target-domain data during training. Although domain generalization (DG) avoids this constraint, it often falls short in handling complex data drift due to limited coverage of possible target distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose MMOC, a self-supervised framework with multi-model online collaboration (MMOC), to achieve online adaptation to unseen data. MMOC trains multiple base models using diverse strategies rooted in reconstruction and contrastive learning, enabling each model to develop distinct generalization capabilities. During inference, MMOC dynamically activates the most suitable model for each test sample via a loss-based routing mechanism that evaluates both contrastive and reconstruction losses. This dual consideration allows for a comprehensive measurement of data drift at both structural and semantic levels. Experimental results on the SEED and Dreamer datasets show that MMOC achieves state-of-the-art performance: 85.39% on SEED, and 68.77% and 69.37% on Dreamer arousal and valence dimensions, respectively. MMOC effectively mitigates inter-subject data drift, offering a practical solution for real-world EEG emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>Towards channel foundation models (CFMs): Motivations, methodologies and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, conventional AI-based models encounter several limitations, such as heavy reliance on labeled data, limited generalization capability, and task-specific design. To address these challenges, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of channel foundation models (CFMs)-a novel and unified framework designed to tackle a wide range of channel-related tasks through a pretrained, universal channel feature extractor. By leveraging advanced AI architectures and self-supervised learning techniques, CFMs are capable of effectively exploiting large-scale unlabeled data without the need for extensive manual annotation. We further analyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and multi-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct advantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised learning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and the combined paradigms. Given that the research on CFMs is still at an early stage, we identify several promising future research directions, focusing on model architecture innovation and the construction of high-quality, diverse channel datasets.</description>

      <title>Direction of Arrival Estimation: A Tutorial Survey of Classical and Modern Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is a fundamental problem in array signal processing with applications spanning radar, sonar, wireless communications, and acoustic signal processing. This tutorial survey provides a comprehensive introduction to classical and modern DOA estimation methods, specifically designed for students and researchers new to the field. We focus on narrowband signal processing using uniform linear arrays, presenting step-by-step mathematical derivations with geometric intuition. The survey covers classical beamforming methods, subspace-based techniques (MUSIC, ESPRIT), maximum likelihood approaches, and sparse signal processing methods. Each method is accompanied by Python implementations available in an open-source repository, enabling reproducible research and hands-on learning. Through systematic performance comparisons across various scenarios, we provide practical guidelines for method selection and parameter tuning. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical implementation, making DOA estimation accessible to beginners while serving as a comprehensive reference for the field. See https://github.com/AmgadSalama/DOA for detail implementation of the methods.</description>

      <title>SyncNet: correlating objective for time delay estimation in audio signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the task of performing robust and reliable time-delay estimation in signals in noisy and reverberating environments. In contrast to the popular signal processing based methods, this paper proposes to transform the input signals using a deep neural network into another pair of sequences which show high cross correlation at the actual time delay. This is achieved with the help of a novel correlation function based objective function for training the network. The proposed approach is also intrinsically interpretable as it does not lose temporal information. Experimental evaluations are performed for estimating mutual time delays for different types of audio signals such as pulse, speech and musical beats. SyncNet outperforms other classical approaches, such as GCC-PHAT, and some other learning based approaches.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Maximization for Movable Antenna Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates energy efficiency maximization for movable antenna (MA)-aided multi-user uplink communication systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption incurred by practical antenna movement. We first examine the special case with a single user and propose an optimization algorithm based on the one-dimensional (1D) exhaustive search to maximize the user's energy efficiency. Moreover, we derive an upper bound on the energy efficiency and analyze the conditions required to achieve this performance bound under different numbers of channel paths. Then, for the general multi-user scenario, we propose an iterative algorithm to fairly maximize the minimum energy efficiency among all users. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving energy efficiency compared to existing MA schemes that do not account for movement-related costs, as well as the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) scheme. In addition, the results show the robustness of the proposed scheme to imperfect channel state information (CSI) and provide valuable insights for practical system deployment.</description>

      <title>Unscented Kalman Filter with a Nonlinear Propagation Model for Navigation Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is a nonlinear estimation algorithm commonly used in navigation applications. The prediction of the mean and covariance matrix is crucial to the stable behavior of the filter. This prediction is done by propagating the sigma points according to the dynamic model at hand. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to propagate the sigma points according to the nonlinear dynamic model of the navigation error state vector. This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach using real sensor data recorded by an autonomous underwater vehicle during several scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter derives a closed-form joint distribution of the first arrival time (FAT) and first arrival position (FAP) in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) systems with drift. Unlike prior work that studied FAT or FAP separately, we obtain an explicit joint probability density function under constant drift and isotropic diffusion in arbitrary dimensions, revealing a nontrivial spatiotemporal coupling. Based on this result, we compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and show that joint observations enable estimation of lateral drift and improve sensitivity to diffusion -- capabilities not attainable with time-only or position-only models.</description>
