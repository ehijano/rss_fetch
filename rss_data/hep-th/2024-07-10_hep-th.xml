      <title>QCD Axion Dark Matter in String Theory: Haloscopes and Helioscopes as Probes of the Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments have the capacity to detect the QCD axion in the next decade, and precisely measure its mass, if it composes the majority of the dark matter. In type IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds in the geometric regime, the QCD axion mass, $m_a$, is strongly correlated with the topological Hodge number $h^{1,1}$. We compute $m_a$ in a scan of $185{,}965$ compactifications of type IIB string theory on toric hypersurface Calabi-Yau threefolds. We compute the range of $h^{1,1}$ probed by different experiments under the condition that the QCD axion can provide the observed dark matter density with minimal fine-tuning. Taking the experiments DMRadio, ADMX, MADMAX, and BREAD as indicative on different mass ranges, the $h^{1,1}$ distributions peak near $h^{1,1}=24.9, \ 65.4, \ 196.8,$ and $310.9,$ respectively. We furthermore conclude that, without severe fine tuning, detection of the QCD axion as dark matter \emph{at any mass} disfavours 80% of models with $h^{1,1} =491$, which is thought to have the most known Calabi-Yau threefolds. Measurement of the solar axion mass with IAXO is the dominant probe of all models with $h^{1,1}\gtrsim 250$. This study demonstrates the immense importance of axion detection in experimentally constraining the string landscape.</description>

      <title>Hunting 3d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SQED in the $\epsilon$-expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models can be studied in the $\epsilon$-expansion by analytically continuing the number of fermionic degrees of freedom to be half-integer. In this work we study the extension of this strategy to gauge theories. We consider $U(1)$ gauge theories with $N_g$ neutral Majorana fermions $\chi_a$, $N_f$ charge-1 bosons $\phi_i$ and $N_f\times N_g$ charge-1 Dirac fermions $\psi_{ia}$ in the $d=4-2\epsilon$ expansion. Analytically continuing to $N_g=\frac12$ schematically matches the Lagrangian and matter content of $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ SQED, and we check whether this match can be made rigorous. We compute anomalous dimensions of $\chi_a$ up to two loops and of meson operators up to one loop at the fixed points, and compare to expectations from SUSY. While we find obstructions to SUSY at small $N_f$, at large $N_f$ the observables approach the expected values at a SUSY fixed point. This may allow for checks of $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ IR dualities between gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Warped AdS$_3$ black hole thermodynamics and the charged Cardy formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the thermodynamic properties of black holes with warped AdS$_3$ asymptotics in topologically massive gravity. The holographically dual theory, often referred to as warped CFT$_2$, exhibits a single copy of the Virasoro-Kac-Moody algebra. Consequently, the asymptotic density of states in the right-moving sector is described by the charged Cardy formula that we review in detail. By defining specific linear combinations of the gravitational thermodynamic potentials, we are able to present the gravitational left- and right-moving on-shell actions directly in the grand-canonical ensemble. This allows us to demonstrate that, apart from the charged Cardy behavior in the right-moving sector, the dual field theory exhibits an additional frozen left-moving state giving rise to non-zero entropy contribution. Our findings elucidate the nature of warped CFTs and reveal subtle yet fundamental differences from the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Testing holographic entropy inequalities in 2+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question of whether holographic entropy inequalities obeyed in static states (by the RT formula) are always obeyed in time-dependent states (by the HRT formula), focusing on the case where the bulk spacetime is 2+1 dimensional. An affirmative answer to this question was previously claimed by Czech-Dong. We point out an error in their proof when the bulk is multiply connected. We nonetheless find strong support, of two kinds, for an affirmative answer in that case. We extend the Czech-Dong proof for simply-connected spacetimes to spacetimes with $\pi_1=\mathbb{Z}$ (i.e. 2-boundary, genus-0 wormholes). Specializing to vacuum solutions, we also numerically test thousands of distinct inequalities (including all known RT inequalities for up to 6 regions) on millions of randomly chosen configurations of regions and bulk spacetimes, including three different multiply-connected topologies; we find no counterexamples. In an appendix, we prove some (dimension-independent) facts about degenerate HRT surfaces and symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping spinning two body problem in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity using worldline QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the WQFT partition function, specifically the eikonal phase in a black hole scattering event in the dynamical Chern-Simons theory, using the techniques of spinning worldline quantum field theory. We consider the scattering of spinning black holes and highlight the necessary details for the calculation of the partition function. We present the $\epsilon$-expansion of the essential two-loop integrals using Integration-by-Parts (IBP) reduction and differential equation techniques, which we then utilize to compute the linear-in-order spin eikonal phase up to 3PM. Additionally, we discuss the dependence of the phase on the spin orientations of the black holes.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Spheres in Stringy Matrix Models: Quantifying Chaos in a Mixed Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a truncation of the BMN matrix model to a configuration of two fuzzy spheres, described by two coupled non-linear oscillators dependent on the mass parameter $\mu$. The classical phase diagram of the system generically ($\mu \neq 0$) contains three equilibrium points: two centers and a center-saddle; as $\mu \to 0$ the system exhibits a pitchfork bifurcation. We demonstrate that the system is exactly integrable in quadratures for $\mu=0$, while for very large values of $\mu$, it approaches another integrable point characterized by two harmonic oscillators. The classical phase space is mixed, containing both integrable islands and chaotic regions, as evidenced by the classical Lyapunov spectrum. At the quantum level, we explore indicators of early and late time chaos. The eigenvalue spacing is best described by a Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner distributions; it dovetails, at the quantum level, the classical results and reemphasizes the notion that the quantum system is mixed. We also study the spectral form factor and the quantum Lyapunov exponent, as defined by out-of-time-ordered correlators. These two indicators of quantum chaos exhibit weak correlations with the Brody distribution. We speculate that the behavior of the system as $\mu \to 0$ dominates the spectral form factor and the quantum Lyapunov exponent, making these indicators of quantum chaos less effective in the context of a mixed phase space.</description>

      <title>Worldline integration of photon amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known for many years that methods inspired by string theory, such as the worldline formalism, allow one to write down integral representations that combine large numbers of Feynman diagrams of different topologies. However, to make this fact useful for state-of-the-art calculations one has to confront non-standard integration problems where neither the known integration techniques for Feynman diagrams nor algebraic manipulation programs are of much help. Here I will give a progress report on this long-term project focussing on photon amplitudes at one and two loops, in vacuum and in external fields.</description>

      <title>Conformal bootstrap and Mirror symmetry of states in Gepner models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two explicit constructions of states in the orbifolds of a product of Minimal $N=(2,2)$ models which are based on twisting by spectral flow, mutual locality and operator algebra requirement. It is shown that these two constructions lead to the Berglund-Hubsh-Krawitz dual orbifold groups which define mirror pairs of isomorphic models. Then we generalize our construction for the orbifolds of Gepner models of superstring compactification and explicitly build IIA/IIB mirror map of the space of states of the superstrings using light-cone gauge.</description>

      <title>The stringy geometry of integral cohomology in mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the physical significance of torsion co-cycles in the cohomology of a projective Calabi-Yau three-fold for the (2,2) superconformal field theory (SCFT) associated to the non-linear sigma model with such a manifold as a target space. There are two independent torsion subgroups in the cohomology. While one is associated to an orbifold construction of the SCFT, the other encodes the possibility of turning on a topologically non-trivial flat gerbe for the NS-NS B-field. Inclusion of these data enriches mirror symmetry by providing a refinement of the familiar structures and points to a generalization of the duality symmetry, where the topology of the flat gerbe enters on the same footing as the topology of the underlying manifold.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Calculation of Entanglement Entropy in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of a massless scalar field in de Sitter space depends on multiple scales, such as the radius of the entangling surface, the Hubble constant and the UV cutoff. We perform a high-precision numerical calculation using a lattice model in order to determine the dependence on these scales in the Bunch-Davies vacuum. We derive the leading de Sitter corrections to the flat-space entanglement entropy for subhorizon entangling radii. We analyze the structure of the finite-size effects and we show that the contribution to the entanglement entropy of the sector of the theory with vanishing angular momentum depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which extends beyond the horizon.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy as a Probe Beyond the Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of a free field in de Sitter space is enhanced by the squeezing of its modes. We show analytically that the expansion induces a term in the entanglement entropy that depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which may extend beyond the horizon. In cosmology the size of the system can be identified with the size of a spatially finite universe, or with the wavelength of the first mode that exited the horizon in the beginning of inflation.</description>

      <title>Wilson Loops and Spherical Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 1/2-BPS Wilson loop operators in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on $d$-dimensional spheres. Their vacuum expectation values can be computed at large $N$ through supersymmetric localisation. The holographic duals are given by back-reacted spherical D-branes. For $d\neq 4$, the resulting theories are non-conformal and correspondingly, the dual geometries do not possess an asymptotic AdS region. The main aim of this work is to compute the holographic Wilson loops by evaluating the partition function of a probe fundamental string and M2-brane in the dual geometry, focusing on the next-to-leading order. Along the way, we highlight a variety of issues related to the presence of a non-constant dilaton. In particular, the structure of the divergences of the one-loop partition functions takes a non-universal form in contrast to examples available in the literature. We devise a general framework to treat the divergences, successfully match the sub-leading scaling with $\lambda$ and $N$, and provide a first step towards obtaining the numerical prefactor.</description>

Abstract: We construct some new brane solutions in M-theory, based on the minimal surfaces. In particular, we consider the anti-self-dual Nutku geometry, and embed it in the membranes and five-branes of the eleven-dimensional supergravity. We explicitly show that the solutions preserve eight supersymmetries. Upon compactification on a circle, we find fully localized intersecting brane systems. We also discuss the T-dual and the decoupling limits of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of interface conformal field theories obtained by taking a large $N$ CFT and turning on a relevant double-trace deformation over half space. At low energies, this leads to a conformal interface separating two CFTs which are related by RG flow. We set up the large $N$ expansion of these models by employing a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation over half space, and use this approach to compute some of the defect CFT data. We also calculate the free energy of the theory in the case of spherical interface, which encodes a conformal anomaly coefficient for even dimensional interface, and the analog of the $g$-function for odd-dimensional interface. These models have a dual description in terms of a gravitational theory in AdS where a bulk scalar field satisfies different boundary conditions on each half of the AdS boundary. We review this construction and show that the results of the large $N$ expansion on the CFT side are in precise agreement with the holographic predictions.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers and Green's functions in black hole space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal interactions play a crucial role in deciphering gravitational wave signals emitted by the coalescence of binary systems. They are usually quantified by a set of complex coefficients which include tidal Love numbers, describing the conservative response to an external perturbation. In the static case, these are found to vanish exactly for asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity in four space-time dimensions, and recently they have been generalized to dynamical interactions. In the context of response theory, the retarded Green's function provides the complete description of the behavior of dynamical systems. In this work we investigate the relation between Love numbers and Green's functions, and highlight the relevance of radiation reaction effects to their connection. As a special case, we discuss BTZ black holes, where the absence of radiative modes allows us to make a direct link between them.</description>

      <title>Towards Beyond Standard Model Model-Building with Reinforcement Learning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model with reinforcement learning using graph representations of new physics theories. The graph structure allows for model-building without a priori specifying definite numbers of new particles. As a case study, we apply our method to a simple class of theories involving vectorlike leptons and a dark U(1) inspired by the portal matter paradigm. Using modern policy gradient methods, the agent successfully explores a model space consisting of both continuous and discrete parameters and identifies consistent theories. The minimal models found include both known and previously unstudied examples that can accommodate the muon anomalous magnetic moment and satisfy precision electroweak and flavor constraints. The method represents a step forward in enabling an automated model-building process for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Graph Reinforcement Learning for Exploring BSM Model Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for performing scans of BSM parameter spaces with reinforcement learning (RL). We identify a novel procedure using graph neural networks that is capable of exploring spaces of models without the user specifying a fixed particle content, allowing broad classes of BSM models to be explored. In theory, the technique is applicable to nearly any model space with a pre-specified gauge group. We provide a generic procedure by which a suitable graph grammar can be developed for any BSM model which features user-specified symmetry groups and a finite number of different possible particle species. As a proof of concept, we construct the graph grammar for theories with vector-like leptons that may or may not be charged under a dark U(1) group, inspired by portal matter extensions of the sub-GeV vector portal/kinetic mixing simplified dark matter models. We then use this graph grammar to create a RL environment tasked with creating models with these vector-like leptons that are consistent with a list of a variety of precision observables. The RL agent succeeds in developing models that can address the observed muon anomalous magnetic moment discrepancy while remaining consistent with flavor violation and electroweak precision observables, including both constructions that have previously been studied as well as new models which have not, to our knowledge, previously been identified. By inspecting the resulting ensembles of models that the agent produces and experimenting with different configurations for our RL environment and graph grammar, we also infer various lessons about the development of these environments that can be transferable to RL scans of more complicated model spaces, and comment on future directions for the development of this technique into a more mature tool.</description>

      <title>The spatial correlations between pulsars for interfering sources in Pulsar Timing Array and evidence for gravitational-wave background in NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), aimed at detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the $1\sim 100$ nHz range, have recently made significant strides. Compelling evidence has emerged for a common spectrum signal spatially correlated among pulsars, following a Hellings-Downs (HD) pattern, which is crucial for detecting a gravitational-wave background (GWB). However, the HD curve is expected for discrete and non-interfering sources, which is unlikely to hold in realistic scenarios with potential interference among numerous GW sources, such as the supermassive black-hole binaries. Incorporating interference was previously expected to introduce an irreducible uncertainty (known as "cosmic variance") in discerning the HD correlation; however, our work reveals how this interference generates measurable frequency-dependent spatial correlations distinct from the HD curve. The spatial correlations for interfering sources (referred to as "ISC") still exhibit contributions in the quadrupole and higher orders, resembling the HD correlation and encoding the nature of GW radiations. We apply these novel correlations to search for a GWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. In an optimistic estimation, our findings show a Bayes factor of $33.7\pm 3.2$ comparing ISC to the HD correlation, and an improvement in optimal statistic signal-to-noise ratio from $4.9\pm 1.1$ for the HD correlation to $6.6\pm 1.7$ for the ISC, highlighting the significant enhancement in evidence for detecting a GWB through incorporating interference.</description>

      <title>Krylov fractality and complexity in generic random matrix ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov space methods provide an efficient framework for analyzing the dynamical aspects of quantum systems, with tridiagonal matrices playing a key role. Despite their importance, the behavior of such matrices from chaotic to integrable states, transitioning through an intermediate phase, remains unexplored. We aim to fill this gap by considering the properties of the tridiagonal matrix elements and the associated basis vectors for appropriate random matrix ensembles. We utilize the Rosenzweig-Porter model as our primary example, which hosts a fractal regime in addition to the ergodic and localized phases. We discuss the characteristics of the matrix elements and basis vectors across the three (ergodic, fractal, and localized) regimes and introduce tools to identify the transition points. The exact expressions of the Lanczos coefficients are provided in terms of $q$-logarithmic function across the full parameter regime. The numerical results are corroborated with analytical reasoning for certain features of the Krylov spectra. Additionally, we investigate the Krylov state complexity within these regimes, showcasing the efficacy of our methods in pinpointing these transitions.</description>

      <title>Shadow of slowly rotating Kalb-Ramond black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real astronomical objects possess spin, yet deriving exact solutions for rotating black holes within gravitational theories is a formidable challenge. To understand the shadow of rotating black holes in Lorentz-violating spacetimes induced by antisymmetric tensor fields, known as Kalb-Ramond (KR) fields, we have focused on the slow-rotation approximation framework. Using this approach, we have obtained first-order rotation series solutions, which describe slowly rotating KR black holes. For this solutions, we have plotted the black hole shadow contours under various parameters using the numerical backward ray-tracing method. As the Lorentz-violating parameter increases, not only the apparent size of the black hole shadow decreases, but also the effects of rotation, such as the D-shaped structure and frame-dragging, are amplified. Furthermore, the KR field also enhances gravitational lensing, causing the shadow to occupy a larger area within the photon ring. This distinctive feature can differentiate KR gravity from general relativity. Additionally, using the latest observational data from EHT on M87* and Sgr A*, we have provided constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter of rotating KR black holes. We found that, compared to static black holes, rotating black holes allow for the presence of stronger Lorentz violation effects.</description>

      <title>Radiative symmetry breaking from the on-shell perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models with classical scale symmetry, which feature radiative symmetry breaking, generically lead to a supercooled first-order phase transition in the early Universe resulting in a strong gravitational-wave signal, potentially observable by LISA. This is thanks to the absence of mass terms in the potential and the resulting logarithmic structure of the zero-temperature effective potential. It is known that imposing a symmetry at classical level does not prohibit breaking it by quantum corrections. In the case of scale symmetry, a mass term can in principle appear through renormalisation. This is not the case in the commonly used $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ or Coleman-Weinberg schemes. In this work, we renormalise a scale-invariant model in the on-shell scheme to check whether parameterising it with the physical masses will introduce mass terms to the potential. We find that indeed mass terms appear for an arbitrary choice of the physical masses. However, we formulate an on-shell condition for radiative symmetry breaking, sufficient and necessary for the cancellation of mass terms in the renormalised potential, yielding a logarithmic potential needed for supercooled phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an argument about the origin of escort distributions used in conjunction with the q-entropy in non-additive thermo-statistics. The origin of the escort distributions is ascribed to the fact that the effective statistical description of the underlying system is provided by the measured Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of manifolds having a warped product metric structure. We interpret the entropic parameter \ q \ appearing in escort distributions as a "dimension" related to the fibration structure of the underlying phase spaces.</description>

      <title>Universal nonlinear responses of quantum Hall systems with Galilean invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems with Galilean invariance gapped under magnetic fields. When such quantum Hall systems are coupled with external sources for charge, energy, and momentum currents, they exhibit invariance under the Milne boost as well as under the gauge and general coordinate transformations. We construct the most general effective action consistent with all the symmetries in the derivative expansion, where an electric field is regarded as order of unity so as to allow for nonlinear responses. The resulting action is shown to consist of four terms proportional to the Hall conductivity and viscosity and the energy density and magnetization. We then compute the local currents induced by electromagnetic fields, revealing universal relations among distinct kinds of responses. In particular, we find the Hall conductivity determining the longitudinal conductivity at nonzero frequency and the Hall viscosity contributing to the nonlinear electrothermal conductivity at nonzero wave number.</description>

      <title>Spectral Statistics, Hydrodynamics and Quantum Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the central problems in many-body physics, both classical and quantum, is the relations between different notions of chaos. Ergodicity, mixing, operator growth, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and spectral chaos are defined in terms of completely different objects in different contexts, don't necessarily co-occur, but still seem to be manifestations of closely related phenomena. In this dissertation, we study the relation between two notions of chaos: thermalization and spectral chaos. We define a quantity called the Total Return Probability (TRP) which measures how a system forgets its initial state after time $T$, and show that it is closely connected to the Spectral Form Factor (SFF), a measure of chaos deriving from the energy level spectrum of a quantum system. The main thrust of this work concerns hydrodynamic systems -- systems where locality prevents charge or energy from spreading quickly, this putting a throttle on thermalization. We show that the detailed spacings of energy levels closely capture the dynamics of these locally conserved charges. We also study spin glasses, a phase of matter where the obstacle to thermalization comes not from locality but from the presence of too many neighbors. Changing one region requires changing nearby regions which requires changing nearby-to-nearby regions, until only catastrophic realignments of the whole system can fully explore phase space. In spin glasses we find our clearest analytic link between thermalization and spectral statistics. We analytically calculate the spectral form factor in the limit of large system size and show it is equal to the TRP. Finally, in the conclusion, we discuss some ideas for the future of both the SFF and the TRP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on gravitational perturbations of black holes in the self-accelerating branch of the Minimal Theory of Massive Gravity (MTMG). This theory is a healthy extension of GR which displays the feature of massive tensor modes, without additional polarizations, strong-coupling issues nor requiring screening mechanisms. We proceed by implementing a newly developed technique that, instead of considering a second-order Schr\"odinger-like reformulation of perturbation equations, relies on a first-order formulation and solves it asymptotically, before numerically deriving the quasi-normal modes. We find that the black holes of MTMG are stable, and that their quasi-normal modes smoothly differ from the GR ones, for non-vanishing values of the graviton mass. This work hence confirms the fact that GR is a smooth limit of MTMG, and opens the exciting possibility of a clean test, performed for instance by the LISA detector.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of splitting of the chiral and deconfinement transition due to rotation in QCD: the phase diagram of linear sigma model coupled to Polyakov loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of rigid rotation on critical temperatures of deconfinement and chiral transitions in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks and the Polyakov loop. We point out the essential role of the causality condition, which requires that any point of the system should rotate slower than the velocity of light. We show that imposing this physical requirement leads to inhibition of the splitting between the chiral and confining transitions, which becomes negligibly small ($\Delta T \sim 1$~MeV or less) for experimentally relevant, slow angular velocities $\Omega \sim 10$~MeV of a $(5-10)$~fm-sized systems. Moreover, the boundedness of the system has a much bigger effect on temperature splitting than the rotation itself: the splitting reaches 10~MeV in a small, one-fermi-sized non-rotating system. The temperature splitting may, however, become enhanced in an academic limit of ultra-relativistic regimes when the boundary of the system rotates at near-to-light velocities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating bosonic dark matter halos are considered as potential candidates for modeling dark matter in galactic halos. These bosonic dark matter halos can be viewed as a dilute and very extended version of bosonic stars, and the methods used for the calculation and analysis of the latter objects can be directly applied. Bosonic stars, a hypothetical type of astrophysical objects, are categorized into two primary families, based on the nature of the particles composing them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon stars and Proca stars. We examine various models from both families and the rotation curves which their contribution induces in different galaxies, to identify the most plausible candidates that explain the flattening of orbital velocities observed in galactic halos. By exploring different combinations of our dark matter models with observable galactic features, we propose an interesting source to compensate for the apparent lack of matter in dwarf and spiral galaxies, providing a possible explanation for this longstanding astronomical puzzle.</description>

Abstract: We re-consider the graviton self-energy induced by a loop of massless, minimally coupled scalars on de Sitter background. On flat space background it can be represented as a sum of two tensor differential operators acting on scalar structure functions. On a general background these tensor differential operators can be constructed from the linearized Ricci scalar and the linearized Weyl tensor. However, in cosmology one requires a third contribution which we derive here.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Preference for Negative Neutrino Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most precise determination of the sum of neutrino masses from cosmological data, derived from analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), favors a value below the minimum inferred from neutrino flavor oscillation experiments. We explore which data is most responsible of this puzzling aspect of the current constraints on neutrino mass and whether it is related to other anomalies in cosmology. We demonstrate conclusively that the preference for negative neutrino masses is a consequence of larger than expected lensing of the CMB in both the two- and four-point lensing statistics. Furthermore, we show that this preference is robust to changes in likelihoods of the BAO and CMB optical depth analyses given the available data. We then show that this excess clustering is not easily explained by changes to the expansion history and is likely distinct from the preference for for dynamical dark energy in DESI BAO data. Finally, we discuss how future data may impact these results, including an analysis of Planck CMB with mock DESI 5-year data. We conclude that the negative neutrino mass preference is likely to persist even as more cosmological data is collected in the near future.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we will analyze a quantum deformation of cubic string field theory. This will be done by first constructing a quantum deformation of string theory, in a covariant gauge, and then using the quantum deformed stringy theory to construct a quantum deformation of string field theory. This quantum deformed string field will then be used to contract a quantum deformed version of cubic string field theory. We will explicitly demonstrate that the axioms of cubic string field theory hold even after quantum deformation. Finally, we will analyze the effect of the quantum deformation of string field theory on the string vertices.</description>

Abstract: We show that extremal Kerr black holes are sensitive probes of new physics. Stringy or quantum corrections to general relativity are expected to generate higher-curvature terms in the gravitational action. We show that in the presence of these terms, asymptotically flat extremal rotating black holes have curvature singularities on their horizon. Furthermore, near-extremal black holes can have large yet finite tidal forces for infalling observers. In addition, we consider five-dimensional extremal charged black holes and show that higher-curvature terms can have a large effect on the horizon geometry.</description>

Abstract: The Page curve exhibits a sharp peak at the Page time corresponding to a phase transition from an empty quantum extremal surface to a non-empty one. This study delves into the impact of this phase transition on the informational content of black hole radiation through constructing a smooth Page curve which represents a gradual transition instead. We utilize replica trick, apply holography in a specific form, and introduce mathematical identities inherent to the curve's smoothness. Our results suggest that a gradual transition could lead to a significant increase in the informational content of the radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study holographic entropy inequalities and their structural properties by making use of a judicious grouping of terms into certain multipartite information quantities. This allows us to recast cumbersome entropic expressions into much simpler ones which share interestingly rigid structures. By performing a systematic search over some of these structures, we are able to discover more than 300 novel entropy inequalities for six parties, thereby demonstrating that these recastings provide a fruitful generating technique for uncovering new holographic entropy inequalities. In attempting to interpret the corresponding sign-definite quantities as correlation measures, we also obtain a no-go result: the superbalance property of holographic entropy inequalities turns out to preclude them from being monotonic under partial tracing. In the process, we also comment on the geometrical significance of multipartite information quantities and present various structural relations amongst them.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the possibility that, starting from a relativistic Hermitian quantum field theory in the ultraviolet (UV) regime, and applying a non-perturbative renormalization-group (RG) flow, we arrive at a situation where there are infrared (IR) singularities in the RG flow of couplings. The latter can be resolved by assuming that the theory can have a phase described by a related non-Hermitian PT-symmetric modification in the IR. The UV-to-IR (Hermitian-to-PT-symmetric) transition can occur in a single renormalization-group flow of the pertinent couplings, as demonstrated in concrete examples. When embedded in a gravitational setting such a transition can lead to a repulsive gravity phase. If there is a RG flow to a repulsive PT -symmetric gravity, then this would be an alternative to dark energy. The discussion here is presented in the context of a string-inspired Chern-Simons gravitational effective action, which involves a pseudoscalar (axion-like) field coupled to Abelian gauge fields and gravity; it may also hold more generally in gravity with torsion. The validity of such a scenario in realistic theories might alleviate the need for de Sitter phases in the current epoch of cosmological evolution, thus avoiding their associated conceptual and technical complications.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry of N=2 Minkowski Vacua of Gauged N=2 Supergravity Theories in Four Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauging isometries of four-dimensional N=2 supergravity theories yields an N=2 supersymmetric theory with a scalar potential. In this note, we study the well-known constraints for four-dimensional N=2 Minkowski vacua of such theories. We propose that classically a projective special K\"ahler submanifold of the projective K\"ahler target space of the ungauged theory describes the moduli space of the complex scalar fields of massless vector multiplets for N=2 Minkowski vacua configurations, which then receives quantum corrections from integrating out massive fields. Subloci of projective special K\"ahler manifolds appear as supersymmetric flux vacua in the context of type IIB Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications with background fluxes as well. While these flux vacua equations arise from the critical locus of an N=1 superpotential, we show that these equations can also be obtained from the N=2 supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum equations of gauged N=2 supergravity theories upon gauging suitable isometries in the semi-classical universal hypermultiplet sector of type IIB string Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications. Thus, we give an intrinsic N=2 supersymmetric interpretation to the flux vacua equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relation between generalised K\"ahler geometry and $N=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models in two dimensions formulated in terms of $(2,2)$ superfields. Dual formulations in terms of different kinds of superfield are combined to give a formulation with a doubled target space and both the original superfield and the dual superfield. For K\"ahler geometry, we show that this doubled geometry is Donaldson's deformation of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of the original K\"ahler manifold. This doubled formulation gives an elegant geometric reformulation of the equations of motion. We interpret the equations of motion as the intersection of two Lagrangian submanifolds (or of a Lagrangian submanifold with an isotropic one) in the infinite dimensional symplectic supermanifold which is the analogue of phase space. We then consider further extensions of this formalism, including one in which the geometry is quadrupled, and discuss their geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the entropy behavior of the de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. A cosmological horizon in de Sitter spacetime that constrains the causally accessible region of an observer exhibits thermal properties analogous to the event horizon of a black hole. According to the principles of holography, the entropy within a causally connected region for an observer is limited by its boundary. This entropy bound is violated during the late inflation stage. To address the issue of entropy bound violations from a quantum information perspective, we adopted a stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. We consider Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of the inflaton field, which shows the same behavior as the entanglement entropy of a Hubble-size region in stochastic inflation. Adopting the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we show a meaningful entropy behavior in the de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite-size spectrum of the critical staggered six-vertex model with antidiagonal boundary conditions is studied. Similar to the case of periodic boundary conditions, we identify three different phases. In two of those, the underlying conformal field theory can be identified to be related to the twisted $U(1)$ Kac-Moody algebra. In contrast, the finite size scaling in the third regime, whose critical behaviour with the (quasi-)periodic BCs is related to the 2d black hole CFTs possessing a non-compact degree of freedom, is more subtle. Here with antidiagonal BCs imposed, the corrections to the scaling of the ground state grow logarithmically with the system size, while the energy gaps appear to close logarithmically. Moreover, we obtain an explicit formula for the Q-operator which is useful for numerical implementation.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we bootstrap the 4-point correlators on the 1D celestial circle using 3D symmetries in the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory as constraints. We find that the dual inversion property is strong enough to replace the crossing symmetry condition (or cyclic invariant condition) when bootstrapping. We also give some results about the conformal block expansion coefficients which contain the spectrum and the leading multi-OPE of this celestial CFT. Furthermore, we find a non-local 2-particle operator from the multi-OPE at the leading OPE. Although we studied a specific theory, the methods used are valid for general cases. Finally, we try to find how the relations between the Grassmannians of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory and the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory with reduced supersymmetry are realized on the celestial sphere in the four-point case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular Berry transport is a useful way to understand how geometric bulk information is encoded in the boundary CFT: The modular curvature is directly related to the bulk Riemann curvature. We extend this approach by studying modular transport in the presence of a non-trivial quantum extremal surface. Focusing on JT gravity on an AdS background coupled to a non-gravitating bath, we compute the modular curvature of an interval in the bath in the presence of an island: the Quantum Extremal Modular Curvature (QEMC). We highlight some important properties of the QEMC, most importantly that it is non-local in general. In an OPE limit, the QEMC becomes local and probes the bulk Riemann curvature in regions with an island. Our work gives a new approach to probe physics behind horizons.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental step towards studying string theory vacua, and, ultimately, their stability, is that of understanding the underlying mathematical structure of the QFT resulting from its dimensional reduction on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds, the latter being complex manifolds admitting a category theory description. The present work aims at addressing this question in the case of lower-dimensional gravitating systems, and supersymmetric quiver gauge theories, highlighting the role played by dualities and categorical structures towards studying analytical structures of amplitudes.

Abstract: We connect the indications of 2D CFT for branes in non-supersymmetric strings to actual spacetime profiles, taking the bulk tadpole potentials into account. We find exact solutions for the uncharged branes that spread in the internal intervals of Dudas-Mourad vacua for non-tachyonic orientifolds and heterotic strings. These solutions involve suitable dressings of the uncharged branes of the nine-dimensional tadpole-free theory. Similar exact results for uncharged branes that are transverse to the internal space, or for charged branes, appear more challenging. Nevertheless, we identify their large-distance behavior, which is determined by linearized equations, and show that it is compatible with the CFT analysis in all expected cases. We also draw some indications on the leading back-reaction of the form-fields.</description>

Abstract: We consider irrelevant deformations of massless RSOS scattering theories by an infinite number of higher TTbar_{s+1} operators which introduce extra non-trivial CDD factors between left-movers and right-movers. It is shown that the resulting theories can be UV complete after bypassing typical Hagedorn-like singularities if the coefficients of the deformations are fine-tuned. In this way, we have discovered that only two new UV complete QFTs are associated with a M_p (p=3,4,...) minimal CFT based on the integrable structure of the RSOS scattering theory. One is the massless Z_{p-1} parafermionic sinh-Gordon models (PShG) with a self-dual coupling constant. This correspondence is confirmed by showing that the scale-dependent vacuum energies computed by the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz based on the S-matrices match those from the quantization conditions for the PShG models using the reflection amplitudes. The other UV QFT is reached from M_p by following the roaming trajectory of the Z_{p-1} parafermionic minimal series.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole to investigate the process of scalar wave scattering by the black hole in a spacetime of (d + 1) dimensions and also with the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). In this scenario, we analytically determine the phase shift and explore the effect of extra dimensions by calculating the differential scattering and absorption cross-section by applying the partial wave method at low and high-frequency limits. We show at high dimensions that the absorption is not zero as the mass parameter approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Matter from Dynamical Heating of Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarfs. Part 1: MACHOs and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We place limits on dark matter made up of compact objects significantly heavier than a solar mass, such as MACHOs or primordial black holes (PBHs). In galaxies, the gas of such objects is generally hotter than the gas of stars and will thus heat the gas of stars even through purely gravitational interactions. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) maximize this effect. Observations of the half-light radius in UFDs thus place limits on MACHO dark matter. We build upon previous constraints with an improved heating rate calculation including both direct and tidal heating, and consideration of the heavier mass range above $10^4 \, M_\odot$. Additionally we find that MACHOs may lose energy and migrate in to the center of the UFD, increasing the heat transfer to the stars. UFDs can constrain MACHO dark matter with masses between about $10 M_\odot$ and $10^8 M_\odot$ and these are the strongest constraints over most of this range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09249v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit Duff, Okun, and Veneziano's divergent views on the number of fundamental constants and argue that the issue can be set to rest by having spacetime as the starting point. This procedure disentangles the resolution in what depends on the assumed spacetime (whether relativistic or not) from the theories built over it. By defining that the number of fundamental constants equals the minimal number of independent standards necessary to express all observables, as assumed by Duff, Okun, and Veneziano, it is shown that the same units fixed by the apparatuses used to construct the spacetimes are enough to express all observables of the physical laws defined over them. As a result, the number of fundamental constants equals two in Galilei spacetime and one in relativistic spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a group field theory (GFT) for quantum gravity coupled to four massless scalar fields, using these matter fields to define a (relational) coordinate system. We exploit symmetries of the GFT action, in particular under shifts in the values of the scalar fields, to derive a set of classically conserved currents, and show that the same conservation laws hold exactly at the quantum level regardless of the choice of state. We propose a natural interpretation of the conserved currents which implies that the matter fields always satisfy the Klein--Gordon equation in GFT. We then observe that in our matter reference frame, the same conserved currents can be used to extract all components of an effective GFT spacetime metric. Finally, we apply this construction to the simple example of a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic universe, where we derive an effective Friedmann equation directly from this metric. The Friedmann equation displays a bounce and a late-time limit equivalent to general relativity with a single scalar field. Our proposal goes substantially beyond the GFT literature in which only specific geometric quantities such as the total volume or volume perturbations could be defined, opening up the possibility to study more general geometries as emerging from GFT.</description>

Abstract: We perform a phenomenological comparison of the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum expected from cosmic gauge string networks and superstring networks comprised of multiple string types. We show how violations of scaling behavior and the evolution of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe affect the GW spectrum. We derive simple analytical expressions for the GW spectrum from superstrings and gauge strings that are valid for all frequencies relevant to pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and laser interferometers. We analyze the latest data from PTAs and show that superstring networks are consistent with 32 nHz data from NANOGrav, but are excluded by 3.2 nHz data at $3\sigma$ unless the string coupling $g_s&lt;0.2$ or the strings evolve in only about 10% of the volume of the higher-dimensional space. We also point out that while gauge string networks are excluded by NANOGrav-15 data at $3\sigma$, they are completely compatible with EPTA and PPTA data. Finally, we study correlations between GW signals at PTAs and laser interferometers.</description>

      <title>Hexadecapole at the heart of nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical Maxwell's electromagnetism, monopole term of the electric field is proportional to $r^{-2}$, while higher order multipole terms, sourced by anisotropic sources, fall-off faster. However, in nonlinear electromagnetism even a spherically symmetric field has multipole-like contributions. We prove that the leading subdominant term of the electric field, defined by nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian obeying Maxwellian weak field limit, in a static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat spacetime, is of the order $O(r^{-6})$ as $r \to \infty$. Moreover, using Lagrange inversion theorem and Fa\`a di Bruno's formula, we derive the series expansion of the electric field from the Taylor series of an analytic electromagnetic Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum field theories on continuous-variable quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We delve into the use of photonic quantum computing to simulate quantum mechanics and extend its application towards quantum field theory. We develop and prove a method that leverages this form of Continuous-Variable Quantum Computing (CVQC) to reproduce the time evolution of quantum-mechanical states under arbitrary Hamiltonians, and we demonstrate the method's remarkable efficacy with various potentials. Our method centres on constructing an evolver-state, a specially prepared quantum state that induces the desired time-evolution on the target state. This is achieved by introducing a non-Gaussian operation using a measurement-based quantum computing approach, enhanced by machine learning. Furthermore, we propose a framework in which these methods can be extended to encode field theories in CVQC without discretising the field values, thus preserving the continuous nature of the fields. This opens new avenues for quantum computing applications in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Understanding the SM gauge group from SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss heavy particles that can be used to pin down the faithful Standard Model (SM) gauge group and their patterns in the SM effective field theory (SMEFT). These heavy particles are not invariant under a specific $\mathbb{Z}_6$ subgroup of $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, which however acts trivially on all the SM particles, hence the faithful SM gauge group remains undetermined. Different realizations of the faithful SM gauge group correspond to different spectra of heavy particles, and they also correspond to distinct sets of line operators with one-form global symmetry acting on them. We show that the heavy particles not invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ group cannot appear in tree-level ultraviolet completions of SMEFT, this enforces us to consider one-loop UV completions of SMEFT to identify the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ non-invariant heavy particles. We demonstrate with examples that correlations between Wilson coefficients provide an efficient way to examine models with $\mathbb{Z}_6$ non-invariant heavy particles. Finally, we prove that all the scalars that can trigger electroweak symmetry breaking must be invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_6$ group, hence they cannot be used to probe the faithful SM gauge group.</description>

      <title>Approaching the conformal limit of quark matter with different chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom in modified Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I discuss the issue of degrees of freedom in modified teleparallel gravity. These theories do have an extra structure on top of the usual (pseudo)Riemannian manifold, that of a flat parallel transport. This structure is absolutely abstract and unpredictable (pure gauge) in GR-equivalent models, however it becomes physical upon modifications. The problem is that, in the most popular models, this local symmetry is broken but not stably so, hence the infamous strong coupling issues. The Hamiltonian analyses become complicated and with contradictory results. A funny point is that what we see in available linear perturbation treatments of $f(T)$ gravity is much closer to the analysis with less dynamical degrees of freedom which has got a well-known mistake in it, while the more accurate work predicts much more of dynamics than what has ever been seen up to now. I discuss possible reasons behind this puzzle, and also argue in favour of studying the most general New GR models which are commonly ignored due to suspicion of ghosts.</description>

      <title>Optical reflection signature of an axion dielectric with magnetic current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the reflection properties on the interface between an ordinary dielectric medium and a dielectric supporting a magnetic current (equivalent to a dielectric governed by axion electrodynamics). Considering the usual Maxwell equations and constitutive relations, we derive the general Fresnel coefficients for reflection for an incident wave with $s$ and $p$ polarization, assuming an isotropic magnetic current on a dielectric substrate. We determine all total internal reflection and critical angles (Brewster angles) conditions, which are given by strict relations between all relevant electromagnetic quantities of the system and the frequency. For $s$- and $p$-polarized incident waves, total internal reflection can occur under certain conditions on the constitutive parameters (for each propagating mode) at specific frequency windows and certain incidence angle intervals. All possible conditions to define critical angles for null reflection are determined. This scenario allows polarization changes by reflection. Considering a $p$-polarized incident wave, the frequency and the Brewster angle, allowing null reflection for both propagating modes, are determined. The Goos-H\"anchen shift and the complex Kerr rotation are also evaluated. The Kerr ellipticity angle presents a frequency-dependent behavior, also reported in Weyl semimetals, having maximum values $\eta_{Kerr}=\pm \pi/4$ for specific values of frequency, which may work as a signature of this axion chiral dielectric.</description>
