      <title>Auction theory and demography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In economics, there are many ways to describe the interaction between a "seller" and a "buyer". The most common one, with which we interact almost every day, is selling for a fixed price. This option is perfect for selling a mass product, when we have a number of sellers and many buyers, and the price for the product varies depending on the conditions of the relationship between supply and demand. Another situation meets us already in markets, where a product can be either mass-produced or more unique, so this option is already closer to the object of our discussion.However, a one-on-one transaction is a much more unstable option, which is why it is also more difficult to model, since it is determined not so much by algorithms as by psychology and the difference in the bargaining ability of the two parties. An even closer example of an auction is price discrimination, when the price for the buyer is determined not only by supply and demand, but also by which group the buyer belongs to. But in this case, the product is not unique, and the final seller is the only one. Thus, we have identified the main auction criteria and their features of the "game".</description>

      <title>Large Language Models in Finance: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for artificial intelligence applications in finance. In this paper, we provide a practical survey focused on two key aspects of utilizing LLMs for financial tasks: existing solutions and guidance for adoption.
  First, we review current approaches employing LLMs in finance, including leveraging pretrained models via zero-shot or few-shot learning, fine-tuning on domain-specific data, and training custom LLMs from scratch. We summarize key models and evaluate their performance improvements on financial natural language processing tasks.
  Second, we propose a decision framework to guide financial professionals in selecting the appropriate LLM solution based on their use case constraints around data, compute, and performance needs. The framework provides a pathway from lightweight experimentation to heavy investment in customized LLMs.
  Lastly, we discuss limitations and challenges around leveraging LLMs in financial applications. Overall, this survey aims to synthesize the state-of-the-art and provide a roadmap for responsibly applying LLMs to advance financial AI.</description>
