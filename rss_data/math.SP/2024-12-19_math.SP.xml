      <title>Gap Labels and Asymptotic Gap Opening for Full Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss gap labelling for operators generated by the full shift over a compact subset of the real line. The set of Johnson--Schwartzman gap labels is the algebra generated by weights of clopen subsets of the support of the single-site distribution. Due to the presence of a dense set of periodic orbits, it is impossible to find a sampling function for which all gaps allowed by the gap labelling theorem open simultaneously. Nevertheless, for a suitable choice of the single-site distribution, we show that for generic sampling functions, every spectral gap opens in the large-coupling limit. Furthermore, we show that for other choices of weights there are gaps that cannot open for purely diagonal operators.</description>

      <title>Spectrally accurate fully discrete schemes for some nonlocal and nonlinear integrable PDEs via explicit formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct fully-discrete schemes for the Benjamin-Ono, Calogero-Sutherland DNLS, and cubic Szeg\H{o} equations on the torus, which are $\textit{exact in time}$ with $\textit{spectral accuracy}$ in space. We prove spectral convergence for the first two equations, of order $K^{-s+1}$ for initial data in $H^s(\mathbb T)$, with an error constant depending $\textit{linearly}$ on the final time instead of exponentially. These schemes are based on $\textit{explicit formulas}$, which have recently emerged in the theory of nonlinear integrable equations. Numerical simulations show the strength of the newly designed methods both at short and long time scales. These schemes open doors for the understanding of the long-time dynamics of integrable equations.</description>

      <title>Approximation by orthonormal polynomials associated with even exponential weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a quantitative approximation result by orthonormal polynomials associated to an exponential weight of the form e -$\Phi$ , where $\Phi$ is an even polynomial with positive leading coefficient. This result is a consequence of a recursion relation for the orthonormal polynomials and of the strong Poincar{\'e} inequality. Simulations are provided at the end of the article, on smooth, non-smooth functions as well as in the Gaussian and the double well case.</description>

      <title>Notions of entropy for unitary representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last twenty years, Lewis Bowen's sofic entropy and its annealed version (originally called the `f-invariant') have taken a central place in the ergodic theory of actions of non-amenable groups. In this work we pursue these notions of entropy across the analogy between ergodic theory and representation theory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of groups and representations of other C*-algebras. We find connections to both classical constructs in operator theory and the study of tuples of independent random unitary matrices.</description>

      <title>A few sharp estimates of harmonic functions with applications to Steklov eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On smooth compact manifolds with smooth boundary, we first establish the sharp lower bounds for the restrictions of harmonic functions in terms of their frequency functions, by using a combination of microlocal analysis and frequency function techniques by Almgren and Garofalo-Lin. The lower bounds can be saturated by Steklov eigenfunctions on Euclidean balls and a family of symmetric warped product manifolds. Moreover, as in Sogge and Taylor, we analyze the interior behavior of harmonic functions by constructing a parametrix for the Poisson integral operator and calculate its composition with the spectral cluster. By using microlocal analysis, we obtain several sharp estimates for the harmonic functions whose traces are quasimodes on the boundary. As applications, we establish the almost-orthogonality, bilinear estimates and transversal restriction estimates for Steklov eigenfunctions, and discuss the numerical approximation of harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Bessel functions and Weyl's law for balls and spherical shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. One is to investigate the properties of the zeros of cross-products of Bessel functions or derivatives of ultraspherical Bessel functions, as well as the properties of the zeros of the derivative of the first-kind ultraspherical Bessel function. The properties we study include asymptotics (with uniform and nonuniform remainder estimates), upper and lower bounds and so on. In addition, we provide the number of zeros of a certain cross-product within a large circle and show that all its zeros are real and simple. These results may be of independent interest.
  The other is to investigate the Dirichlet/Neumann Laplacian on balls and spherical shells in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq 2$) and the remainder of the associated Weyl's law. We obtain new upper bounds in all dimensions, both in the Dirichlet and Neumann cases. The proof relies on our studies of Bessel functions and the latest development in the Gauss circle problem, which was driven by the application of the emerging decoupling theory of harmonic analysis.</description>
