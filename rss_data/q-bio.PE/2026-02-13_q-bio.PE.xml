      <title>MEmilio -- A high performance Modular EpideMIcs simuLatIOn software for multi-scale and comparative simulations of infectious disease dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemic and pandemic preparedness with rapid outbreak response rely on timely, trustworthy evidence. Mathematical models are crucial for supporting timely and reliable evidence generation for public health decision-making with models spanning approaches from compartmental and metapopulation models to detailed agent-based simulations. Yet, the accompanying software ecosystem remains fragmented across model types, spatial resolutions, and computational targets, making models harder to compare, extend, and deploy at scale. Here we present MEmilio, a modular, high-performance framework for epidemic simulation that harmonizes the specification and execution of diverse dynamic epidemiological models within a unified and harmonized architecture. MEmilio couples an efficient C++ simulation core with coherent model descriptions and a user-friendly Python interface, enabling workflows that run on laptops as well as high-performance computing systems. Standardized representations of space, demography, and mobility support straightforward adaptations in resolution and population size, facilitating systematic inter-model comparisons and ensemble studies. The framework integrates readily with established tools for uncertainty quantification and parameter inference, supporting a broad range of applications from scenario exploration to calibration. Finally, strict software-engineering practices, including extensive unit and continuous integration testing, promote robustness and minimize the risk of errors as the framework evolves. By unifying implementations across modeling paradigms, MEmilio aims to lower barriers to reuse and generalize models, enable principled comparisons of implicit assumptions, and accelerate the development of novel approaches that strengthen modeling-based outbreak preparedness.</description>

      <title>Effects of Stochastic Games on Evolutionary Dynamics in Structured Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuously changing environments have a paramount role in the evolution of cooperative behavior. Previous works have shown that the transitions among different games, as the feedback between behaviors and environments, can promote cooperative behavior significantly. Quantitative analysis, however, is limited to homogeneous populations, while realistic populations in nature are often more complex and highly heterogeneous. We hereby provide an analytical treatment of when the evolution of cooperation can be supported in stochastic games, applying to arbitrary spatial heterogeneity and payoff structure. We highlight that the rule and frequency of game changes can have surprisingly diverse effects on evolutionary outcomes, depending on the governing social dilemmas. While stochastic games favor the evolution of cooperation in donation games, this is not the case for public goods games and snowdrift games. Hence, our framework and model results offer a more subtle insight into the long-standing enigma.</description>

      <title>Transition from traveling fronts to diffusion-limited growth in expanding populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion equations describe various spatially extended processes that unfold as traveling fronts moving at constant velocity. We introduce and solve analytically a model that, besides such fronts, supports solutions advancing as the square root of time. These sublinear fronts preserve an invariant shape, with an effective diffusion constant that diverges at the transition to linear spreading. The model applies to dense cellular aggregates of nonmotile cells consuming a diffusible nutrient. The sublinear spread results from biomass redistribution slowing due to nutrient depletion, a phenomenon supported experimentally but often neglected. Our results provide a potential explanation for the linear rather than quadratic increase of colony area with time, which has been observed for many microbes.</description>

      <title>Collaboration drives phase transitions towards cooperation in prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a collaboration ring model -- a network of players playing the prisoner's dilemma game and collaborating among the nearest neighbours by forming coalitions. The microscopic stochastic updating of the players' strategies are driven by their innate nature of seeking selfish gains and shared intentionality. Cooperation emerges in such a structured population through non-equilibrium phase transitions driven by propensity of the players to collaborate and by the benefit that a cooperator generates. The robust results are qualitatively independent of number of neighbours and collaborators.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Integral Projection Models via Genealogical Quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-state structured population models, including integral projection models (IPMs) and age-structured McKendrick equations, link individual life histories to population growth and composition, yet the demographic meaning of their dominant eigenstructure can be difficult to interpret. A main goal of this paper is to derive interpretable demographic indicators for multi-state heterogeneity -- in particular expected generation numbers, which act as an effective genealogical memory length (in generations) of the ancestry-weighted contributions driving growth -- together with type reproduction numbers and generation intervals, directly from life-history transition kernels.
  To this end we develop a determinant-free genealogical framework based on a reference-point operator, a rank-one construction at the kernel level that singles out a biologically chosen reference state and organizes lineages by their contributions relative to that state. This yields stable distributions and reproductive values as convergent series of iterated kernels, and leads to an Euler--Lotka-like characteristic equation expressed by reference-point moments. The resulting expansion admits a closed combinatorial form via ordinary partial Bell polynomials, providing a direct bridge from transition kernels to genealogical quantities.
  We extend the approach to multi-state McKendrick equations and show how these indicators quantify how population scale and composition are determined by ancestry-weighted initial-state information. The framework avoids restrictive Hilbert--Schmidt assumptions and clarifies how temporal memory and multi-type heterogeneity emerge from cross-generational accumulation, yielding a unified and interpretable route from transition kernels to multi-state demographic indicators.</description>

      <title>Daring few, patient many: division of labor in decentralized foraging collectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do social animals make effective decisions in the absence of a leader? While coordination can improve accuracy, it also introduces delays as information propagates through the group. In changing environments, these delays can outweigh the benefits of globally coordinated decisions, even when local interactions remain tightly organized. This raises a key question: how can groups implement efficient collective decision-making without central coordination? We address this question using a collective foraging model in which individuals share information and rewards, but each must choose whether to bear the cost of exploring or to remain idle. We show that decentralized collectives can match the performance of centrally controlled groups through a division of labor: a small, heterogeneous subset explores even when expected rewards are negative, acquiring information to enable future foraging, while a coordinated majority forages only when expected rewards are positive. Information redundancy causes the optimal number of explorers to grow sublinearly with group size, so that larger groups need proportionally fewer explorers. The heterogeneity of the group is maximized at intermediate ecological pressures, but optimal groups are homogeneous when costs or fluctuations are extreme. Crucially, these group-level policies do not require central coordination, emerging instead from agents following simple threshold-based decision rules. We thus demonstrate a mechanism through which leaderless collectives can make effective decisions under uncertainty and show how ecological pressures can drive changes in the distribution of strategies employed by the group.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Function Diversity and Specialization Across Socioeconomic and Biological Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function diversity, the range of tasks individuals perform, and specialization, the distribution of function abundances, are fundamental to complex adaptive systems. In the absence of overarching principles, these properties have appeared domain-specific. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification and specialization of functions across disparate systems, including bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. We find that the number of functions grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents from 0.35 to 0.57, consistent with Heaps' Law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic scaling. To explain these empirical findings, we generalize the Yule-Simon model by introducing two key parameters: a diversification parameter that characterizes how existing functions inhibit the creation of new ones, and a specialization parameter that describes how a function's attractiveness depends on its abundance. Our model enables cross-system comparisons, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas. The analysis suggests that what drives the creation of new functions depends on the system's goals and structure: federal agencies tend to ensure comprehensive coverage of necessary functions; cities tend to slow the creation of new occupations as existing ones expand; and cells occupy an intermediate position. Once functions are introduced, their growth follows a remarkably universal pattern across all systems.</description>
